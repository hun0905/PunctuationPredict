adrian  kohler <comma> well <comma> we  're  here  today  to  talk  about  the  evolution  of  a  puppet  horse <period> basil  jones <comma> but  actually  we  're  going  to  start  this  evolution  with  a  hyena <period> ak <comma> the  ancestor  of  the  horse <period> okay <comma> we  'll  do  something  with  it <period> hahahaha <period> the  hyena  is  the  ancestor  of  the  horse  because  it  was  part  of  a  production  called  faustus  in  africa <comma> a  handspring  production  from  1995 <comma> where  it  had  to  play  draughts  with  helen  of  troy <period> this  production  was  directed  by  south  african  artist  and  theater  director <comma> william  kentridge <period> so  it  needed  a  very  articulate  front  paw <period> but <comma> like  all  puppets <comma> it  has  other  attributes <period> bj <comma> one  of  them  is  breath <comma> and  it  kind  of  breathes <period> ak <comma> haa  haa  haaa <period> bj <comma> breath  is  really  important  for  us <period> it  's  the  kind  of  original  movement  for  any  puppet  for  us  onstage <period> it  's  the  thing  that  distinguishes  the  puppet <comma> ak <comma> oops <period> bj <comma> from  an  actor <period> puppets  always  have  to  try  to  be  alive <period> it  's  their  kind  of  ur-story  onstage <comma> that  desperation  to  live <period> ak <comma> yeah <comma> it  's  basically  a  dead  object <comma> as  you  can  see <comma> and  it  only  lives  because  you  make  it <period> an  actor  struggles  to  die  onstage <comma> but  a  puppet  has  to  struggle  to  live <period> and  in  a  way  that  's  a  metaphor  for  life <period> bj <comma> so  every  moment  it  's  on  the  stage <comma> it  's  making  the  struggle <period> so  we  call  this  a  piece  of  emotional  engineering  that  uses  up-to-the-minute  17th  century  technology <comma> to  turn  nouns  into  verbs <period> ak <comma> well  actually  i  prefer  to  say  that  it  's  an  object  constructed  out  of  wood  and  cloth  with  movement  built  into  it  to  persuade  you  to  believe  that  it  has  life <period> bj <comma> okay  so <period> ak <comma> it  has  ears  that  move  passively  when  the  head  goes <period> bj <comma> and  it  has  these  bulkheads  made  out  of  plywood <comma> covered  with  fabric <comma> curiously  similar <comma> in  fact <comma> to  the  plywood  canoes  that  adrian  's  father  used  to  make  when  he  was  a  boy  in  their  workshop <period> ak <comma> in  port  elizabeth <comma> the  village  outside  port  elizabeth  in  south  africa <period> bj <comma> his  mother  was  a  puppeteer <period> and  when  we  met  at  art  school  and  fell  in  love  in  1971 <comma> i  hated  puppets <period> i  really  thought  they  were  so  beneath  me <period> i  wanted  to  become  an  avant-garde  artist <comma> and  punch  and  judy  was  certainly  not  where  i  wanted  to  go <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> it  took  about  10  years <period> to  discover  the  bambara  bamana  puppets  of  mali  in  west  africa <comma> where  there  's  a  fabulous  tradition  of  puppetry <comma> to  learn  a  renewed <comma> or  a  new <comma> respect  for  this  art  form <period> ak <comma> so  in  1981 <comma> i  persuaded  basil  and  some  friends  of  mine  to  form  a  puppet  company <period> and  20  years  later <comma> miraculously <comma> we  collaborated  with  a  company  from  mali <comma> the  sogolon  marionette  troupe  of  bamako <comma> where  we  made  a  piece  about  a  tall  giraffe <period> it  was  just  called  tall  horse <comma> which  was  a  life-sized  giraffe <period> bj <comma> and  here  again <comma> you  see  the  same  structure <period> the  bulkheads  have  now  turned  into  hoops  of  cane <comma> but  it  's  ultimately  the  same  structure <period> it  's  got  two  people  inside  it  on  stilts <comma> which  give  them  the  height <comma> and  somebody  in  the  front  who  's  using  a  kind  of  steering  wheel  to  move  that  head <period> ak <comma> the  person  in  the  hind  legs  is  also  controlling  the  tail <comma> a  bit  like  the  hyena <comma> same  mechanism <comma> just  a  bit  bigger <period> and  he  's  controlling  the  ear  movement <period> bj <comma> so  this  production  was  seen  by  tom  morris  of  the  national  theatre  in  london <period> and  just  around  that  time <comma> his  mother  had  said <comma> have  you  seen  this  book  by  michael  morpurgo  called  war  horse' <questionmark> ak <comma> it  's  about  a  boy  who  falls  in  love  with  a  horse <period> the  horse  is  sold  to  the  first  world  war <comma> and  he  joins  up  to  find  his  horse <period> bj <comma> so  tom  gave  us  a  call  and  said <comma> do  you  think  you  could  make  us  a  horse  for  a  show  to  happen  at  the  national  theatre <questionmark> ak <comma> it  seemed  a  lovely  idea <period> bj <comma> but  it  had  to  ride <period> it  had  to  have  a  rider <period> ak <comma> it  had  to  have  a  rider <comma> and  it  had  to  participate  in  cavalry  charges <period> a  play  about  early  20th  century  plowing  technology  and  cavalry  charges  was  a  little  bit  of  a  challenge  for  the  accounting  department  at  the  national  theatre  in  london <period> but  they  agreed  to  go  along  with  it  for  a  while <period> so  we  began  with  a  test <period> bj <comma> this  is  adrian  and  thys  stander <comma> who  went  on  to  actually  design  the  cane  system  for  the  horse <comma> and  our  next-door  neighbor  katherine <comma> riding  on  a  ladder <period> the  weight  is  really  difficult  when  it  's  up  above  your  head <period> ak <comma> and  once  we  put  katherine  through  that  particular  brand  of  hell <comma> we  knew  that  we  might  be  able  to  make  a  horse <comma> which  could  be  ridden <period> so  we  made  a  model <period> this  is  a  cardboard  model <comma> a  little  bit  smaller  than  the  hyena <period> you  'll  notice  that  the  legs  are  plywood  legs  and  the  canoe  structure  is  still  there <period> bj <comma> and  the  two  manipulators  are  inside <period> but  we  did  n't  realize  at  the  time  that  we  actually  needed  a  third  manipulator <comma> because  we  could  n't  manipulate  the  neck  from  inside  and  walk  the  horse  at  the  same  time <period> ak <comma> we  started  work  on  the  prototype  after  the  model  was  approved <comma> and  the  prototype  took  a  bit  longer  than  we  anticipated <period> we  had  to  throw  out  the  plywood  legs  and  make  new  cane  ones <period> and  we  had  a  crate  built  for  it <period> it  had  to  be  shipped  to  london <period> we  were  going  to  test-drive  it  on  the  street  outside  of  our  house  in  cape  town <comma> and  it  got  to  midnight  and  we  had  n't  done  that  yet <period> bj <comma> so  we  got  a  camera <comma> and  we  posed  the  puppet  in  various  galloping  stances <period> and  we  sent  it  off  to  the  national  theatre <comma> hoping  that  they  believed  that  we  created  something  that  worked <period> ak <comma> a  month  later <comma> we  were  there  in  london  with  this  big  box  and  a  studio  full  of  people  about  to  work  with  us <period> bj <comma> about  40  people <period> ak <comma> we  were  terrified <period> we  opened  the  lid <comma> we  took  the  horse  out <comma> and  it  did  work <period> it  walked  and  it  was  able  to  be  ridden <period> here  i  have  an  18-second  clip  of  the  very  first  walk  of  the  prototype <period> this  is  in  the  national  theatre  studio <comma> the  place  where  they  cook  new  ideas <period> it  had  by  no  means  got  the  green  light  yet <period> the  choreographer <comma> toby  sedgwick <comma> invented  a  beautiful  sequence  where  the  baby  horse <comma> which  was  made  out  of  sticks  and  bits  of  twigs <comma> grew  up  into  the  big  horse <period> and  nick  starr <comma> the  director  of  the  national  theatre <comma> saw  that  particular  moment <comma> he  was  standing  next  to  me <comma> he  nearly  wet  himself <period> and  so  the  show  was  given  the  green  light <period> and  we  went  back  to  cape  town  and  redesigned  the  horse  completely <period> here  is  the  plan <period> and  here  is  our  factory  in  cape  town  where  we  make  horses <period> you  can  see  quite  a  lot  of  skeletons  in  the  background  there <period> the  horses  are  completely  handmade <period> there  is  very  little  20th  century  technology  in  them <period> we  used  a  bit  of  laser  cutting  on  the  plywood  and  some  of  the  aluminum  pieces <period> but  because  they  have  to  be  light  and  flexible <comma> and  each  one  of  them  is  different <comma> they  cannot  be  mass-produced <comma> unfortunately <period> so  here  are  some  half-finished  horses  ready  to  be  worked  in  london <period> and  now  we  would  like  to  introduce  you  to  joey <period> joey  boy <comma> you  there <questionmark> joey <period> joey <period> joey <comma> come  here <period> no <comma> no <comma> i  have  n't  got  it <period> he  's  got  it <period> it  's  in  his  pocket <period> bj <comma> joey <period> ak <comma> joey <comma> joey <comma> joey <comma> joey <period> come  here <period> stand  here  where  people  can  see  you <period> move  around <period> come  on <period> i'd  just  like  to  describe <comma> i  wo  n't  talk  too  loud <period> he  might  get  irritated <period> here <comma> craig  is  working  the  head <period> he  has  bicycle  brake  cables  going  down  to  the  head  control  in  his  hand <period> each  one  of  them  operates  either  an  ear <comma> separately <comma> or  the  head <comma> up  and  down <period> but  he  also  controls  the  head  directly  by  using  his  hand <period> the  ears  are  obviously  a  very  important  emotional  indicator  of  the  horse <period> when  they  point  right  back <comma> the  horse  is  fearful  or  angry <comma> depending  upon  what  's  going  on  in  front  of  him <comma> around  him <period> or <comma> when  he  's  more  relaxed <comma> the  head  comes  down  and  the  ears  listen <comma> either  side <period> horses  hearing  is  very  important <period> it  's  almost  more  important  than  their  eyesight <period> over  here <comma> tommy  's  got  what  you  call  the  heart  position <period> he  's  working  the  leg <period> you  see  the  string  tendon  from  the  hyena <comma> the  hyena  's  front  leg <comma> automatically  pulls  the  hoop  up <period> horses  are  so  unpredictable <period> the  way  a  hoof  comes  up  with  a  horse  immediately  gives  you  the  feeling  that  it  's  a  convincing  horse  action <period> the  hind  legs  have  got  the  same  action <period> bj <comma> and  mikey  also  has <comma> in  his  fingers <comma> the  ability  to  move  the  tail  from  left  to  right <comma> and  up  and  down  with  the  other  hand <period> and  together <comma> there  's  quite  a  complex  possibility  of  tail  expression <period> ak <comma> you  want  to  say  something  about  the  breathing <questionmark> bj <comma> we  had  a  big  challenge  with  breathing <period> adrian  thought  that  he  was  going  to  have  to  split  the  chest  of  the  puppet  in  two  and  make  it  breathe  like  that <comma> because  that  's  how  a  horse  would  breathe <comma> with  an  expanded  chest <period> but  we  realized  that <comma> if  that  were  to  be  happening <comma> you  would  n't <comma> as  an  audience <comma> see  the  breath <period> so  he  made  a  channel  in  here <comma> and  the  chest  moves  up  and  down  in  that  channel <period> so  it  's  anti-naturalistic  really <comma> the  up  and  down  movement <comma> but  it  feels  like  breath <period> and  it  's  very <comma> very  simple  because  all  that  happens  is  that  the  puppeteer  breathes  with  his  knees <period> ak <comma> other  emotional  stuff <period> if  i  were  to  touch  the  horse  here  on  his  skin <comma> the  heart  puppeteer  can  shake  the  body  from  inside  and  get  the  skin  to  quiver <period> you  'll  notice <comma> of  course <comma> that  the  puppet  is  made  out  of  cane  lines <period> and  i  would  like  you  to  believe  that  it  was  an  aesthetic  choice <comma> that  i  was  making  a  three-dimensional  drawing  of  a  horse  that  somehow  moves  in  space <period> but  of  course <comma> it  was  the  cane  is  light <comma> the  cane  is  flexible <comma> the  cane  is  durable  and  the  cane  is  moldable <period> and  so  it  was  a  very  practical  reason  why  it  was  made  of  cane <period> the  skin  itself  is  made  out  of  a  see-through  nylon  mesh <comma> which <comma> if  the  lighting  designer  wants  the  horse  to  almost  disappear <comma> she  can  light  the  background  and  the  horse  becomes  ghostlike <period> you  see  the  skeletal  structure  of  it <period> or  if  you  light  it  from  above <comma> it  becomes  more  solid <period> again <comma> that  was  a  practical  consideration <period> the  guys  inside  the  horse  have  to  be  able  to  see  out <period> they  have  to  be  able  to  act  along  with  their  fellow  actors  in  the  production <period> and  it  's  very  much  an  in-the-moment  activity  that  they  're  engaged  in <period> it  's  three  heads  making  one  character <period> but  now  we  would  like  you  to  put  joey  through  some  paces <period> and  plant <period> thank  you <period> and  now  just <comma> all  the  way  from  sunny  california  we  have  zem  joaquin  who  's  going  to  ride  the  horse  for  us <period> so  we  would  like  to  stress  that  the  performance  you  see  in  the  horse  is  three  guys  who  have  studied  horse  behavior  incredibly  thoroughly <period> bj <comma> not  being  able  to  talk  to  one  another  while  they  're  onstage  because  they  're  mic'd <period> the  sound  that  that  very  large  chest  makes <comma> of  the  horse <comma> the  whinnying  and  the  nickering  and  everything <comma> that  starts  usually  with  one  performer <comma> carries  on  with  a  second  person  and  ends  with  a  third <period> ak <comma> mikey  brett  from  leicestershire <period> mikey  brett <comma> craig <comma> leo <comma> zem  joaquin  and  basil  and  me <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> one  of  the  most  common  ways  of  dividing  the  world  is  into  those  who  believe  and  those  who  do  n't <comma> into  the  religious  and  the  atheists <period> and  for  the  last  decade  or  so <comma> it  's  been  quite  clear  what  being  an  atheist  means <period> there  have  been  some  very  vocal  atheists  who've  pointed  out <comma> not  just  that  religion  is  wrong <comma> but  that  it  's  ridiculous <period> these  people <comma> many  of  whom  have  lived  in  north  oxford <comma> have  argued <comma> they've  argued  that  believing  in  god  is  akin  to  believing  in  fairies  and  essentially  that  the  whole  thing  is  a  childish  game <period> now  i  think  it  's  too  easy <period> i  think  it  's  too  easy  to  dismiss  the  whole  of  religion  that  way <period> and  it  's  as  easy  as  shooting  fish  in  a  barrel <period> and  what  i'd  like  to  inaugurate  today  is  a  new  way  of  being  an  atheist <comma> if  you  like <comma> a  new  version  of  atheism  we  could  call  atheism  20 <period> now  what  is  atheism  20 <questionmark> well  it  starts  from  a  very  basic  premise <comma> of  course <comma> there  's  no  god <period> of  course <comma> there  are  no  deities  or  supernatural  spirits  or  angels <comma> etc <period> now  let  's  move  on <period> that  's  not  the  end  of  the  story <comma> that  's  the  very <comma> very  beginning <period> i  'm  interested  in  the  kind  of  constituency  that  thinks  something  along  these  lines <comma> that  thinks <comma> i  cannot  believe  in  any  of  this  stuff <period> i  cannot  believe  in  the  doctrines <period> i  do  n't  think  these  doctrines  are  right <period> but <comma> a  very  important  but <comma> i  love  christmas  carols <period> i  really  like  the  art  of  mantegna <period> i  really  like  looking  at  old  churches <period> i  really  like  turning  the  pages  of  the  old  testament  whatever  it  may  be <comma> you  know  the  kind  of  thing  i  'm  talking  about <comma> people  who  are  attracted  to  the  ritualistic  side <comma> the  moralistic <comma> communal  side  of  religion <comma> but  cannot  bear  the  doctrine <period> until  now <comma> these  people  have  faced  a  rather  unpleasant  choice <period> it  's  almost  as  though  either  you  accept  the  doctrine  and  then  you  can  have  all  the  nice  stuff <comma> or  you  reject  the  doctrine  and  you  're  living  in  some  kind  of  spiritual  wasteland  under  the  guidance  of  cnn  and  walmart <period> so  that  's  a  sort  of  tough  choice <period> i  do  n't  think  we  have  to  make  that  choice <period> i  think  there  is  an  alternative <period> i  think  there  are  ways <comma> and  i  'm  being  both  very  respectful  and  completely  impious <comma> of  stealing  from  religions <period> if  you  do  n't  believe  in  a  religion <comma> there  's  nothing  wrong  with  picking  and  mixing <comma> with  taking  out  the  best  sides  of  religion <period> and  for  me <comma> atheism  20  is  about  both <comma> as  i  say <comma> a  respectful  and  an  impious  way  of  going  through  religions  and  saying <comma> what  here  could  we  use  the  secular  world  is  full  of  holes <period> we  have  secularized  badly <comma> i  would  argue <period> and  a  thorough  study  of  religion  could  give  us  all  sorts  of  insights  into  areas  of  life  that  are  not  going  too  well <period> and  i'd  like  to  run  through  a  few  of  these  today <period> i'd  like  to  kick  off  by  looking  at  education <period> now  education  is  a  field  the  secular  world  really  believes  in <period> when  we  think  about  how  we  're  going  to  make  the  world  a  better  place <comma> we  think  education <period> that  's  where  we  put  a  lot  of  money <period> education  is  going  to  give  us <comma> not  only  commercial  skills <comma> industrial  skills <comma> it  's  also  going  to  make  us  better  people <period> you  know  the  kind  of  thing  a  commencement  address  is <comma> and  graduation  ceremonies <comma> those  lyrical  claims  that  education <comma> the  process  of  education <comma> particularly  higher  education <comma> will  make  us  into  nobler  and  better  human  beings <period> that  's  a  lovely  idea <period> interesting  where  it  came  from <period> in  the  early  19th  century <comma> church  attendance  in  western  europe  started  sliding  down  very <comma> very  sharply <comma> and  people  panicked <period> they  asked  themselves  the  following  question <period> they  said <comma> where  are  people  going  to  find  the  morality <comma> where  are  they  going  to  find  guidance <comma> and  where  are  they  going  to  find  sources  of  consolation <questionmark> and  influential  voices  came  up  with  one  answer <period> they  said  culture <period> it  's  to  culture  that  we  should  look  for  guidance <comma> for  consolation <comma> for  morality <period> let  's  look  to  the  plays  of  shakespeare <comma> the  dialogues  of  plato <comma> the  novels  of  jane  austen <period> in  there <comma> we  'll  find  a  lot  of  the  truths  that  we  might  previously  have  found  in  the  gospel  of  saint  john <period> now  i  think  that  's  a  very  beautiful  idea  and  a  very  true  idea <period> they  wanted  to  replace  scripture  with  culture <period> and  that  's  a  very  plausible  idea <period> it  's  also  an  idea  that  we  have  forgotten <period> if  you  went  to  a  top  university <comma> let  's  say  you  went  to  harvard  or  oxford  or  cambridge <comma> and  you  said <comma> i've  come  here  because  i  'm  in  search  of  morality <comma> guidance  and  consolation <period> i  want  to  know  how  to  live <comma> they  would  show  you  the  way  to  the  insane  asylum <period> this  is  simply  not  what  our  grandest  and  best  institutes  of  higher  learning  are  in  the  business  of <period> why <questionmark> they  do  n't  think  we  need  it <period> they  do  n't  think  we  are  in  an  urgent  need  of  assistance <period> they  see  us  as  adults <comma> rational  adults <period> what  we  need  is  information <period> we  need  data <comma> we  do  n't  need  help <period> now  religions  start  from  a  very  different  place  indeed <period> all  religions <comma> all  major  religions <comma> at  various  points  call  us  children <period> and  like  children <comma> they  believe  that  we  are  in  severe  need  of  assistance <period> we  're  only  just  holding  it  together <period> perhaps  this  is  just  me <comma> maybe  you <period> but  anyway <comma> we  're  only  just  holding  it  together <period> and  we  need  help <period> of  course <comma> we  need  help <period> and  so  we  need  guidance  and  we  need  didactic  learning <period> you  know <comma> in  the  18th  century  in  the  uk <comma> the  greatest  preacher <comma> greatest  religious  preacher <comma> was  a  man  called  john  wesley <comma> who  went  up  and  down  this  country  delivering  sermons <comma> advising  people  how  they  could  live <period> he  delivered  sermons  on  the  duties  of  parents  to  their  children  and  children  to  their  parents <comma> the  duties  of  the  rich  to  the  poor  and  the  poor  to  the  rich <period> he  was  trying  to  tell  people  how  they  should  live  through  the  medium  of  sermons <comma> the  classic  medium  of  delivery  of  religions <period> now  we've  given  up  with  the  idea  of  sermons <period> if  you  said  to  a  modern  liberal  individualist <comma> hey <comma> how  about  a  sermon  they'd  go <comma> no <comma> no <period> i  do  n't  need  one  of  those <period> i  'm  an  independent <comma> individual  person  what  's  the  difference  between  a  sermon  and  our  modern <comma> secular  mode  of  delivery <comma> the  lecture <questionmark> well  a  sermon  wants  to  change  your  life  and  a  lecture  wants  to  give  you  a  bit  of  information <period> and  i  think  we  need  to  get  back  to  that  sermon  tradition <period> the  tradition  of  sermonizing  is  hugely  valuable <comma> because  we  are  in  need  of  guidance <comma> morality  and  consolation <comma> and  religions  know  that <period> another  point  about  education <comma> we  tend  to  believe  in  the  modern  secular  world  that  if  you  tell  someone  something  once <comma> they  'll  remember  it <period> sit  them  in  a  classroom <comma> tell  them  about  plato  at  the  age  of  20 <comma> send  them  out  for  a  career  in  management  consultancy  for  40  years <comma> and  that  lesson  will  stick  with  them <period> religions  go <comma> nonsense <period> you  need  to  keep  repeating  the  lesson  10  times  a  day <period> so  get  on  your  knees  and  repeat  it  that  's  what  all  religions  tell  us <comma> get  on  you  knees  and  repeat  it  10  or  20  or  15  times  a  day  otherwise  our  minds  are  like  sieves <period> so  religions  are  cultures  of  repetition <period> they  circle  the  great  truths  again  and  again  and  again <period> we  associate  repetition  with  boredom <period> give  us  the  new <comma> we  're  always  saying <period> the  new  is  better  than  the  old <period> if  i  said  to  you <comma> okay <comma> we  're  not  going  to  have  new  ted <period> we  're  just  going  to  run  through  all  the  old  ones  and  watch  them  five  times  because  they  're  so  true <period> we  're  going  to  watch  elizabeth  gilbert  five  times  because  what  she  says  is  so  clever <comma> you'd  feel  cheated <period> not  so  if  you  're  adopting  a  religious  mindset <period> the  other  things  that  religions  do  is  to  arrange  time <period> all  the  major  religions  give  us  calendars <period> what  is  a  calendar <questionmark> a  calendar  is  a  way  of  making  sure  that  across  the  year  you  will  bump  into  certain  very  important  ideas <period> in  the  catholic  chronology <comma> catholic  calendar <comma> at  the  end  of  march  you  will  think  about  st <period> jerome  and  his  qualities  of  humility  and  goodness  and  his  generosity  to  the  poor <period> you  wo  n't  do  that  by  accident <period> you  will  do  that  because  you  are  guided  to  do  that <period> now  we  do  n't  think  that  way <period> in  the  secular  world  we  think <comma> if  an  idea  is  important <comma> i  'll  bump  into  it <period> i  'll  just  come  across  it  nonsense <comma> says  the  religious  world  view <period> religious  view  says  we  need  calendars <comma> we  need  to  structure  time <comma> we  need  to  synchronize  encounters <period> this  comes  across  also  in  the  way  in  which  religions  set  up  rituals  around  important  feelings <period> take  the  moon <period> it  's  really  important  to  look  at  the  moon <period> you  know <comma> when  you  look  at  the  moon <comma> you  think <comma> i  'm  really  small <period> what  are  my  problems  it  sets  things  into  perspective <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> we  should  all  look  at  the  moon  a  bit  more  often <period> we  do  n't <period> why  do  n't  we <questionmark> well  there  's  nothing  to  tell  us <comma> look  at  the  moon  but  if  you  're  a  zen  buddhist  in  the  middle  of  september <comma> you  will  be  ordered  out  of  your  home <comma> made  to  stand  on  a  canonical  platform  and  made  to  celebrate  the  festival  of  tsukimi <comma> where  you  will  be  given  poems  to  read  in  honor  of  the  moon  and  the  passage  of  time  and  the  frailty  of  life  that  it  should  remind  us  of <period> you  'll  be  handed  rice  cakes <period> and  the  moon  and  the  reflection  on  the  moon  will  have  a  secure  place  in  your  heart <period> that  's  very  good <period> the  other  thing  that  religions  are  really  aware  of  is <comma> speak  well <comma> i  'm  not  doing  a  very  good  job  of  this  here <comma> but  oratory <comma> oratory  is  absolutely  key  to  religions <period> in  the  secular  world <comma> you  can  come  through  the  university  system  and  be  a  lousy  speaker  and  still  have  a  great  career <period> but  the  religious  world  does  n't  think  that  way <period> what  you  're  saying  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  a  really  convincing  way  of  saying  it <period> so  if  you  go  to  an  african  american  pentecostalist  church  in  the  american  south  and  you  listen  to  how  they  talk <comma> my  goodness <comma> they  talk  well <period> after  every  convincing  point <comma> people  will  go <comma> amen <comma> amen <comma> amen  at  the  end  of  a  really  rousing  paragraph <comma> they  'll  all  stand  up <comma> and  they  'll  go <comma> thank  you  jesus <comma> thank  you  christ <comma> thank  you  savior  if  we  were  doing  it  like  they  do  it <comma> let  's  not  do  it <comma> but  if  we  were  to  do  it <comma> i  would  tell  you  something  like <comma> culture  should  replace  scripture  and  you  would  go <comma> amen <comma> amen <comma> amen  and  at  the  end  of  my  talk <comma> you  would  all  stand  up  and  you  would  go <comma> thank  you  plato <comma> thank  you  shakespeare <comma> thank  you  jane  austen  and  we'd  know  that  we  had  a  real  rhythm  going <period> all  right <comma> all  right <period> we  're  getting  there <period> we  're  getting  there <period> the  other  thing  that  religions  know  is  we  're  not  just  brains <comma> we  are  also  bodies <period> and  when  they  teach  us  a  lesson <comma> they  do  it  via  the  body <period> so  for  example <comma> take  the  jewish  idea  of  forgiveness <period> jews  are  very  interested  in  forgiveness  and  how  we  should  start  anew  and  start  afresh <period> they  do  n't  just  deliver  us  sermons  on  this <period> they  do  n't  just  give  us  books  or  words  about  this <period> they  tell  us  to  have  a  bath <period> so  in  orthodox  jewish  communities <comma> every  friday  you  go  to  a  mikveh <period> you  immerse  yourself  in  the  water <comma> and  a  physical  action  backs  up  a  philosophical  idea <period> we  do  n't  tend  to  do  that <period> our  ideas  are  in  one  area  and  our  behavior  with  our  bodies  is  in  another <period> religions  are  fascinating  in  the  way  they  try  and  combine  the  two <period> let  's  look  at  art  now <period> now  art  is  something  that  in  the  secular  world <comma> we  think  very  highly  of <period> we  think  art  is  really <comma> really  important <period> a  lot  of  our  surplus  wealth  goes  to  museums <comma> etc <period> we  sometimes  hear  it  said  that  museums  are  our  new  cathedrals <comma> or  our  new  churches <period> you've  heard  that  saying <period> now  i  think  that  the  potential  is  there <period> but  we've  completely  let  ourselves  down <period> and  the  reason  we've  let  ourselves  down  is  that  we  're  not  properly  studying  how  religions  handle  art <period> the  two  really  bad  ideas  that  are  hovering  in  the  modern  world  that  inhibit  our  capacity  to  draw  strength  from  art <comma> the  first  idea  is  that  art  should  be  for  art  's  sake <comma> a  ridiculous  idea <comma> an  idea  that  art  should  live  in  a  hermetic  bubble  and  should  not  try  to  do  anything  with  this  troubled  world <period> i  could  n't  disagree  more <period> the  other  thing  that  we  believe  is  that  art  should  n't  explain  itself <comma> that  artists  should  n't  say  what  they  're  up  to <comma> because  if  they  said  it <comma> it  might  destroy  the  spell  and  we  might  find  it  too  easy <period> that  's  why  a  very  common  feeling  when  you  're  in  a  museum <comma> let  's  admit  it <comma> is <comma> i  do  n't  know  what  this  is  about  but  if  we  're  serious  people <comma> we  do  n't  admit  to  that <period> but  that  feeling  of  puzzlement  is  structural  to  contemporary  art <period> now  religions  have  a  much  saner  attitude  to  art <period> they  have  no  trouble  telling  us  what  art  is  about <period> art  is  about  two  things  in  all  the  major  faiths <period> firstly <comma> it  's  trying  to  remind  you  of  what  there  is  to  love <period> and  secondly <comma> it  's  trying  to  remind  you  of  what  there  is  to  fear  and  to  hate <period> and  that  's  what  art  is <period> art  is  a  visceral  encounter  with  the  most  important  ideas  of  your  faith <period> so  as  you  walk  around  a  church <comma> or  a  mosque  or  a  cathedral <comma> what  you  're  trying  to  imbibe <comma> what  you  're  imbibing  is <comma> through  your  eyes <comma> through  your  senses <comma> truths  that  have  otherwise  come  to  you  through  your  mind <period> essentially  it  's  propaganda <period> rembrandt  is  a  propagandist  in  the  christian  view <period> now  the  word  propaganda  sets  off  alarm  bells <period> we  think  of  hitler <comma> we  think  of  stalin <period> do  n't <comma> necessarily <period> propaganda  is  a  manner  of  being  didactic  in  honor  of  something <period> and  if  that  thing  is  good <comma> there  's  no  problem  with  it  at  all <period> my  view  is  that  museums  should  take  a  leaf  out  of  the  book  of  religions <period> and  they  should  make  sure  that  when  you  walk  into  a  museum <comma> if  i  was  a  museum  curator <comma> i  would  make  a  room  for  love <comma> a  room  for  generosity <period> all  works  of  art  are  talking  to  us  about  things <period> and  if  we  were  able  to  arrange  spaces  where  we  could  come  across  works  where  we  would  be  told <comma> use  these  works  of  art  to  cement  these  ideas  in  your  mind <comma> we  would  get  a  lot  more  out  of  art <period> art  would  pick  up  the  duty  that  it  used  to  have  and  that  we've  neglected  because  of  certain  mis-founded  ideas <period> art  should  be  one  of  the  tools  by  which  we  improve  our  society <period> art  should  be  didactic <period> let  's  think  of  something  else <period> the  people  in  the  modern  world <comma> in  the  secular  world <comma> who  are  interested  in  matters  of  the  spirit <comma> in  matters  of  the  mind <comma> in  higher  soul-like  concerns <comma> tend  to  be  isolated  individuals <period> they  're  poets <comma> they  're  philosophers <comma> they  're  photographers <comma> they  're  filmmakers <period> and  they  tend  to  be  on  their  own <period> they  're  our  cottage  industries <period> they  are  vulnerable <comma> single  people <period> and  they  get  depressed  and  they  get  sad  on  their  own <period> and  they  do  n't  really  change  much <period> now  think  about  religions <comma> think  about  organized  religions <period> what  do  organized  religions  do <questionmark> they  group  together <comma> they  form  institutions <period> and  that  has  all  sorts  of  advantages <period> first  of  all <comma> scale <comma> might <period> the  catholic  church  pulled  in  97  billion  dollars  last  year  according  to  the  wall  street  journal <period> these  are  massive  machines <period> they  're  collaborative <comma> they  're  branded <comma> they  're  multinational <comma> and  they  're  highly  disciplined <period> these  are  all  very  good  qualities <period> we  recognize  them  in  relation  to  corporations <period> and  corporations  are  very  like  religions  in  many  ways <comma> except  they  're  right  down  at  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid  of  needs <period> they  're  selling  us  shoes  and  cars <period> whereas  the  people  who  are  selling  us  the  higher  stuff <comma> the  therapists <comma> the  poets <comma> are  on  their  own  and  they  have  no  power <comma> they  have  no  might <period> so  religions  are  the  foremost  example  of  an  institution  that  is  fighting  for  the  things  of  the  mind <period> now  we  may  not  agree  with  what  religions  are  trying  to  teach  us <comma> but  we  can  admire  the  institutional  way  in  which  they  're  doing  it <period> books  alone <comma> books  written  by  lone  individuals <comma> are  not  going  to  change  anything <period> we  need  to  group  together <period> if  you  want  to  change  the  world <comma> you  have  to  group  together <comma> you  have  to  be  collaborative <period> and  that  's  what  religions  do <period> they  are  multinational <comma> as  i  say <comma> they  are  branded <comma> they  have  a  clear  identity <comma> so  they  do  n't  get  lost  in  a  busy  world <period> that  's  something  we  can  learn  from <period> i  want  to  conclude <period> really  what  i  want  to  say  is  for  many  of  you  who  are  operating  in  a  range  of  different  fields <comma> there  is  something  to  learn  from  the  example  of  religion <comma> even  if  you  do  n't  believe  any  of  it <period> if  you  're  involved  in  anything  that  's  communal <comma> that  involves  lots  of  people  getting  together <comma> there  are  things  for  you  in  religion <period> if  you  're  involved <comma> say <comma> in  a  travel  industry  in  any  way <comma> look  at  pilgrimage <period> look  very  closely  at  pilgrimage <period> we  have  n't  begun  to  scratch  the  surface  of  what  travel  could  be  because  we  have  n't  looked  at  what  religions  do  with  travel <period> if  you  're  in  the  art  world <comma> look  at  the  example  of  what  religions  are  doing  with  art <period> and  if  you  're  an  educator  in  any  way <comma> again <comma> look  at  how  religions  are  spreading  ideas <period> you  may  not  agree  with  the  ideas <comma> but  my  goodness <comma> they  're  highly  effective  mechanisms  for  doing  so <period> so  really  my  concluding  point  is  you  may  not  agree  with  religion <comma> but  at  the  end  of  the  day <comma> religions  are  so  subtle <comma> so  complicated <comma> so  intelligent  in  many  ways  that  they  're  not  fit  to  be  abandoned  to  the  religious  alone <period> they  're  for  all  of  us <period> thank  you  very  much <period> chris  anderson <comma> now  this  is  actually  a  courageous  talk <comma> because  you  're  kind  of  setting  up  yourself  in  some  ways  to  be  ridiculed  in  some  quarters <period> ab <comma> you  can  get  shot  by  both  sides <period> you  can  get  shot  by  the  hard-headed  atheists <comma> and  you  can  get  shot  by  those  who  fully  believe <period> ca <comma> incoming  missiles  from  north  oxford  at  any  moment <period> ab <comma> indeed <period> ca <comma> but  you  left  out  one  aspect  of  religion  that  a  lot  of  people  might  say  your  agenda  could  borrow  from <comma> which  is  this  sense <comma> that  's  actually  probably  the  most  important  thing  to  anyone  who  's  religious <comma> of  spiritual  experience <comma> of  some  kind  of  connection  with  something  that  's  bigger  than  you  are <period> is  there  any  room  for  that  experience  in  atheism  20 <questionmark> ab <comma> absolutely <period> i <comma> like  many  of  you <comma> meet  people  who  say  things  like <comma> but  is  n't  there  something  bigger  than  us <comma> something  else  and  i  say <comma> of  course  and  they  say <comma> so  are  n't  you  sort  of  religious  and  i  go <comma> no  why  does  that  sense  of  mystery <comma> that  sense  of  the  dizzying  scale  of  the  universe <comma> need  to  be  accompanied  by  a  mystical  feeling <questionmark> science  and  just  observation  gives  us  that  feeling  without  it <comma> so  i  do  n't  feel  the  need <period> the  universe  is  large  and  we  are  tiny <comma> without  the  need  for  further  religious  superstructure <period> so  one  can  have  so-called  spiritual  moments  without  belief  in  the  spirit <period> ca <comma> actually <comma> let  me  just  ask  a  question <period> how  many  people  here  would  say  that  religion  is  important  to  them <questionmark> is  there  an  equivalent  process  by  which  there  's  a  sort  of  bridge  between  what  you  're  talking  about  and  what  you  would  say  to  them <questionmark> ab <comma> i  would  say  that  there  are  many <comma> many  gaps  in  secular  life  and  these  can  be  plugged <period> it  's  not  as  though <comma> as  i  try  to  suggest <comma> it  's  not  as  though  either  you  have  religion  and  then  you  have  to  accept  all  sorts  of  things <comma> or  you  do  n't  have  religion  and  then  you  're  cut  off  from  all  these  very  good  things <period> it  's  so  sad  that  we  constantly  say <comma> i  do  n't  believe  so  i  cannot  have  community <comma> so  i  'm  cut  off  from  morality <comma> so  i  cannot  go  on  a  pilgrimage  one  wants  to  say <comma> nonsense <period> why  not  and  that  's  really  the  spirit  of  my  talk <period> there  's  so  much  we  can  absorb <period> atheism  should  n't  cut  itself  off  from  the  rich  sources  of  religion <period> ca <comma> it  seems  to  me  that  there  's  plenty  of  people  in  the  ted  community  who  are  atheists <period> but  probably  most  people  in  the  community  certainly  do  n't  think  that  religion  is  going  away  any  time  soon  and  want  to  find  the  language  to  have  a  constructive  dialogue  and  to  feel  like  we  can  actually  talk  to  each  other  and  at  least  share  some  things  in  common <period> are  we  foolish  to  be  optimistic  about  the  possibility  of  a  world  where <comma> instead  of  religion  being  the  great  rallying  cry  of  divide  and  war <comma> that  there  could  be  bridging <questionmark> ab <comma> no <comma> we  need  to  be  polite  about  differences <period> politeness  is  a  much-overlooked  virtue <period> it  's  seen  as  hypocrisy <period> but  we  need  to  get  to  a  stage  when  you  're  an  atheist  and  someone  says <comma> well  you  know <comma> i  did  pray  the  other  day <comma> you  politely  ignore  it <period> you  move  on <period> because  you've  agreed  on  90  percent  of  things <comma> because  you  have  a  shared  view  on  so  many  things <comma> and  you  politely  differ <period> and  i  think  that  's  what  the  religious  wars  of  late  have  ignored <period> they've  ignored  the  possibility  of  harmonious  disagreement <period> ca <comma> and  finally <comma> does  this  new  thing  that  you  're  proposing  that  's  not  a  religion  but  something  else <comma> does  it  need  a  leader <comma> and  are  you  volunteering  to  be  the  pope <questionmark> ab <comma> well <comma> one  thing  that  we  're  all  very  suspicious  of  is  individual  leaders <period> it  does  n't  need  it <period> what  i've  tried  to  lay  out  is  a  framework  and  i  'm  hoping  that  people  can  just  fill  it  in <period> i've  sketched  a  sort  of  broad  framework <period> but  wherever  you  are <comma> as  i  say <comma> if  you  're  in  the  travel  industry <comma> do  that  travel  bit <period> if  you  're  in  the  communal  industry <comma> look  at  religion  and  do  the  communal  bit <period> so  it  's  a  wiki  project <period> ca <comma> alain <comma> thank  you  for  sparking  many  conversations  later <period> sometimes  i  go  browsing  through  a  very  old  magazine <period> i  found  this  observation  test  about  the  story  of  the  ark <period> and  the  artist  that  drew  this  observation  test  did  some  errors <comma> had  some  mistakes  -- <period> there  are  more  or  less  12  mistakes <period> some  of  them  are  very  easy <period> there  is  a  funnel <comma> an  aerial  part <comma> a  lamp  and  clockwork  key  on  the  ark <period> some  of  them  are  about  the  animals <comma> the  number <period> but  there  is  a  much  more  fundamental  mistake  in  the  overall  story  of  the  ark  that  's  not  reported  here <period> and  this  problem  is <comma> where  are  the  plants <questionmark> so  now  we  have  god  that  is  going  to  submerge  earth  permanently  or  at  least  for  a  very  long  period <comma> and  no  one  is  taking  care  of  plants <period> noah  needed  to  take  two  of  every  kind  of  bird <comma> of  every  kind  of  animal <comma> of  every  kind  of  creature  that  moves <comma> but  no  mention  about  plants <period> why <questionmark> in  another  part  of  the  same  story <comma> all  the  living  creatures  are  just  the  living  creatures  that  came  out  from  the  ark <comma> so  birds <comma> livestock  and  wild  animals <period> plants  are  not  living  creatures  -- <period> this  is  the  point <period> that  is  a  point  that  is  not  coming  out  from  the  bible <comma> but  it  's  something  that  really  accompanied  humanity <period> let  's  have  a  look  at  this  nice  code  that  is  coming  from  a  renaissance  book <period> here  we  have  the  description  of  the  order  of  nature <period> it  's  a  nice  description  because  it  's  starting  from  left <comma> you  have  the  stones <comma> immediately  after  the  stones <comma> the  plants  that  are  just  able  to  live <period> we  have  the  animals  that  are  able  to  live  and  to  sense <comma> and  on  the  top  of  the  pyramid <comma> there  is  the  man <period> this  is  not  the  common  man <period> the  homo  studiosus <comma> the  studying  man <period> this  is  quite  comforting  for  people  like  me <comma> i  'm  a  professor <comma> this  to  be  over  there  on  the  top  of  creation <period> but  it  's  something  completely  wrong <period> you  know  very  well  about  professors <period> but  it  's  also  wrong  about  plants <comma> because  plants  are  not  just  able  to  live <period> they  are  able  to  sense <period> they  are  much  more  sophisticated  in  sensing  than  animals <period> just  to  give  you  an  example <comma> every  single  root  apex  is  able  to  detect  and  to  monitor  concurrently  and  continuously  at  least  15  different  chemical  and  physical  parameters <period> and  they  also  are  able  to  show  and  to  exhibit  such  a  wonderful  and  complex  behavior  that  can  be  described  just  with  the  term  of  intelligence <period> well <comma> but  this  is  something <comma> this  underestimation  of  plants  is  something  that  is  always  with  us <period> let  's  have  a  look  at  this  short  movie  now <period> we  have  david  attenborough <period> now  david  attenborough  is  really  a  plant  lover <period> he  did  some  of  the  most  beautiful  movies  about  plant  behavior <period> now <comma> when  he  speaks  about  plants <comma> everything  is  correct <period> when  he  speaks  about  animals <comma> he  tends  to  remove  the  fact  that  plants  exist <period> the  blue  whale <comma> the  biggest  creature  that  exists  on  the  planet  -- <period> that  is  wrong <comma> completely  wrong <period> the  blue  whale <comma> it  's  a  dwarf  if  compared  with  the  real  biggest  creature  that  exists  on  the  planet <comma> that  is <comma> this  wonderful <comma> magnificent  sequoiadendron  giganteum <period> and  this  is  a  living  organism  that  has  a  mass  of  at  least  2,000  tons <period> now <comma> the  story  that  plants  are  some  low-level  organisms  has  been  formalized  many  times  ago  by  aristotle <comma> that  in  de  anima <comma> that  is  a  very  influential  book  for  the  western  civilization <comma> wrote  that  the  plants  are  on  the  edge  between  living  and  not  living <period> they  have  just  a  kind  of  very  low-level  soul <period> it  's  called  the  vegetative  soul <comma> because  they  lack  movement <comma> and  so  they  do  n't  need  to  sense <period> let  's  see <period> okay <comma> some  of  the  movements  of  the  plants  are  very  well-known <period> this  is  a  very  fast  movement <period> this  is  a  dionaea <comma> a  venus  fly  trap  hunting  snails  -- <period> sorry  for  the  snail <period> this  has  been  something  that  has  been  refused  for  centuries <comma> despite  the  evidence <period> no  one  can  say  that  the  plants  were  able  to  eat  an  animal <comma> because  it  was  against  the  order  of  nature <period> but  plants  are  also  able  to  show  a  lot  of  movement <period> some  of  them  are  very  well  known <comma> like  the  flowering <period> it  's  just  a  question  to  use  some  techniques  like  the  time  lapse <period> some  of  them  are  much  more  sophisticated <period> look  at  this  young  bean  that  is  moving  to  catch  the  light  every  time <period> and  it  's  really  so  graceful <period> it  's  like  a  dancing  angel <period> they  are  also  able  to  play  -- <period> they  are  really  playing <period> these  are  young  sunflowers <comma> and  what  they  are  doing  cannot  be  described  with  any  other  terms  than  playing <period> they  are  training  themselves <comma> as  many  young  animals  do <comma> to  the  adult  life  where  they  will  be  called  to  track  the  sun  all  the  day <period> they  are  able  to  respond  to  gravity <comma> of  course <comma> so  the  shoots  are  growing  against  the  vector  of  gravity  and  the  roots  toward  the  vector  of  gravity <period> but  they  are  also  able  to  sleep <period> this  is  one <comma> mimosa  pudica <period> so  during  the  night <comma> they  curl  the  leaves  and  reduce  the  movement <comma> and  during  the  day <comma> you  have  the  opening  of  the  leaves <comma> there  is  much  more  movement <period> this  is  interesting  because  this  sleeping  machinery <comma> it  's  perfectly  conserved <period> it  's  the  same  in  plants <comma> in  insects  and  in  animals <period> and  so  if  you  need  to  study  this  sleeping  problem <comma> it  's  easy  to  study  on  plants <comma> for  example <comma> than  in  animals  and  it  's  much  more  easy  even  ethically <period> it  's  a  kind  of  vegetarian  experimentation <period> plants  are  even  able  to  communicate  -- <period> they  are  extraordinary  communicators <period> they  communicate  with  other  plants <period> they  are  able  to  distinguish  kin  and  non-kin <period> they  communicate  with  plants  of  other  species  and  they  communicate  with  animals  by  producing  chemical  volatiles <comma> for  example <comma> during  the  pollination <period> now  with  the  pollination <comma> it  's  a  very  serious  issue  for  plants <comma> because  they  move  the  pollen  from  one  flower  to  the  other <comma> yet  they  cannot  move  from  one  flower  to  the  other <period> so  they  need  a  vector <comma> and  this  vector <comma> it  's  normally  an  animal <period> many  insects  have  been  used  by  plants  as  vectors  for  the  transport  of  the  pollination <comma> but  not  just  insects <period> even  birds <comma> reptiles <comma> and  mammals  like  bats  rats  are  normally  used  for  the  transportation  of  the  pollen <period> this  is  a  serious  business <period> we  have  the  plants  that  are  giving  to  the  animals  a  kind  of  sweet  substance <comma> very  energizing <comma> having  in  change  this  transportation  of  the  pollen <period> but  some  plants  are  manipulating  animals <comma> like  in  the  case  of  orchids  that  promise  sex  and  nectar  and  give  in  change  nothing  for  the  transportation  of  the  pollen <period> now <comma> there  is  a  big  problem  behind  all  this  behavior  that  we  have  seen <period> how  is  it  possible  to  do  this  without  a  brain <questionmark> we  need  to  wait  until  1880 <comma> when  this  big  man <comma> charles  darwin <comma> publishes  a  wonderful <comma> astonishing  book  that  starts  a  revolution <period> the  title  is  the  power  of  movement  in  plants <period> no  one  was  allowed  to  speak  about  movement  in  plants  before  charles  darwin <period> in  his  book <comma> assisted  by  his  son <comma> francis <comma> who  was  the  first  professor  of  plant  physiology  in  the  world <comma> in  cambridge <comma> they  took  into  consideration  every  single  movement  for  500  pages <period> and  in  the  last  paragraph  of  the  book <comma> it  's  a  kind  of  stylistic  mark <comma> because  normally  charles  darwin  stored <comma> in  the  last  paragraph  of  a  book <comma> the  most  important  message <period> he  wrote  that <comma> it  's  hardly  an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the  tip  of  the  radical  acts  like  the  brain  of  one  of  the  lower  animals <period> this  is  not  a  metaphor <period> he  wrote  some  very  interesting  letters  to  one  of  his  friends  who  was  jd <period> hooker <comma> or  at  that  time <comma> president  of  the  royal  society <comma> so  the  maximum  scientific  authority  in  britain  speaking  about  the  brain  in  the  plants <period> now <comma> this  is  a  root  apex  growing  against  a  slope <period> so  you  can  recognize  this  kind  of  movement <comma> the  same  movement  that  worms <comma> snakes  and  every  animal  that  are  moving  on  the  ground  without  legs  is  able  to  display <period> and  it  's  not  an  easy  movement  because <comma> to  have  this  kind  of  movement <comma> you  need  to  move  different  regions  of  the  root  and  to  synchronize  these  different  regions  without  having  a  brain <period> so  we  studied  the  root  apex  and  we  found  that  there  is  a  specific  region  that  is  here <comma> depicted  in  blue <comma> that  is  called  the  transition  zone <period> and  this  region <comma> it  's  a  very  small  region  -- <period> it  's  less  than  one  millimeter <period> and  in  this  small  region  you  have  the  highest  consumption  of  oxygen  in  the  plants  and  more  important <comma> you  have  these  kinds  of  signals  here <period> the  signals  that  you  are  seeing  here  are  action  potential <comma> are  the  same  signals  that  the  neurons  of  my  brain <comma> of  our  brain <comma> use  to  exchange  information <period> now  we  know  that  a  root  apex  has  just  a  few  hundred  cells  that  show  this  kind  of  feature <comma> but  we  know  how  big  the  root  apparatus  of  a  small  plant <comma> like  a  plant  of  rye <period> we  have  almost  14  million  roots <period> we  have  11  and  a  half  million  root  apex  and  a  total  length  of  600  or  more  kilometers  and  a  very  high  surface  area <period> now  let  's  imagine  that  each  single  root  apex  is  working  in  network  with  all  the  others <period> here  were  have  on  the  left <comma> the  internet  and  on  the  right <comma> the  root  apparatus <period> they  work  in  the  same  way <period> they  are  a  network  of  small  computing  machines <comma> working  in  networks <period> and  why  are  they  so  similar <questionmark> because  they  evolved  for  the  same  reason <comma> to  survive  predation <period> they  work  in  the  same  way <period> so  you  can  remove  90  percent  of  the  root  apparatus  and  the  plants  continue  to  work <period> you  can  remove  90  percent  of  the  internet  and  it  is  continuing  to  work <period> so <comma> a  suggestion  for  the  people  working  with  networks <comma> plants  are  able  to  give  you  good  suggestions  about  how  to  evolve  networks <period> and  another  possibility  is  a  technological  possibility <period> let  's  imagine  that  we  can  build  robots  and  robots  that  are  inspired  by  plants <period> until  now <comma> the  man  was  inspired  just  by  man  or  the  animals  in  producing  a  robot <period> we  have  the  animaloid <comma> and  the  normal  robots  inspired  by  animals <comma> insectoid <comma> so  on <period> we  have  the  androids  that  are  inspired  by  man <period> but  why  have  we  not  any  plantoid <questionmark> well <comma> if  you  want  to  fly <comma> it  's  good  that  you  look  at  birds <comma> to  be  inspired  by  birds <period> but  if  you  want  to  explore  soils <comma> or  if  you  want  to  colonize  new  territory <comma> to  best  thing  that  you  can  do  is  to  be  inspired  by  plants  that  are  masters  in  doing  this <period> we  have  another  possibility  we  are  working  on  in  our  lab <comma> which  is  to  build  hybrids <period> it  's  much  more  easy  to  build  hybrids <period> hybrid  means  it  's  something  that  's  half  living  and  half  machine <period> it  's  much  more  easy  to  work  with  plants  than  with  animals <period> they  have  computing  power <period> they  have  electrical  signals <period> the  connection  with  the  machine  is  much  more  easy <comma> much  more  even  ethically  possible <period> and  these  are  three  possibilities  that  we  are  working  on  to  build  hybrids <comma> driven  by  algae  or  by  the  leaves  at  the  end <comma> by  the  most <comma> most  powerful  parts  of  the  plants <comma> by  the  roots <period> well <comma> thank  you  for  your  attention <period> and  before  i  finish <comma> i  would  like  to  reassure  that  no  snails  were  harmed  in  making  this  presentation <period> thank  you <period> /transcript <period> the  story  i  wanted  to  share  with  you  today  is  my  challenge  as  an  iranian  artist <comma> as  an  iranian  woman  artist <comma> as  an  iranian  woman  artist  living  in  exile <period> well <comma> it  has  its  pluses  and  minuses <period> on  the  dark  side <comma> politics  does  n't  seem  to  escape  people  like  me <period> every  iranian  artist <comma> in  one  form  or  another <comma> is  political <period> politics  have  defined  our  lives <period> if  you  're  living  in  iran <comma> you  're  facing  censorship <comma> harassment <comma> arrest <comma> torture <comma> at  times <comma> execution <period> if  you  're  living  outside  like  me <comma> you  're  faced  with  life  in  exile <comma> the  pain  of  the  longing  and  the  separation  from  your  loved  ones  and  your  family <period> therefore <comma> we  do  n't  find  the  moral <comma> emotional <comma> psychological  and  political  space  to  distance  ourselves  from  the  reality  of  social  responsibility <period> oddly  enough <comma> an  artist  such  as  myself  finds  herself  also  in  the  position  of  being  the  voice <comma> the  speaker  of  my  people <comma> even  if  i  have <comma> indeed <comma> no  access  to  my  own  country <period> also <comma> people  like  myself <comma> we  're  fighting  two  battles  on  different  grounds <period> we  're  being  critical  of  the  west <comma> the  perception  of  the  west  about  our  identity <comma> about  the  image  that  is  constructed  about  us <comma> about  our  women <comma> about  our  politics <comma> about  our  religion <period> we  are  there  to  take  pride  and  insist  on  respect <period> and  at  the  same  time <comma> we  're  fighting  another  battle <period> that  is  our  regime <comma> our  government <comma> our  atrocious  government <comma> that  has  done  every  crime  in  order  to  stay  in  power <period> our  artists  are  at  risk <period> we  are  in  a  position  of  danger <period> we  pose  a  threat  to  the  order  of  the  government <period> but  ironically <comma> this  situation  has  empowered  all  of  us <comma> because  we  are  considered <comma> as  artists <comma> central  to  the  cultural <comma> political <comma> social  discourse  in  iran <period> we  are  there  to  inspire <comma> to  provoke <comma> to  mobilize <comma> to  bring  hope  to  our  people <period> we  are  the  reporters  of  our  people <comma> and  are  communicators  to  the  outside  world <period> art  is  our  weapon <period> culture  is  a  form  of  resistance <period> i  envy  sometimes  the  artists  of  the  west  for  their  freedom  of  expression <period> for  the  fact  that  they  can  distance  themselves  from  the  question  of  politics <period> from  the  fact  that  they  are  only  serving  one  audience <comma> mainly  the  western  culture <period> but  also <comma> i  worry  about  the  west <comma> because  often  in  this  country <comma> in  this  western  world  that  we  have <comma> culture  risks  being  a  form  of  entertainment <period> our  people  depend  on  our  artists <comma> and  culture  is  beyond  communication <period> my  journey  as  an  artist  started  from  a  very <comma> very  personal  place <period> i  did  not  start  to  make  social  commentary  about  my  country <period> the  first  one  that  you  see  in  front  of  you  is  actually  when  i  first  returned  to  iran  after  being  separated  for  a  good  12  years <period> it  was  after  the  islamic  revolution  of  1979 <period> while  i  was  absent  from  iran <comma> the  islamic  revolution  had  descended  on  iran  and  had  entirely  transformed  the  country  from  persian  to  the  islamic  culture <period> i  came  mainly  to  be  reunited  with  my  family  and  to  reconnect  in  a  way  that  i  found  my  place  in  the  society <period> but  instead <comma> i  found  a  country  that  was  totally  ideological  and  that  i  did  n't  recognize  anymore <period> more  so <comma> i  became  very  interested <comma> as  i  was  facing  my  own  personal  dilemmas  and  questions <comma> i  became  immersed  in  the  study  of  the  islamic  revolution <comma> how <comma> indeed <comma> it  had  incredibly  transformed  the  lives  of  iranian  women <period> i  found  the  subject  of  iranian  women  immensely  interesting <comma> in  the  way  the  women  of  iran <comma> historically <comma> seemed  to  embody  the  political  transformation <period> so  in  a  way <comma> by  studying  a  woman <comma> you  can  read  the  structure  and  the  ideology  of  the  country <period> so  i  made  a  group  of  work  that  at  once  faced  my  own  personal  questions  in  life <comma> and  yet  it  brought  my  work  into  a  larger  discourse <comma> the  subject  of  martyrdom <comma> the  question  of  those  who  willingly  stand  in  that  intersection  of  love  of  god <comma> faith <comma> but  violence  and  crime  and  cruelty <period> for  me <comma> this  became  incredibly  important <period> and  yet <comma> i  had  an  unusual  position  toward  this <period> i  was  an  outsider  who  had  come  back  to  iran  to  find  my  place <comma> but  i  was  not  in  a  position  to  be  critical  of  the  government  or  the  ideology  of  the  islamic  revolution <period> this  changed  slowly  as  i  found  my  voice  and  i  discovered  things  that  i  did  n't  know  i  would  discover <period> so  my  art  became  slightly  more  critical <period> my  knife  became  a  little  sharper <period> and  i  fell  into  a  life  in  exile <period> i  am  a  nomadic  artist <period> i  work  in  morocco <comma> in  turkey <comma> in  mexico <period> i  go  everywhere  to  make  believe  it  's  iran <period> now  i  am  making  films <period> last  year <comma> i  finished  a  film  called  women  without  men <period> women  without  men  returns  to  history <comma> but  another  part  of  our  iranian  history <period> it  goes  to  1953  when  american  cia  exercised  a  coup  and  removed  a  democratically  elected  leader <comma> dr.  mossadegh <period> the  book  is  written  by  an  iranian  woman <comma> shahrnush  parsipur <period> it  's  a  magical  realist  novel <period> this  book  is  banned <comma> and  she  spent  five  years  in  prison <period> my  obsession  with  this  book <comma> and  the  reason  i  made  this  into  a  film <comma> is  because  it  at  once  was  addressing  the  question  of  being  a  female <comma> traditionally <comma> historically  in  iran <comma> and  the  question  of  four  women  who  are  all  looking  for  an  idea  of  change <comma> freedom  and  democracy <comma> while  the  country  of  iran <comma> equally <comma> as  if  another  character <comma> also  struggled  for  an  idea  of  freedom  and  democracy  and  independence  from  the  foreign  interventions <period> i  made  this  film  because  i  felt  it  's  important  for  it  to  speak  to  the  westerners  about  our  history  as  a  country <period> that  all  of  you  seem  to  remember  iran  after  the  islamic  revolution <period> that  iran  was  once  a  secular  society <comma> and  we  had  democracy <comma> and  this  democracy  was  stolen  from  us  by  the  american  government <comma> by  the  british  government <period> this  film  also  speaks  to  the  iranian  people  in  asking  them  to  return  to  their  history  and  look  at  themselves  before  they  were  so  islamicized <comma> in  the  way  we  looked <comma> in  the  way  we  played  music <comma> in  the  way  we  had  intellectual  life <period> and  most  of  all <comma> in  the  way  that  we  fought  for  democracy <period> these  are  some  of  the  shots  actually  from  my  film <period> these  are  some  of  the  images  of  the  coup <period> and  we  made  this  film  in  casablanca <comma> recreating  all  the  shots <period> this  film  tried  to  find  a  balance  between  telling  a  political  story <comma> but  also  a  feminine  story <period> being  a  visual  artist <comma> indeed <comma> i  am  foremost  interested  to  make  art <comma> to  make  art  that  transcends  politics <comma> religion <comma> the  question  of  feminism <comma> and  become  an  important <comma> timeless <comma> universal  work  of  art <period> the  challenge  i  have  is  how  to  do  that <period> how  to  tell  a  political  story  but  an  allegorical  story <period> how  to  move  you  with  your  emotions <comma> but  also  make  your  mind  work <period> these  are  some  of  the  images  and  the  characters  of  the  film <period> now  comes  the  green  movement <comma> the  summer  of  2009 <comma> as  my  film  is  released <comma> the  uprising  begins  in  the  streets  of  tehran <period> what  is  unbelievably  ironic  is  the  period  that  we  tried  to  depict  in  the  film <comma> the  cry  for  democracy  and  social  justice <comma> repeats  itself  now  again  in  tehran <period> the  green  movement  significantly  inspired  the  world <period> it  brought  a  lot  of  attention  to  all  those  iranians  who  stand  for  basic  human  rights  and  struggle  for  democracy <period> what  was  most  significant  for  me  was <comma> once  again <comma> the  presence  of  the  women <period> they  're  absolutely  inspirational  for  me <period> if  in  the  islamic  revolution <comma> the  images  of  the  woman  portrayed  were  submissive  and  did  n't  have  a  voice <comma> now  we  saw  a  new  idea  of  feminism  in  the  streets  of  tehran <comma> women  who  were  educated <comma> forward  thinking <comma> non-traditional <comma> sexually  open <comma> fearless  and  seriously  feminist <period> these  women  and  those  young  men  united  iranians  across  the  world <comma> inside  and  outside <period> i  then  discovered  why  i  take  so  much  inspiration  from  iranian  women <period> that <comma> under  all  circumstances <comma> they  have  pushed  the  boundary <period> they  have  confronted  the  authority <period> they  have  broken  every  rule  in  the  smallest  and  the  biggest  way <period> and  once  again <comma> they  proved  themselves <period> i  stand  here  to  say  that  iranian  women  have  found  a  new  voice <comma> and  their  voice  is  giving  me  my  voice <period> and  it  's  a  great  honor  to  be  an  iranian  woman  and  an  iranian  artist <comma> even  if  i  have  to  operate  in  the  west  only  for  now <period> thank  you  so  much <period> so  i  want  to  tell  you  a  story <comma> an  encouraging  story <comma> about  addressing  desperation <comma> depression  and  despair  in  afghanistan <comma> and  what  we  have  learned  from  it <comma> and  how  to  help  people  to  overcome  traumatic  experiences  and  how  to  help  them  to  regain  some  confidence  in  the  time  ahead <comma> in  the  future <comma> and  how  to  participate  again  in  everyday  life <period> so <comma> i  am  a  jungian  psychoanalyst <comma> and  i  went  to  afghanistan  in  january  2004 <comma> by  chance <comma> on  an  assignment  for  medica  mondiale <period> jung  in  afghanistan <comma> you  get  the  picture <period> afghanistan  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world <comma> and  70  percent  of  the  people  are  illiterate <period> war  and  malnutrition  kills  people  together  with  hope <period> you  may  know  this  from  the  media <period> but  what  you  may  not  know  is  that  the  average  age  of  the  afghan  people  is  17  years  old <comma> which  means  they  grow  up  in  such  an  environment  and <comma> i  repeat  myself <comma> in  30  years  of  war <period> so  this  translates  into  ongoing  violence <comma> foreign  interests <comma> bribery <comma> drugs <comma> ethnic  conflicts <comma> bad  health <comma> shame <comma> fear  and  cumulative  traumatic  experiences <period> local  and  foreign  military  are  supposed  to  build  peace  together  with  the  donors  and  the  governmental  and  non-governmental  organizations <period> and  people  had  hope <comma> yes <comma> but  until  they  realized  their  situation  worsens  every  day <comma> either  because  they  are  being  killed  or  because <comma> somehow <comma> they  are  poorer  than  eight  years  ago <period> one  figure  for  that <comma> 54  percent  of  the  children  under  the  age  of  five  years  suffer  from  malnutrition <period> yet <comma> there  is  hope <period> one  day  a  man  told  me <comma> my  future  does  not  look  brilliant <comma> but  i  want  to  have  a  brilliant  future  for  my  son <period> this  is  a  picture  i  took  in  2005 <comma> walking  on  fridays  over  the  hills  in  kabul <period> and  for  me  it  's  a  symbolic  picture  of  an  open  future  for  a  young  generation <period> so <comma> doctors  prescribe  medication <period> and  donors  are  supposed  to  bring  peace  by  building  schools  and  roads <period> military  collect  weapons <comma> and  depression  stays  intact <period> why <questionmark> because  people  do  n't  have  tools  to  cope  with  it <comma> to  get  over  it <period> so <comma> soon  after  my  arrival <comma> i  had  confirmed  something  which  i  had  already  known <period> that  my  instruments  come  from  the  heart  of  modern  europe <comma> yes <period> however <comma> what  can  wound  us  and  our  reaction  to  those  wounds <comma> they  are  universal <period> and  the  big  challenge  was  how  to  understand  the  meaning  of  the  symptom  in  this  specific  cultural  context <period> after  a  counseling  session <comma> a  woman  said  to  me <comma> because  you  have  felt  me <comma> i  can  feel  myself  again <comma> and  i  want  to  participate  again  in  my  family  life <period> this  was  very  important <comma> because  the  family  is  central  in  afghans  social  system <period> no  one  can  survive  alone <period> and  if  people  feel  used <comma> worthless  and  ashamed <comma> because  something  horrible  has  happened  to  them <comma> then  they  retreat <comma> and  they  fall  into  social  isolation <comma> and  they  do  not  dare  to  tell  this  evil  to  other  people  or  to  their  loved  ones <comma> because  they  do  not  want  to  burden  them <period> and  very  often  violence  is  a  way  to  cope  with  it <period> traumatized  people  also  easily  lose  control <comma> symptoms  are  hyper-arousal  and  memory  flashbacks <comma> so  people  are  in  a  constant  fear  that  those  horrible  feelings  of  that  traumatic  event  might  come  back  unexpectedly <comma> suddenly <comma> and  they  cannot  control  it <period> to  compensate  this  loss  of  inner  control <comma> they  try  to  control  the  outside <comma> very  understandably <comma> mostly  the  family <comma> and  unfortunately <comma> this  fits  very  well  into  the  traditional  side <comma> regressive  side <comma> repressive  side <comma> restrictive  side  of  the  cultural  context <period> so <comma> husbands  start  beating  wives <comma> mothers  and  fathers  beat  their  children <comma> and  afterward <comma> they  feel  awful <period> they  did  not  want  to  do  this <comma> it  just  happened  -- <period> they  lost  control <period> the  desperate  try  to  restore  order  and  normality <comma> and  if  we  are  not  able  to  cut  this  circle  of  violence <comma> it  will  be  transferred  to  the  next  generation  without  a  doubt <period> and  partly  this  is  already  happening <period> so  everybody  needs  a  sense  for  the  future <period> and  the  afghan  sense  of  the  future  is  shattered <period> but  let  me  repeat  the  words  of  the  woman <period> because  you  have  felt  me <comma> i  can  feel  myself  again <period> so  the  key  here  is  empathy <period> somebody  has  to  be  a  witness  to  what  has  happened  to  you <period> somebody  has  to  feel  how  you  felt <period> and  somebody  has  to  see  you  and  listen  to  you <period> everybody  must  be  able  to  know  what  he  or  she  has  experienced  is  true <period> and  this  only  goes  with  another  person <period> so  everybody  must  be  able  to  say <comma> this  happened  to  me <comma> and  it  did  this  with  me <comma> but  i  'm  able  to  live  with  it <comma> to  cope  with  it <comma> and  to  learn  from  it <period> and  i  want  to  engage  myself  in  the  bright  future  for  my  children  and  the  children  of  my  children <comma> and  i  will  not  marry-off  my  13  year-old  daughter, <comma> what  happens  too  often  in  afghanistan <period> so  something  can  be  done <comma> even  in  such  extreme  environments  as  afghanistan <period> and  i  started  thinking  about  a  counseling  program <period> but <comma> of  course <comma> i  needed  help  and  funds <period> and  one  evening <comma> i  was  sitting  next  to  a  very  nice  gentleman  in  kabul <comma> and  he  asked  what  i  thought  would  be  good  in  afghanistan <period> and  i  explained  to  him  quickly <comma> i  would  train  psycho-social  counselors <comma> i  would  open  centers <comma> and  i  explained  to  him  why <period> this  man  gave  me  his  contact  details  at  the  end  of  the  evening  and  said <comma> if  you  want  to  do  this <comma> call  me <period> at  that  time <comma> it  was  the  head  of  caritas  germany <period> so <comma> i  was  able  to  launch  a  three-year  project  with  caritas  germany <comma> and  we  trained  30  afghan  women  and  men <comma> and  we  opened  15  counseling  centers  in  kabul <period> this  was  our  sign <comma> it  's  hand-painted <period> and  we  had  45  all  over  kabul <period> eleven  thousand  people  came <comma> more  than  that <period> and  70  percent  regained  their  lives <period> this  was  a  very  exciting  time <comma> developing  this  with  my  wonderful  afghan  team <period> and  they  are  working  with  me  up  to  today <period> we  developed  a  culturally-sensitive  psycho-social  counseling  approach <period> so <comma> from  2008  up  until  today <comma> a  substantial  change  and  step  forward  has  been  taking  place <period> the  european  union  delegation  in  kabul  came  into  this  and  hired  me  to  work  inside  the  ministry  of  public  health <comma> to  lobby  this  approach  -- <period> we  succeeded <period> we  revised  the  mental  health  component  of  the  primary  health  care  services  by  adding  psycho-social  care  and  psycho-social  counselors  to  the  system <period> this  means <comma> certainly <comma> to  retrain  all  health  staff <period> but  for  that <comma> we  already  have  the  training  manuals <comma> which  are  approved  by  the  ministry  and  moreover <comma> this  approach  is  now  part  of  the  mental  health  strategy  in  afghanistan <period> so  we  also  have  implemented  it  already  in  some  selected  clinics  in  three  provinces <comma> and  you  are  the  first  to  see  the  results <period> we  wanted  to  know  if  what  is  being  done  is  effective <period> and  here  you  can  see  the  patients  all  had  symptoms  of  depression <comma> moderate  and  severe <period> and  the  red  line  is  the  treatment  as  usual <comma> medication  with  a  medical  doctor <period> and  all  the  symptoms  stayed  the  same  or  even  got  worse <period> and  the  green  line  is  treatment  with  psycho-social  counseling  only <comma> without  medication <period> and  you  can  see  the  symptoms  almost  completely  go  away <comma> and  the  psycho-social  stress  has  dropped  significantly <comma> which  is  explicable <comma> because  you  cannot  take  away  the  psycho-social  stresses <comma> but  you  can  learn  how  to  cope  with  them <period> so  this  makes  us  very  happy <comma> because  now  we  also  have  some  evidence  that  this  is  working <period> so  here  you  see <comma> this  is  a  health  facility  in  northern  afghanistan <comma> and  every  morning  it  looks  like  this  all  over <period> and  doctors  usually  have  three  to  six  minutes  for  the  patients <period> but  now  this  will  change <period> they  go  to  the  clinics <comma> because  they  want  to  cure  their  immediate  symptoms <comma> and  they  will  find  somebody  to  talk  to  and  discuss  these  issues  and  talk  about  what  is  burdening  them  and  find  solutions <comma> develop  their  resources <comma> learn  tools  to  solve  their  family  conflicts  and  gain  some  confidence  in  the  future <period> and  i  would  like  to  share  one  short  vignette <period> one  hazara  said  to  his  pashtun  counselor <comma> if  we  were  to  have  met  some  years  ago <comma> then  we  would  have  killed  each  other <period> and  now  you  are  helping  me  to  regain  some  confidence  in  the  future <period> and  another  counselor  said  to  me  after  the  training <comma> you  know <comma> i  never  knew  why  i  survived  the  killings  in  my  village <period> but  now  i  know <comma> because  i  am  part  of  a  nucleus  of  a  new  peaceful  society  in  afghanistan <period> so  i  believe  this  kept  me  running <period> and  this  is  a  really  emancipatory  and  political  contribution  to  peace  and  reconciliation <period> and  also <comma> i  think <comma> without  psycho-social  therapy <comma> and  without  considering  this  in  all  humanitarian  projects <comma> we  cannot  build-up  civil  societies <period> i  thought  it  was  an  idea  worth  spreading <comma> and  i  think  it  must  be <comma> can  be <comma> could  be  replicated  elsewhere <period> i  thank  you  for  your  attention <period> well <comma> good  morning  ladies  and  gentlemen <period> my  name  is  art  benjamin <comma> and  i  am  a  mathemagician <period> what  that  means  is <comma> i  combine  my  loves  of  math  and  magic  to  do  something  i  call  mathemagics <period> but  before  i  get  started <comma> i  have  a  quick  question  for  the  audience <period> by  any  chance <comma> did  anyone  happen  to  bring  with  them  this  morning  a  calculator <questionmark> seriously <comma> if  you  have  a  calculator  with  you <comma> raise  your  hand <comma> raise  your  hand <period> i <comma> was <comma> your  hand  go  up <questionmark> now  bring  it  out <comma> bring  it  out <period> anybody  else <questionmark> i  see <comma> i  see  one  way  in  the  back <period> you  sir <comma> that  's  three <period> and  anybody  on  this  side  here <questionmark> ok <comma> you  over  there  on  the  aisle <period> would  the  four  of  you  with  calculators  please  bring  out  your  calculators <comma> then  join  me  up  on  stage <period> and  let  's  give  these  volunteers  a  nice  round  of  applause <period> that  's  right <period> now <comma> since  i  have  n't  had  the  chance  to  work  with  these  calculators <comma> i  need  to  make  sure  that  they  are  all  working  properly <period> would  somebody  get  us  started  by  giving  us  a  two-digit  number  please <questionmark> how  about  a  two-digit  number <questionmark> audience <comma> 22 <period> arthur  benjamin <comma> 22 <period> and  another  two-digit  number <comma> sir <questionmark> audience <comma> 47 <period> ab <comma> multiply  22  times  47 <comma> make  sure  you  get  1,034 <comma> or  the  calculators  are  not  working <period> do  all  of  you  get  1,034 <questionmark> 1,034 <questionmark> woman <comma> no <period> ab <comma> 594 <period> let  's  give  three  of  them  a  nice  round  of  applause  there <period> would  you  like  to  try  a  more  standard  calculator <comma> just  in  case <questionmark> ok <comma> great <period> what  i  'm  going  to  try  and  do  then <comma> i  notice  that  took  some  of  you  a  little  bit  of  time  to  get  your  answer <period> that  's  ok <period> i  'll  give  you  a  shortcut  for  multiplying  even  faster  on  the  calculator <period> there  is  something  called  the  square  of  a  number <comma> which  most  of  you  know  is  taking  a  number  and  multiplying  it  by  itself <period> for  instance <comma> five  squared  would  be <questionmark> audience <comma> 25 <period> ab <comma> 25 <period> now <comma> the  way  we  can  square  on  most  calculators <comma> let  me  demonstrate  with  this  one <comma> is  by  taking  the  number <comma> such  as  five <comma> hitting  times  and  then  equals <comma> and  on  most  calculators  that  will  give  you  the  square <period> on  some  of  these  ancient  rpn  calculators <comma> you've  got  an  x  squared  button  on  it <comma> will  allow  you  to  do  the  calculation  even  faster <period> what  i  'm  going  to  try  and  do  now  is  to  square <comma> in  my  head <comma> four  two-digit  numbers  faster  than  they  can  do  on  their  calculators <comma> even  using  the  shortcut  method <period> what  i  'll  use  is  the  second  row  this  time <comma> and  i  'll  get  four  of  you <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <comma> to  each  yell  out  a  two-digit  number <comma> and  if  you  would  square  the  first  number <comma> and  if  you  would  square  the  second <comma> the  third  and  the  fourth <comma> i  will  try  and  race  you  to  the  answer <period> ok <questionmark> so  quickly <comma> a  two-digit  number  please <period> audience <comma> 37 <period> ab <comma> 37  squared <comma> ok <period> audience <comma> 23 <period> ab <comma> 23  squared <comma> ok <period> audience <comma> 59 <period> ab <comma> 59  squared <comma> ok <comma> and  finally <questionmark> audience <comma> 93 <period> ab <comma> 93  squared <period> would  you  call  out  your  answers <comma> please <questionmark> woman <comma> 1369 <period> ab <comma> 1369 <period> woman <comma> 529 <period> ab <comma> 529 <period> man <comma> 3481 <period> ab <comma> 3481 <period> man <comma> 8649 <period> ab <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> let  me  try  to  take  this  one  step  further <period> i  'm  going  to  try  to  square  some  three-digit  numbers  this  time <period> i  wo  n't  even  write  these  down <comma> i  'll  just  call  them  out  as  they  're  called  out  to  me <period> anyone  i  point  to <comma> call  out  a  three-digit  number <period> anyone  on  our  panel <comma> verify  the  answer <period> just  give  some  indication  if  it  's  right <period> a  three-digit  number <comma> sir <comma> yes <questionmark> audience <comma> 987 <period> ab <comma> 987  squared  is  974,169 <period> yes <questionmark> good <period> another <comma> another  three-digit <comma> another  three-digit  number <comma> sir <questionmark> audience <comma> 457 <period> ab <comma> 457  squared  is  205,849 <period> 205,849 <questionmark> yes <questionmark> ok <comma> another <comma> another  three-digit  number <comma> sir <questionmark> audience <comma> 321 <period> ab <comma> 321  is  103,041 <period> 103,041 <period> yes <questionmark> one  more  three-digit  number  please <period> audience <comma> oh <comma> 722 <period> ab <comma> 722  is  500 <comma> ooh <comma> that  's  a  harder  one <period> is  that  513,284 <questionmark> woman <comma> yes <period> ab <comma> yes <questionmark> oh <comma> one  more <comma> one  more  three-digit  number  please <period> audience <comma> 162 <period> 162  squared  is  26,244 <period> thank  you  very  much <period> let  me  try  to  take  this  one  step  further <period> i  'm  going  to  try  to  square  a  four-digit  number  this  time <period> now  you  can  all  take  your  time  on  this <period> i  will  not  beat  you  to  the  answer  on  this  one <comma> but  i  will  try  to  get  the  answer  right <period> to  make  this  a  little  bit  more  random <comma> let  's  take  the  fourth  row  this  time <comma> let  's  say <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <period> if  each  of  you  would  call  out  a  single  digit  between  zero  and  nine <comma> that  will  be  the  four-digit  number  that  i  'll  square <period> audience <comma> nine <period> ab <comma> nine <period> audience <comma> seven <period> ab <comma> seven <period> audience <comma> five <period> ab <comma> five <period> audience <comma> eight <period> ab <comma> eight <period> 9,758 <comma> this  will  take  me  a  little  bit  of  time <comma> so  bear  with  me <period> 95,218,564 <questionmark> woman <comma> yes <period> ab <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> now <comma> i  would  attempt  to  square  a  five-digit  number <comma> and  i  can <comma> but  unfortunately  most  calculators  cannot <period> eight-digit  capacity <comma> do  n't  you  hate  that <questionmark> so <comma> since  we've  reached  the  limits  of  our  calculators <comma> what  's  that <questionmark> does  yours  go <comma> woman <comma> i  do  n't  know <period> ab <comma> does  yours  go  higher <questionmark> oh <comma> yours  does <questionmark> man <comma> i  can  probably  do  it <period> ab <comma> i  'll  talk  to  you  later <period> in  the  meanwhile <comma> let  me  conclude  the  first  part  of  my  show  by  doing  something  a  little  trickier <period> let  's  take  the  largest  number  on  the  board  here <comma> 8649 <period> would  you  each  enter  that  on  your  calculator <questionmark> and  instead  of  squaring  it  this  time <comma> i  want  you  to  take  that  number  and  multiply  it  by  any  three-digit  number  that  you  want <comma> but  do  n't  tell  me  what  you  're  multiplying  by <comma> just  multiply  it  by  any  random  three-digit  number <period> so  you  should  have  as  an  answer  either  a  six-digit  or  probably  a  seven-digit  number <period> how  many  digits  do  you  have <comma> six  or  seven <questionmark> seven <comma> and  yours <questionmark> woman <comma> seven <period> ab <comma> seven <questionmark> seven <questionmark> and <comma> uncertain <period> man <comma> yeah <period> ab <comma> seven <period> is  there  any  possible  way  that  i  could  know  what  seven  digit  numbers  you  have <questionmark> say  no <period> good <period> then  i  shall  attempt  the  impossible <comma> or  at  least  the  improbable <period> what  i'd  like  each  of  you  to  do  is  to  call  out  for  me  any  six  of  your  seven  digits <comma> any  six  of  them <comma> in  any  order  you'd  like <period> one  digit  at  a  time <comma> i  shall  try  and  determine  the  digit  you've  left  out <period> so <comma> starting  with  your  seven-digit  number <comma> call  out  any  six  of  them  please <period> woman <comma> one <comma> ok <comma> 197042 <period> ab <comma> did  you  leave  out  the  number  6 <questionmark> woman <comma> yes <comma> ab <comma> good <comma> ok <comma> that  's  one <period> you  have  a  seven-digit  number <comma> call  out  any  six  of  them  please <period> woman <comma> 44875 <period> ab <comma> i  think  i  only  heard  five  numbers <period> i <comma> wait <comma> 44875 <comma> did  you  leave  out  the  number  6 <questionmark> woman <comma> yes <period> ab <comma> same  as  she  did <comma> ok <period> you've  got  a  seven-digit  number <comma> call  out  any  six  of  them  loud  and  clear <period> man <comma> 079044 <period> ab <comma> i  think  you  left  out  the  number  3 <questionmark> that  's  three <period> the  odds  of  me  getting  all  four  of  these  right  by  random  guessing  would  be  one  in  10,000 <comma> 10  to  the  fourth  power <period> ok <comma> any  six  of  them <period> really  scramble  them  up  this  time <comma> please <period> man <comma> 263972 <period> ab <comma> did  you  leave  out  the  number  7 <questionmark> and  let  's  give  all  four  of  these  people  a  nice  round  of  applause <period> thank  you  very  much <period> for  my  next  number <comma> while  i  mentally  recharge  my  batteries <comma> i  have  one  more  question  for  the  audience <period> by  any  chance <comma> does  anybody  here  happen  to  know  the  day  of  the  week  that  they  were  born  on <questionmark> if  you  think  you  know  your  birth  day <comma> raise  your  hand <period> let  's  see <comma> starting  with <comma> let  's  start  with  a  gentleman  first <period> ok  sir <comma> what  year  was  it <comma> first  of  all <questionmark> that  's  why  i  start  with  a  gentleman  first <period> what  year <questionmark> audience <comma> 1953 <period> ab <comma> 1953 <comma> and  the  month <questionmark> audience <comma> november <period> ab <comma> november  what <questionmark> audience <comma> 23rd <period> ab <comma> 23rd <comma> was  that  a  monday <questionmark> audience <comma> yes <period> yes <comma> good <period> somebody  else <questionmark> who  else  would  like <comma> see  i  do  n't <comma> have  n't  seen  any  women  's  hands  up <period> ok <comma> it  's <comma> how  about  you <comma> what  year <questionmark> audience <comma> 1949 <period> ab <comma> 1949 <comma> and  the  month <questionmark> audience <comma> october <period> ab <comma> october  what <questionmark> audience <comma> fifth <period> ab <comma> fifth <comma> was  that  a  wednesday <questionmark> yes

that  be  a  wednesday <questionmark> audience <comma> yes <period> ab <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> anybody  here  who'd  like  to  know  the  day  of  the  week  they  were  born <questionmark> we  can  do  it  that  way <period> of  course <comma> i  could  just  make  up  an  answer  and  you  would  n't  know <comma> so  i  come  prepared  for  that <period> i  brought  with  me  a  book  of  calendars <period> it  goes  as  far  back  into  the  past  as  1800 <comma> cause  you  never  know <period> i  did  n't  mean  to  look  at  you <comma> sir <comma> you  were  just  sitting  there <period> anyway <comma> chris <comma> you  can  help  me  out  here <comma> if  you  would  n't  mind <period> this  is  a  book  of  calendars <comma> and  i  'll  ask <comma> who  was  it  that  wanted  to  know  their  birth  day <questionmark> you  sir <questionmark> ok <period> what  year  was  it <comma> first  of  all <questionmark> audience <comma> 1966 <period> ab <comma> 66 <comma> turn  to  the  calendar  with  1966 <comma> and  what  month <questionmark> audience <comma> april <period> ab <comma> april  what <questionmark> audience <comma> 17th <period> ab <comma> 17th <comma> i  believe  that  was  a  sunday <period> can  you  confirm <comma> chris <questionmark> chris  anderson <comma> yes <period> ab <comma> yeah <comma> ok <period> i  'll  tell  you  what <comma> chris <comma> as  long  as  you  have  that  book  in  front  of  you <comma> do  me  a  favor <comma> turn  to  a  year  outside  of  the  1900s <period> either  into  the  1800s  or  way  into  the  2000s <comma> that  'll  be  a  much  greater  challenge  for  me <period> what  year <comma> chris <comma> would  you  like <questionmark> ca <comma> 1824 <period> ab <comma> 1824 <comma> ok <period> and  what  month <questionmark> ca <comma> june <period> ab <comma> june  what <questionmark> ca <comma> sixth <period> ab <comma> sixth <comma> was  that  a  sunday <questionmark> ca <comma> it  was <period> ab <comma> and  it  was  cloudy <period> good <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> but  i'd  like  to  wrap  things  up  now  by  alluding  to  something  from  earlier  in  the  presentation <period> there  was  a  gentleman  up  here  who  had  a  10-digit  calculator <period> where  is  he <comma> would  you  stand  up <comma> 10-digit  guy <questionmark> ok <comma> well  stand  up  for  me  just  for  a  second <comma> so  i  can  see  where  you  are <period> ok <comma> oh <comma> ok <comma> you  have  a  10-digit  calculator <comma> sir <comma> as  well <questionmark> ok <comma> what  i  'm  going  to  try  and  do <comma> is  to  square  in  my  head  a  five-digit  number  requiring  a  10-digit  calculator <period> but  to  make  my  job  more  interesting  for  you <comma> as  well  as  for  me <comma> i  'm  going  to  do  this  problem  thinking  out  loud <period> so  you  can  actually <comma> honestly  hear  what  's  going  on  in  my  mind  while  i  do  a  calculation  of  this  size <period> now <comma> i  have  to  apologize  to  our  magician  friend  lennart  green <period> i  know  as  a  magician  we  're  not  supposed  to  reveal  our  secrets <comma> but  i  'm  not  too  afraid  that  people  are  going  to  start  doing  my  show  next  week <comma> so <comma> i  think  we  're  ok <period> so <comma> let  's  see <comma> let  's  take  a <comma> let  's  take  a  different  row  of  people <comma> starting  with  you <period> i  'll  get  five  digits <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <comma> oh <comma> i  did  this  row  already <period> let  's  do  the  row  before  you <comma> starting  with  you  sir <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <comma> five <period> call  out  a  single  digit <comma> that  will  be  the  five-digit  number  that  i  will  try  to  square <period> go  ahead <period> audience <comma> five <period> ab <comma> five <period> audience <comma> seven <period> ab <comma> seven <period> audience <comma> six <period> ab <comma> six <period> audience <comma> eight <period> ab <comma> eight <period> audience <comma> three <period> ab <comma> three <period> 57,683  squared <period> yuck <period> let  me  explain  to  you  how  i  'm  going  to  attempt  this  problem <period> i  'm  going  to  break  the  problem  down  into  three  parts <period> i  'll  do  57,000  squared <comma> plus  683  squared <comma> plus  57,000  times  683  times  two <period> add  all  those  numbers  together <comma> and  with  any  luck <comma> arrive  at  the  answer <period> now <comma> let  me  recap <period> thank  you <period> while  i  explain  something  else <comma> i  know <comma> that  you  can  use <comma> right <questionmark> while  i  do  these  calculations <comma> you  might  hear  certain  words <comma> as  opposed  to  numbers <comma> creep  into  the  calculation <period> let  me  explain  what  that  is <period> this  is  a  phonetic  code <comma> a  mnemonic  device  that  i  use <comma> that  allows  me  to  convert  numbers  into  words <period> i  store  them  as  words <comma> and  later  on  retrieve  them  as  numbers <period> i  know  it  sounds  complicated <period> it  's  not <comma> i  just  do  n't  want  you  to  think  you  're  seeing  something  out  of  rain  man  here <period> there  's  definitely  a  method  to  my  madness <comma> definitely <comma> definitely <period> sorry <period> if  you  want  to  talk  to  me  about  adhd  afterwards <comma> you  can  talk  to  me  then <period> all  right <comma> by  the  way <comma> one  last  instruction <comma> for  my  judges  with  the  calculators <comma> ok <comma> you  know  who  you  are <comma> there  is  at  least  a  50  percent  chance  that  i  will  make  a  mistake  here <period> if  i  do <comma> do  n't  tell  me  what  the  mistake  is <period> just  say <comma> you  're  close <comma> or  something  like  that <comma> and  i  'll  try  and  figure  out  the  answer <comma> which  could  be  pretty  entertaining  in  itself <period> if <comma> however <comma> i  am  right <comma> whatever  you  do <comma> do  n't  keep  it  to  yourself <comma> ok <questionmark> make  sure  everybody  knows  that  i  got  the  answer  right <comma> because  this  is  my  big  finish <comma> ok <period> so <comma> without  any  more  stalling <comma> here  we  go <period> i  'll  start  the  problem  in  the  middle <comma> with  57  times  683 <period> now <comma> 57  times  68  is  3,400 <comma> plus  476  is  3876 <comma> that  's  38,760  plus  171 <comma> 38,760  plus  171  is  38,931 <period> 38,931 <period> double  that  to  get  77,862 <period> 77,862  becomes  cookie  fission <comma> cookie  fission  is  77,822 <period> that  seems  right <comma> i  'll  go  on <period> cookie  fission <comma> ok <period> next <comma> i  do  57  squared <comma> which  is  3,249 <comma> so  i  can  say <comma> three  billion <period> take  the  249 <comma> add  that  to  cookie <comma> 249 <comma> oops <comma> but  i  see  a  carry  coming <comma> 249 <comma> add  that  to  cookie <comma> 250  plus  77 <comma> is  327  million <comma> fission <comma> fission <comma> ok <comma> finally <comma> we  do  683  squared <comma> that  's  700  times  666 <comma> plus  17  squared  is  466,489 <comma> rev  up  if  i  need  it <comma> rev  up <comma> take  the  466 <comma> add  that  to  fission <comma> to  get <comma> oh  gee <comma> 328,489 <period> audience <comma> yeah <period> ab <comma> good <period> thank  you  very  much <period> i  hope  you  enjoyed  mathemagics <period> thank  you <period> four  years  ago <comma> on  the  ted  stage <comma> i  announced  a  company  i  was  working  with  at  the  time  called  odeo <period> and  because  of  that  announcement <comma> we  got  a  big  article  in  the  new  york  times <comma> which  led  to  more  press <comma> which  led  to  more  attention <comma> and  me  deciding  to  become  ceo  of  that  company <comma> whereas  i  was  just  an  adviser <comma> and  raising  a  round  of  venture  capital  and  ramping  up  hiring <period> one  of  the  guys  i  hired  was  an  engineer  named  jack  dorsey <comma> and  a  year  later  we  were  trying  to  decide  which  way  to  go  with  odeo <comma> and  jack  presented  an  idea  he'd  been  tinkering  around  with  for  a  number  of  years  that  was  based  around  sending  simple  status  updates  to  friends <period> we  were  also  playing  with  sms  at  the  time  at  odeo <comma> so  we  kind  of  put  two  and  two  together <comma> and  in  early  2006  we  launched  twitter  as  a  side  project  at  odeo <period> now <comma> it  's  hard  to  justify  doing  a  side  project  at  a  startup <comma> where  focus  is  so  critical <comma> but  i  had  actually  launched  blogger  as  a  side  project  to  my  previous  company <comma> thinking  it  was  just  a  little  thing  we'd  do  on  the  side <comma> and  it  ended  up  taking  over  not  only  the  company <comma> but  my  life  over  the  next  five  or  six  years <period> so  i  learned  to  follow  hunches  even  though  you  cannot  necessarily  justify  them  or  know  where  they  're  going  to  go <period> and  that  's  kind  of  what  's  happened  with  twitter <comma> time  after  time <period> so <comma> for  those  of  you  unfamiliar <comma> twitter  is  based  around  a  very  simple <comma> seemingly  trivial  concept <period> you  say  what  you  're  doing  in  140  characters  or  less <comma> and  people  who  are  interested  in  you  get  those  updates <period> if  they  're  really  interested <comma> they  get  the  update  as  a  text  message  on  their  cell  phone <period> so <comma> for  instance <comma> i  may  twitter  right  now  that  i  'm  giving  a  talk  at  ted <period> it  's  a  normal  everyday  thing <period> and  in  my  case <comma> when  i  hit  send <comma> up  to  60,000  people  will  receive  that  message  in  a  matter  of  seconds <period> now <comma> the  fundamental  idea  is  that  twitter  lets  people  share  moments  of  their  lives  whenever  they  want <comma> be  they  momentous  occasions  or  mundane  ones <period> it  is  by  sharing  these  moments  as  they  're  happening  that  lets  people  feel  more  connected  and  in  touch <comma> despite  distance <comma> and  in  real  time <period> this  was  the  primary  use  we  saw  for  twitter  from  the  beginning <comma> and  what  got  us  excited <period> what  we  did  n't  anticipate  was  the  many <comma> many  other  uses  that  would  evolve  from  this  very  simple  system <period> one  of  the  things  we  realized  was  how  important  twitter  could  be  during  real-time  events <period> when  the  wildfires  broke  out  in  san  diego <comma> in  october  of  2007 <comma> people  turned  to  twitter  to  report  what  was  happening  and  to  find  information  from  neighbors  about  what  was  happening  around  them <period> but  it  was  n't  just  individuals <period> the  la <period> times  actually  turned  to  twitter  to  dispense  information  as  well <comma> and  put  a  twitter  feed  on  the  front  page <comma> and  the  la <period> fire  department  and  red  cross  used  it  to  dispense  news  and  updates  as  well <period> at  this  event <comma> dozens  of  people  are  twittering  and  thousands  of  people  are  following  along  because  they  want  to  know  what  it  feels  like  to  be  here  and  what  's  happening <period> among  the  other  interesting  things  that  have  cropped  up  are  many  things  from  businesses <comma> from  marketing  and  communications  and  predictable  things <comma> to  an  insanely  popular  korean-barbecue  taco  truck  that  drives  around  la <period> and  twitters  where  it  stops <comma> causing  a  line  to  form  around  the  block <period> politicians  have  recently  begun  twittering <period> in  fact <comma> there  are  47  members  of  congress  who  currently  have  twitter  accounts <period> and  they  're  tweeting <comma> in  some  cases <comma> from  behind  closed-door  sessions  with  the  president <period> in  this  case <comma> this  guy  's  not  liking  what  he  's  hearing <period> the  president  himself  is  our  most  popular  twitter  user <comma> although  his  tweets  have  dropped  off  as  of  late <comma> while  senator  mccain  's  have  picked  up <period> as  have  this  guy  's <period> twitter  was  originally  designed  as  a  broadcast  medium: <period> you  send  one  message  and  it  goes  out  to  everybody <comma> and  you  receive  the  messages  you  're  interested  in <period> one  of  the  many  ways  that  users  shaped  the  evolution  of  twitter  was  by  inventing  a  way  to  reply  to  a  specific  person  or  a  specific  message <period> so <comma> this  syntax <comma> the  @username  that  shaquille  o'neal  's  using  here  to  reply  to  one  of  his  fans <comma> was  completely  invented  by  users <comma> and  we  did  n't  build  it  into  the  system  until  it  already  became  popular  and  then  we  made  it  easier <period> this  is  one  of  the  many  ways  that  users  have  shaped  the  system <period> another  is  via  the  api <period> we  built  an  application-programming  interface <comma> which  basically  means  that  programmers  can  write  software  that  interacts  with  twitter <period> we  currently  know  about  over  2,000  pieces  of  software  that  can  send  twitter  updates <comma> interfaces  for  mac <comma> windows <comma> your  iphone <comma> your  blackberry  -- <period> as  well  as  things  like  a  device  that  lets  an  unborn  baby  twitter  when  it  kicks  or  a  plant  twitter  when  it  needs  water <period> probably  the  most  important  third-party  development  came  from  a  little  company  in  virginia  called  summize <period> summize  built  a  twitter  search  engine <period> and  they  tapped  into  the  fact  that <comma> if  you  have  millions  of  people  around  the  world  talking  about  what  they  're  doing  and  what  's  around  them <comma> you  have  an  incredible  resource  to  find  out  about  any  topic  or  event  while  it  's  going  on <period> this  really  changed  how  we  perceived  twitter <period> for  instance <comma> here  's  what  people  are  saying  about  ted <period> this  is  another  way  that  our  mind  was  shifted <comma> and  twitter  was  n't  what  we  thought  it  was <period> we  liked  this  so  much  we  actually  bought  the  company  and  are  folding  it  into  the  main  product <period> this  not  only  lets  you  view  twitters  in  different  ways <comma> but  it  introduces  new  use  cases  as  well <period> one  of  my  favorites  is  what  happened  a  few  months  ago  when  there  was  a  gas  shortage  in  atlanta <period> some  users  figured  out  that  they  would  twitter  when  they  found  gas <comma> where  it  was <comma> and  how  much  it  cost <comma> and  then  appended  the  keyword  #atlgas  so  that  other  people  search  for  that  and  find  gas  themselves <period> and  this  trend  of  people  using  this  communication  network  to  help  each  other  out  goes  far  beyond  the  original  idea  of  just  keeping  up  with  family  and  friends <period> it  's  happened  more  and  more  lately <comma> whether  it  's  raising  money  for  homeless  people  or  to  dig  wells  in  africa  or  for  a  family  in  crisis <period> people  have  raised  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  over  twitter  in  a  matter  of  days  on  several  occasions <period> it  seems  like  when  you  give  people  easier  ways  to  share  information <comma> more  good  things  happen <period> i  have  no  idea  what  will  happen  next  with  twitter <period> i've  learned  to  follow  the  hunch <comma> but  never  assume  where  it  will  go <period> thanks <period> chris  anderson <comma> we  're  not  quite  done  yet <period> so <comma> look <comma> if  we  could  have  this  screen  live <period> this  is  actually  the  most  terrifying  thing  that  any  speaker  can  do  after  they've  been  to  an  event <period> it  's  totally  intimidating <period> so <comma> this  would  be  the  twitter  search  screen <period> let  's  type  a  couple  of  random  words  into  twitter <period> for  example <comma> evan  williams <period> give  people  more  information  and  follow  your  hunch  @  #ted <period> currently  listening  to  evan  williams <period> oh <period> evan  williams  is  just  dying  on  stage  here  at  ted <period> worst  talk  ever  evan  williams <comma> nice <period> thanks <period> ca <comma> just  kidding <period> but <comma> literally  in  the  eight  minutes  he  was  talking <comma> there  are  about  fifty  tweets  that  already  came  on  the  talk <period> so  he  'll  see  every  aspect  of  the  reaction <comma> the  fact  that  barack  obama  is  the  biggest  twitterer <comma> the  fact  that  it  came  out  of  ted <period> i  do  n't  think  there  's  any  other  way  of  getting  instant  feedback  that  way <period> you  have  build  something  very  fascinating <comma> and  it  looks  like  its  best  times  are  still  ahead  of  it <period> so <comma> thank  you  very  much <comma> evan <period> that  was  very  interesting <period> ew <comma> thank  you <period> well <comma> first  of  all <comma> let  me  thank  emeka <comma> as  a  matter  of  fact <comma> ted  global <comma> for  putting  this  conference  together <period> this  conference  is  going  to  rank  as  the  most  important  in  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century <period> think  african  governments  will  put  together  a  conference  like  this <questionmark> you  think  the  au <period> will  put  together  a  conference  like  this <questionmark> even  before  they  do  that  they  will  ask  for  foreign  aid <period> i  would  also  like  to  pay  homage  and  honor  to  the  ted  fellows  june  arunga <comma> james  shikwati <comma> andrew <comma> and  the  other  ted  fellows <period> i  call  them  the  cheetah  generation <period> the  cheetah  generation  is  a  new  breed  of  africans  who  brook  no  nonsense  about  corruption <period> they  understand  what  accountability  and  democracy  is <period> they  're  not  going  to  wait  for  government  to  do  things  for  them <period> that  's  the  cheetah  generation <period> and  africa  's  salvation  rests  on  the  backs  of  these  cheetahs <period> in  contrast <comma> of  course <comma> we  have  the  hippo  generation <period> the  hippo  generation  are  the  ruling  elites <period> they  are  stuck  in  their  intellectual  patch <period> complaining  about  colonialism  and  imperialism <comma> they  would  n't  move  one  foot <period> if  you  ask  them  to  reform  the  economies <comma> they  're  not  going  to  reform  it  because  they  benefit  from  the  rotten  status  quo <period> now <comma> there  are  a  lot  of  africans  who  are  very  angry <comma> angry  at  the  condition  of  africa <period> now <comma> we  're  talking  about  a  continent  that  is  not  poor <period> it  is  rich  in  mineral  resources <comma> natural  mineral  resources <period> but  the  mineral  wealth  of  africa  is  not  being  utilized  to  lift  its  people  out  of  poverty <period> that  's  what  makes  a  lot  of  africans  very  angry <period> and  in  a  way <comma> africa  is  more  than  a  tragedy <comma> in  more  ways  than  one <period> there  's  another  enduring  tragedy <comma> and  that  tragedy  is  that  there  are  so  many  people <comma> so  many  governments <comma> so  many  organizations  who  want  to  help  the  people  in  africa <period> they  do  n't  understand <period> now <comma> we  're  not  saying  do  n't  help  africa <period> helping  africa  is  noble <period> but  helping  africa  has  been  turned  into  a  theater  of  the  absurd <period> it  's  like  the  blind  leading  the  clueless <period> there  are  certain  things  that  we  need  to  recognize <period> africa  's  begging-bowl  leaks <period> did  you  know  that  40  percent  of  the  wealth  created  in  africa  is  not  invested  here  in  africa <questionmark> it  's  taken  out  of  africa <period> that  's  what  the  world  bank  says <period> look  at  africa  's  begging-bowl <period> it  leaks  horribly <period> there  are  people  who  think  that  we  should  pour  more  money <comma> more  aid  into  this  bowl  which  leaks <period> what  are  the  leakages <questionmark> corruption  alone  costs  africa  148  billion  dollars  a  year <period> yes <comma> put  that  aside <period> capital  flight  out  of  africa <comma> 80  billion  a  year <period> put  that  aside <period> let  's  take  food  imports <period> every  year  africa  spends  20  billion  dollars  to  import  food <period> just  add  that  up <comma> all  these  leakages <period> that  's  far  more  than  the  50  billion  tony  blair  wants  to  raise  for  africa <period> now <comma> back  in  the  1960s  africa  not  only  fed  itself <comma> it  also  exported  food <period> not  anymore <period> we  know  that  something  has  gone  fundamentally  wrong <period> you  know  it <comma> i  know  it <comma> but  let  's  not  waste  our  time  talking  about  these  mistakes  because  we  'll  spend  all  day  here <period> let  's  move  on <comma> and  flip  over  to  the  next  chapter <period> and  that  's  what  this  conference  is  all  about <comma> the  next  chapter <period> the  next  chapter  begins  with  first  of  all <comma> asking  ourselves  this  fundamental  question <comma> whom  do  we  want  to  help  in  africa <questionmark> there  is  the  people <comma> and  then  there  is  the  government  or  leaders <period> now <comma> the  previous  speaker  before  me <comma> idris  mohammed <comma> indicated  that  we've  had  abysmal  leadership  in  africa <period> that  characterization <comma> in  my  view <comma> is  even  more  charitable <period> i  belong  to  an  internet  discussion  forum <comma> an  african  internet  discussion  forum <comma> and  i  asked  them <comma> i  said <comma> since  1960 <comma> we've  had  exactly  204  african  heads  of  state <comma> since  1960 <period> and  i  asked  them  to  name  me  just  20  good  leaders <comma> just  20  good  leaders <comma> you  may  want  to  take  this  leadership  challenge  yourself <period> i  asked  them  to  name  me  just  20 <period> everybody  mentioned  nelson  mandela <comma> of  course <period> kwame  nkrumah <comma> nyerere <comma> kenyatta <comma> somebody  mentioned  idi  amin <period> i  let  that  pass <period> my  point  is <comma> they  could  n't  go  beyond  15 <period> even  if  they  had  been  able  to  name  me  20 <comma> what  does  that  tell  you <questionmark> 20  out  of  204  means  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  african  leaders  failed  their  people <period> and  if  you  look  at  them <comma> the  slate  of  the  post-colonial  leaders <comma> an  assortment  of  military  fufu  heads <period> swiss-bank  socialists <comma> crocodile  liberators <comma> vampire  elites <comma> quack  revolutionaries <period> now <comma> this  leadership  is  a  far  cry  from  the  traditional  leaders  that  africans  have  known  for  centuries <period> the  second  false  premise  that  we  make  when  we  're  trying  to  help  africa  is  that  sometimes  we  think  that  there  is  something  called  a  government  in  africa  that  cares  about  its  people <comma> serves  the  interests  of  the  people <comma> and  represents  the  people <period> there  is  one  particular  quote <comma> a  lesotho  chief  once  said  that  here  in  lesotho <comma> we've  got  two  problems <comma> rats  and  the  government <period> what  you  and  i  understand  as  a  government  does  n't  exist  in  many  african  countries <period> in  fact <comma> what  we  call  our  governments  are  vampire  states <period> vampires  because  they  suck  the  economic  vitality  out  of  their  people <period> government  is  the  problem  in  africa <period> a  vampire  state  is  the  government <comma> which  has  been  hijacked  by  a  phalanx  of  bandits  and  crooks  who  use  the  instruments  of  state  power  to  enrich  themselves <comma> their  cronies <comma> and  tribesmen  and  exclude  everybody  else <period> the  richest  people  in  africa  are  heads-of-state  and  ministers <comma> and  quite  often  the  chief  bandit  is  the  head-of-state  himself <period> where  do  they  get  their  money <questionmark> by  creating  wealth <questionmark> no <period> by  raking  it  off  the  backs  of  their  suffering  people <period> that  's  not  wealth  creation <period> it  's  wealth  redistribution <period> the  third  fundamental  issue  that  we  have  to  recognize  is  that  if  we  want  to  help  the  african  people <comma> we  must  know  where  the  african  people  are <period> take  any  african  economy <period> an  african  economy  can  be  broken  up  into  three  sectors <period> there  is  the  modern  sector <comma> there  is  the  informal  sector  and  the  traditional  sector <period> the  modern  sector  is  the  abode  of  the  elites <period> it  's  the  seat  of  government <period> in  many  african  countries  the  modern  sector  is  lost <period> it  's  dysfunctional <period> it  is  a  meretricious  fandango  of  imported  systems <comma> which  the  elites  themselves  do  n't  understand <period> that  is  the  source  of  many  of  africa  's  problems  where  the  struggles  for  political  power  emanate  and  then  spill  over  onto  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sector <comma> claiming  innocent  lives <period> now  the  modern  sector <comma> of  course <comma> is  where  a  lot  of  the  development  aid  and  resources  went  into <period> more  than  80  percent  of  ivory  coast  's  development  went  into  the  modern  sector <period> the  other  sectors <comma> the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors <comma> are  where  you  find  the  majority  of  the  african  people <period> the  real  people  in  africa <period> that  's  where  you  find  them <period> now <comma> obviously  it  makes  common  sense  that  if  you  want  to  help  the  people <comma> you  go  where  the  people  are <period> but  that  's  not  what  we  did <period> as  a  matter  of  fact <comma> we  neglected  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors <period> now <comma> traditional  sector  is  where  africa  produces  its  agriculture <comma> which  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  africa  cannot  feed  itself <comma> and  that  's  why  it  must  import  food <period> all  right <comma> you  cannot  develop  africa  by  ignoring  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors <period> and  you  cannot  develop  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors  without  an  operational  understanding  of  how  these  two  sectors  work <period> these  two  sectors <comma> let  me  describe  to  you <comma> have  their  own  indigenous  institutions <period> first  one  is  the  political  system <period> traditionally <comma> africans  hate  governments <period> they  hate  tyranny <period> if  you  look  into  their  traditional  systems <comma> africans  organize  their  states  in  two  types <period> the  first  one  belongs  to  those  ethnic  societies  who  believe  that  the  state  was  necessarily  tyrannous <comma> so  they  did  n't  want  to  have  anything  to  do  with  any  centralized  authority <period> these  societies  are  the  ibo <comma> the  somali <comma> the  kikuyus <comma> for  example <period> they  have  no  chiefs <period> the  other  ethnic  groups <comma> which  did  have  chiefs <comma> made  sure  that  they  surrounded  the  chiefs  with  councils  upon  councils  upon  councils  to  prevent  them  from  abusing  their  power <period> in  ashanti  tradition <comma> for  example <comma> the  chief  cannot  make  any  decision  without  the  concurrence  of  the  council  of  elders <period> without  the  council  the  chief  cannot  pass  any  law <comma> and  if  the  chief  does  n't  govern  according  to  the  will  of  the  people  he  will  be  removed <period> if  not <comma> the  people  will  abandon  the  chief <comma> go  somewhere  else  and  set  up  a  new  settlement <period> and  even  if  you  look  in  ancient  african  empires <comma> they  were  all  organized  around  one  particular  principle <comma> the  confederacy  principle <comma> which  is  characterized  by  a  great  deal  of  devolution  of  authority <comma> decentralization  of  power <period> now <comma> this  is  what  i  have  described  to  you <period> this  is  part  of  africa  's  indigenous  political  heritage <period> now <comma> compare  that  to  the  modern  systems  the  ruling  elites  established  on  africa <period> it  is  a  total  far  cry <period> in  the  economic  system  in  traditional  africa <comma> the  means  of  production  is  privately  owned <period> it  's  owned  by  extended  families <period> you  see <comma> in  the  west <comma> the  basic  economic  and  social  unit  is  the  individual <period> the  american  will  say <comma> i  am  because  i  am <comma> and  i  can  damn  well  do  anything  i  want <comma> anytime <period> the  accent  is  on  the  i <period> in  africa <comma> the  africans  say <comma> i  am <comma> because  we  are <period> the  we  connotes  community <comma> the  extended  family  system <period> the  extended  family  system  pools  its  resources  together <period> they  own  farms <period> they  decide  what  to  do <comma> what  to  produce <period> they  do  n't  take  any  orders  from  their  chiefs <period> they  decide  what  to  do <period> and  when  they  produce  their  crops <comma> they  sell  the  surplus  on  marketplaces <period> when  they  make  a  profit  it  is  theirs  to  keep <comma> not  for  the  chief  to  sequester  it  from  them <period> so <comma> in  a  nutshell <comma> what  we  had  in  traditional  africa  was  a  free-market  system <period> there  were  markets  in  africa  before  the  colonialists  stepped  foot  on  the  continent <period> timbuktu  was  one  great  big  market  town <period> kano <comma> salaga <comma> they  were  all  there <period> even  if  you  go  to  west  africa <comma> you  notice  that  market  activity  in  west  africa  has  always  been  dominated  by  women <period> so <comma> it  's  quite  appropriate  that  this  section  is  called  a  marketplace <period> the  market  is  not  alien  to  africa <period> what  africans  practiced  was  a  different  form  of  capitalism <comma> but  then  after  independence <comma> all  of  a  sudden <comma> markets <comma> capitalism  became  a  western  institution <comma> and  the  leaders  said  africans  were  ready  for  socialism <period> nonsense <period> and  even  then <comma> what  kind  of  socialism  did  they  practice <questionmark> the  socialism  that  they  practiced  was  a  peculiar  form  of  swiss-bank  socialism <comma> which  allowed  the  heads  of  states  and  the  ministers  to  rape  and  plunder  africa  's  treasuries  for  deposit  in  switzerland <period> that  is  not  the  kind  of  system  africans  had  known  for  centuries <period> what  do  we  do  now <questionmark> go  back  to  africa  's  indigenous  institutions <comma> and  this  is  where  we  charge  the  cheetahs  to  go  into  the  informal  sectors <comma> the  traditional  sectors <period> that  's  where  you  find  the  african  people <period> and  i'd  like  to  show  you  a  quick  little  video  about  the  informal  sector <comma> about  the  boat-building  that  i <comma> myself <comma> tried  to  mobilize  africans  in  the  diaspora  to  invest  in <period> could  you  please  show  that <questionmark> the  men  are  going  fishing  in  these  small  boats <period> yes <comma> it  's  an  enterprise <period> this  is  by  a  local  ghanaian  entrepreneur <comma> using  his  own  capital <period> he  's  getting  no  assistance  from  the  government <comma> and  he  's  building  a  second <comma> bigger  boat <period> a  bigger  boat  will  mean  more  fish  will  be  caught  and  landed <period> it  means  that  he  will  be  able  to  employ  more  ghanaians <period> it  also  means  that  he  will  be  able  to  generate  wealth <period> and  then  it  will  have  what  economists  call  external  effects  on  a  local  economy <period> all  that  you  need  to  do <comma> all  that  the  elites  need  to  do <comma> is  to  move  this  operation  into  something  that  is  enclosed  so  that  the  operation  can  be  made  more  efficient <period> now <comma> it  is  not  just  this  informal  sector <period> there  is  also  traditional  medicine <period> 80  percent  of  africans  still  rely  on  traditional  medicine <period> the  modern  healthcare  sector  has  totally  collapsed <period> now <comma> this  is  an  area <comma> i  mean <comma> there  is  a  treasure  trove  of  wealth  in  the  traditional  medicine  area <period> this  is  where  we  need  to  mobilize  africans <comma> in  the  diaspora  especially <comma> to  invest  in  this <period> we  also  need  to  mobilize  africans  in  the  diaspora <comma> not  only  to  go  into  the  traditional  sectors <comma> but  to  go  into  agriculture  and  also  to  instigate  change  from  within <period> we  were  able  to  mobilize  ghanaians  in  the  diaspora  to  instigate  change  in  ghana  and  bring  about  democracy  in  ghana <period> and  i  know  that  with  the  cheetahs <comma> we  can  take  africa  back  one  village  at  a  time <period> thank  you  very  much <period> you  will  understand  nothing  with  my  type  of  english <period> it  's  good  for  you  because  you  can  have  a  break  after  all  these  fantastic  people <period> i  must  tell  you  i  am  like  that <comma> not  very  comfortable <comma> because  usually <comma> in  life <comma> i  think  my  job  is  absolutely  useless <period> i  mean <comma> i  feel  useless <period> now  after  carolyn <comma> and  all  the  other  guys <comma> i  feel  like  shit <period> and  definitively <comma> i  do  n't  know  why  i  am  here <comma> but <comma> you  know  the  nightmare  you  can  have <comma> like  you  are  an  impostor <comma> you  arrive  at  the  opera <comma> and  they  push  you <comma> you  must  sing <period> i  do  n't  know <period> so <comma> so <comma> because  i  have  nothing  to  show <comma> nothing  to  say <comma> we  shall  try  to  speak  about  something  else <period> we  can  start <comma> if  you  want <comma> by  understanding <comma> it  's  just  to  start <comma> it  's  not  interesting <comma> but <comma> how  i  work <period> when  somebody  comes  to  me  and  ask  for  what  i  am  known <comma> i  mean <comma> yes <comma> lemon  squeezer <comma> toilet  brush <comma> toothpick <comma> beautiful  toilet  seats <comma> and  why  not <comma> a  toothbrush <questionmark> i  do  n't  try  to  design  the  toothbrush <period> i  do  n't  try  to  say <comma> oh <comma> that  will  be  a  beautiful  object <comma> or  something  like  that <period> that  does  n't  interest  me <period> because  there  is  different  types  of  design <period> the  one <comma> we  can  call  it  the  cynical  design <comma> that  means  the  design  invented  by  raymond  loewy  in  the  50s <comma> who  said <comma> what  is  ugly  is  a  bad  sale <comma> la  laideur  se  vend  mal <comma> which  is  terrible <period> it  means  the  design  must  be  just  the  weapon  for  marketing <comma> for  producer  to  make  product  more  sexy <comma> like  that <comma> they  sell  more <comma> it  's  shit <comma> it  's  obsolete <comma> it  's  ridiculous <period> i  call  that  the  cynical  design <period> after <comma> there  is  the  narcissistic  design <comma> it  's  a  fantastic  designer  who  designs  only  for  other  fantastic  designers <period> after <comma> there  is  people  like  me <comma> who  try  to  deserve  to  exist <comma> and  who  are  so  ashamed  to  make  this  useless  job <comma> who  try  to  do  it  in  another  way <comma> and  they  try <comma> i  try <comma> to  not  make  the  object  for  the  object  but  for  the  result <comma> for  the  profit  for  the  human  being <comma> the  person  who  will  use  it <period> if  we  take  the  toothbrush <comma> i  do  n't  think  about  the  toothbrush <period> i  think <comma> what  will  be  the  effect  of  the  brush  in  the  mouth <questionmark> and  to  understand  what  will  be  the  effect  of  the  toothbrush  in  the  mouth <comma> i  must  imagine <comma> who  owns  this  mouth <questionmark> what  is  the  life  of  the  owner  of  this  mouth <questionmark> in  what  society  does  this  guy  live <questionmark> what  civilization  creates  this  society <questionmark> what  animal  species  creates  this  civilization <questionmark> when  i  arrive <comma> and  i  take  one  minute <comma> i  am  not  so  intelligent <comma> when  i  arrive  at  the  level  of  animal  species <comma> that  becomes  real  interesting <period> me <comma> i  have  strictly  no  power  to  change  anything <period> but  when  i  come  back <comma> i  can  understand  why  i  shall  not  do  it <comma> because  today  to  not  do  it <comma> it  's  more  positive  than  do  it <comma> or  how  i  shall  do  it <period> but  to  come  back <comma> where  i  am  at  the  animal  species <comma> there  is  things  to  see <period> there  is  things  to  see <comma> there  is  the  big  challenge <period> the  big  challenge  in  front  of  us <period> because  there  is  not  a  human  production  which  exists  outside  of  what  i  call  the  big  image  the  big  image  is  our  story <comma> our  poetry <comma> our  romanticism <period> our  poetry  is  our  mutation <comma> our  life <period> we  must  remember <comma> and  we  can  see  that  in  any  book  of  my  son  of  10  years  old <comma> that  life  appears  four  billion  years  ago <comma> around <comma> four  billion  point  two <questionmark> voice  offstage <comma> four  point  five <period> yes <comma> point  five <comma> ok <comma> ok <comma> ok <period> i  'm  a  designer <comma> that  's  all <comma> of  christmas  gifts <period> and  before <comma> there  was  this  soup <comma> called  soupe  primordiale <comma> this  first  soup <comma> bloop  bloop  bloop <comma> sort  of  dirty  mud <comma> no  life <comma> nothing <period> so  then <comma> pshoo-shoo <comma> lightning <comma> pshoo <comma> arrive <comma> pshoo-shoo <comma> makes  life <comma> bloop  bloop <comma> and  that  dies <period> some  million  years  after <comma> pshoo-shoo <comma> bloop-bloop <comma> ah <comma> wake  up <period> at  the  end <comma> finally <comma> that  succeeds <comma> and  life  appears <period> we  was  so <comma> so  stupid <period> the  most  stupid  bacteria <period> even <comma> i  think <comma> we  copy  our  way  to  reproduce <comma> you  know  what  i  mean <comma> and  something  of <comma> oh  no <comma> forget  it <period> after <comma> we  become  a  fish <period> after <comma> we  become  a  frog <period> after <comma> we  become  a  monkey <period> after <comma> we  become  what  we  are  today <comma> a  super-monkey <comma> and  the  fun  is <comma> the  super-monkey  we  are  today <comma> is  at  half  of  the  story <period> can  you  imagine <questionmark> from  that  stupid  bacteria  to  us <comma> with  a  microphone <comma> with  a  computer <comma> with  an  ipod <comma> four  billion  years <period> and  we  know <comma> and  especially  carolyn  knows <comma> that  when  the  sun  will  implode <comma> the  earth  will  burn <comma> explode <comma> i  do  n't  know  what <comma> and  this  is  scheduled  for  four <comma> four  billion  years <questionmark> yes <comma> she  said <comma> something  like  that <period> ok <comma> that  means  we  are  at  half  of  the  story <period> fantastic <period> it  's  a  beauty <period> can  you  imagine <questionmark> it  's  very  symbolic <period> because  the  bacteria  we  was  had  no  idea  of  what  we  are  today <period> and  today <comma> we  have  no  idea  of  what  we  shall  be  in  four  billion  years <period> and  this  territory  is  fantastic <period> that  is  our  poetry <period> that  is  our  beautiful  story <period> it  's  our  romanticism <period> mu-ta-tion <period> we  are  mutants <period> and  if  we  do  n't  deeply  understand <comma> if  we  do  n't  integrate  that  we  are  mutants <comma> we  completely  miss  the  story <period> because  every  generation  thinks  we  are  the  final  one <period> we  have  a  way  to  look  at  earth  like  that <comma> you  know <comma> i  am  the  man <period> the  final  man <period> you  know <comma> we  mutate  during  four  billion  years  before <comma> but  now <comma> because  it  's  me <comma> we  stop <period> fin <period> for  the  end <comma> for  the  eternity <comma> it  is  one  with  a  red  jacket <period> something  like  that <period> i  am  not  sure  of  that <period> because  that  is  our  intelligence  of  mutation  and  things  like  that <period> there  is  so  many  things  to  do <period> it  's  so  fresh <period> and  here  is  something <comma> nobody  is  obliged  to  be  a  genius <comma> but  everybody  is  obliged  to  participate <period> and  to  participate <comma> for  a  mutant <comma> there  is  a  minimum  of  exercise <comma> a  minimum  of  sport <period> we  can  say  that <period> the  first <comma> if  you  want <comma> there  is  so  many <comma> but  one  which  is  very  easy  to  do <comma> is  the  duty  of  vision <period> i  can  explain  you <period> i  shall  try <period> if  you  walk  like  that <comma> it  's  ok <comma> it  's  ok <comma> you  can  walk <comma> but  perhaps <comma> because  you  walk  with  the  eyes  like  that <comma> you  will  not  see <comma> oh <comma> there  is  a  hole <period> and  you  will  fall <comma> and  you  will  die <period> dangerous <period> that  's  why <comma> perhaps <comma> you  will  try  to  have  this  angle  of  vision <period> ok <comma> i  can  see <comma> if  i  found  something <comma> up <comma> up <comma> and  they  continue <comma> up  up  up <period> i  raise  the  angle  of  vision <comma> but  it  's  still  very <comma> selfish <comma> selfish <comma> egoiste <comma> yes <comma> selfish <period> you <comma> you  survive <period> it  's  ok <period> if  you  raise  the  level  of  your  eyes  a  little  more  you  go <comma> i  see  you <comma> oh  my  god  you  are  here <comma> how  are  you <comma> i  can  help  you <period> i  can  design  for  you  a  new  toothbrush <comma> new  toilet  brush <comma> something  like  that <period> i  live  in  society <period> i  live  in  community <period> it  's  ok <period> you  start  to  be  in  the  territory  of  intelligence <comma> we  can  say <period> from  this  level <comma> the  more  you  can  raise  this  angle  of  view <comma> the  more  you  will  be  important  for  the  society <period> the  more  you  will  rise <comma> the  more  you  will  be  important  for  the  civilization <period> the  more  you  will  rise <comma> to  see  far  and  high <comma> like  that <comma> the  more  you  will  be  important  for  the  story  of  our  mutation <period> that  means  intelligent  people  are  in  this  angle <period> that  is  intelligence <period> from  this  to  here <comma> that <comma> it  's  genius <period> ptolemy <comma> eratosthenes <comma> einstein <comma> things  like  that <period> nobody  's  obliged  to  be  a  genius <period> it  's  better <comma> but  nobody <period> take  care <comma> in  this  training <comma> to  be  a  good  mutant <period> there  is  some  danger <comma> there  is  some  trap <period> one  trap <comma> the  vertical <period> because  at  the  vertical  of  us <comma> if  you  look  like  that <comma> ah <period> my  god <comma> there  is  god <period> ah <period> god <period> god  is  a  trap <period> god  is  the  answer  when  we  do  n't  know  the  answer <period> that  means <comma> when  your  brain  is  not  enough  big <comma> when  you  do  n't  understand <comma> you  go <comma> ah <comma> it  's  god <comma> it  's  god  that  's  ridiculous <period> that  's  why <comma> jump <comma> like  that <questionmark> no <comma> do  n't  jump <period> come  back <period> because <comma> after <comma> there  is  another  trap <period> if  you  look  like  that <comma> you  look  to  the  past <comma> or  you  look  inside  if  you  are  very  flexible <comma> inside  yourself <period> it  's  called  schizophrenia <comma> and  you  are  dead  also <period> that  's  why  every  morning <comma> now <comma> because  you  are  a  good  mutant <comma> you  will  raise  your  angle  of  view <period> out <comma> more  of  the  horizontal <period> you  are  an  intelligence <period> never  forget <comma> like  that <comma> like  that <period> it  's  very <comma> very <comma> very  important <period> what <comma> what  else  we  can  say  about  that <questionmark> why  do  that <questionmark> it  's  because  we <comma> if  we  look  from  far <comma> we  see  our  line  of  evolution <period> this  line  of  evolution  is  clearly  positive <period> from  far <comma> this  line  looks  very  smooth <comma> like  that <period> but  if  you  take  a  lens <comma> like  that <comma> this  line  is  ack <comma> ack <comma> ack <comma> ack <comma> ack <period> like  that <period> it  's  made  of  light  and  shadow <period> we  can  say  light  is  civilization <comma> shadow  is  barbaria <period> and  it  's  very  important  to  know  where  we  are <period> because  some  cycle <comma> there  is  a  spot  in  the  cycle <comma> and  you  have  not  the  same  duty  in  the  different  parts  of  the  cycle <period> that  means <comma> we  can  imagine <comma> i  do  n't  say  it  was  fantastic <comma> but  in  the  80s <comma> there  was  not  too  much  war <comma> like  that <comma> it  was <comma> we  can  imagine  that  the  civilization  can  become  civilized <period> in  this  case <comma> people  like  me  are  acceptable <period> we  can  say <comma> it  's  luxurious  time <period> we  have  time  to  think <comma> we  have  time  to  i  do  n't  know  what <comma> speak  about  art  and  things  like  that <period> it  's  ok <period> we  are  in  the  light <period> but  sometimes <comma> like  today <comma> we  fall <comma> we  fall  so  fast <comma> so  fast  to  shadow <comma> we  fall  so  fast  to  barbaria <period> with  many <comma> many <comma> many <comma> many  face  of  barbaria <period> because  it  's  not <comma> the  barbaria  we  have  today <comma> it  's  perhaps  not  the  barbaria  we  think <period> there  is  different  type  of  barbaria <period> that  's  why  we  must  adapt <period> that  means <comma> when  barbaria  is  back <comma> forget  the  beautiful  chairs <comma> forget  the  beautiful  hotel <comma> forget  design <comma> even <comma> i  'm  sorry  to  say <comma> forget  art <period> forget  all  that <period> there  is  priority <period> there  is  urgency <period> you  must  go  back  to  politics <comma> you  must  go  back  to  radicalization <period> i  'm  sorry  if  that  's  not  very  english <period> you  must  go  back  to  fight <comma> to  battle <period> that  's  why  today  i  'm  so  ashamed  to  make  this  job <period> that  's  why  i  am  here <comma> to  try  to  do  it  the  best  possible <period> but  i  know  that  even  i  do  it  the  best  possible <comma> that  's  why  i  'm  the  best <comma> it  's  nothing <period> because  it  's  not  the  right  time <period> that  's  why  i  say  that <period> i  say  that <comma> because <comma> i  repeat <comma> nothing  exist  if  it  's  not  in  the  good  reason <comma> the  reason  of  our  beautiful  dream <comma> of  this  civilization <period> and  because  we  must  all  work  to  finish  this  story <period> because  the  scenario  of  this  civilization <comma> about  love <comma> progress <comma> and  things  like  that <comma> it  's  ok <comma> but  there  is  so  many  different <comma> other  scenarios  of  other  civilizations <period> this  scenario <comma> of  this  civilization <comma> was  about  becoming  powerful <comma> intelligent <comma> like  this  idea  we  have  invented <comma> this  concept  of  god <period> we  are  god  now <period> we  are <period> it  's  almost  done <period> we  have  just  to  finish  the  story <period> that  is  very <comma> very  important <period> and  when  you  do  n't  understand  really  what  's  happened <comma> you  cannot  go  and  fight  and  work  and  build  and  things  like  that <period> you  go  to  the  future  back <comma> back <comma> back <comma> back <comma> like  that <period> and  you  can  fall <comma> and  it  's  very  dangerous <period> no <comma> you  must  really  understand  that <period> because  we  have  almost  finished <comma> i  'll  repeat  this  story <period> and  the  beauty  of  this <comma> in  perhaps  50  years <comma> 60  years <comma> we  can  finish  completely  this  civilization <period> and  offer  to  our  children  the  possibility  to  invent  a  new  story <comma> a  new  poetry <comma> a  new  romanticism <period> with  billions  of  people  who  have  been  born <comma> worked <comma> lived  and  died  before  us <comma> these  people  who  have  worked  so  much <comma> we  have  now  bring  beautiful  things <comma> beautiful  gifts <comma> we  know  so  many  things <period> we  can  say  to  our  children <comma> ok <comma> done <comma> that  was  our  story <period> that  passed <period> now  you  have  a  duty <comma> invent  a  new  story <period> invent  a  new  poetry <period> the  only  rule  is <comma> we  have  not  to  have  any  idea  about  the  next  story <period> we  give  you  white  pages <period> invent <period> we  give  you  the  best  tools <comma> the  best  tools <comma> and  now <comma> do  it <period> that  's  why  i  continue  to  work <comma> even  if  it  's  for  toilet  brush <period> this  song  is  one  of  thomas  favorites <comma> called  what  you  do  with  what  you've  got <period> you  must  know  someone  like  him  he  was  tall

<comma> to  set  our  earth  in  a  cosmic  context <period> and  let  me  just  run  through  a  few  slides <period> this  was  the  impact  that  happened  last  week  on  a  comet <period> if  they'd  sent  a  nuke <comma> it  would  have  been  rather  more  spectacular  than  what  actually  happened  last  monday <period> so  that  's  another  project  for  nasa <period> that  's  mars  from  the  european  mars  express <comma> and  at  new  year <period> this  artist  's  impression  turned  into  reality  when  a  parachute  landed  on  titan <comma> saturn  's  giant  moon <period> it  landed  on  the  surface <period> this  is  pictures  taken  on  the  way  down <period> that  looks  like  a  coastline <period> it  is  indeed <comma> but  the  ocean  is  liquid  methane <comma> the  temperature  minus  170  degrees  centigrade <period> if  we  go  beyond  our  solar  system <comma> we've  learned  that  the  stars  are  n't  twinkly  points  of  light <period> each  one  is  like  a  sun  with  a  retinue  of  planets  orbiting  around  it <period> and  we  can  see  places  where  stars  are  forming <comma> like  the  eagle  nebula <period> we  see  stars  dying <period> in  six  billion  years <comma> the  sun  will  look  like  that <period> and  some  stars  die  spectacularly  in  a  supernova  explosion <comma> leaving  remnants  like  that <period> on  a  still  bigger  scale <comma> we  see  entire  galaxies  of  stars <period> we  see  entire  ecosystems  where  gas  is  being  recycled <period> and  to  the  cosmologist <comma> these  galaxies  are  just  the  atoms <comma> as  it  were <comma> of  the  large-scale  universe <period> this  picture  shows  a  patch  of  sky  so  small  that  it  would  take  about  100  patches  like  it  to  cover  the  full  moon  in  the  sky <period> through  a  small  telescope <comma> this  would  look  quite  blank <period> but  you  see  here  hundreds  of  little <comma> faint  smudges <period> each  is  a  galaxy <comma> fully  like  ours  or  andromeda <comma> which  looks  so  small  and  faint  because  its  light  has  taken  10  billion  light-years  to  get  to  us <period> the  stars  in  those  galaxies  probably  do  n't  have  planets  around  them <period> there  's  scant  chance  of  life  there <comma> that  's  because  there  's  been  no  time  for  the  nuclear  fusion  in  stars  to  make  silicon  and  carbon  and  iron <comma> the  building  blocks  of  planets  and  of  life <period> we  believe  that  all  of  this  emerged  from  a  big  bang <comma> a  hot <comma> dense  state <period> so  how  did  that  amorphous  big  bang  turn  into  our  complex  cosmos <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  movie  simulation  16  powers  of  10  faster  than  real  time <comma> which  shows  a  patch  of  the  universe  where  the  expansions  have  subtracted  out <period> but  you  see <comma> as  time  goes  on  in  gigayears  at  the  bottom <comma> you  will  see  structures  evolve  as  gravity  feeds  on  small <comma> dense  irregularities <comma> and  structures  develop <period> and  we  'll  end  up  after  13  billion  years  with  something  looking  rather  like  our  own  universe <period> and  we  compare  simulated  universes  like  that <comma> i  'll  show  you  a  better  simulation  at  the  end  of  my  talk <comma> with  what  we  actually  see  in  the  sky <period> well <comma> we  can  trace  things  back  to  the  earlier  stages  of  the  big  bang <comma> but  we  still  do  n't  know  what  banged  and  why  it  banged <period> that  's  a  challenge  for  21st-century  science <period> if  my  research  group  had  a  logo <comma> it  would  be  this  picture  here <comma> an  ouroboros <comma> where  you  see  the  micro-world  on  the  left <comma> the  world  of  the  quantum <comma> and  on  the  right  the  large-scale  universe  of  planets <comma> stars  and  galaxies <period> we  know  our  universes  are  united  though <comma> links  between  left  and  right <period> the  everyday  world  is  determined  by  atoms <comma> how  they  stick  together  to  make  molecules <period> stars  are  fueled  by  how  the  nuclei  in  those  atoms  react  together <period> and <comma> as  we've  learned  in  the  last  few  years <comma> galaxies  are  held  together  by  the  gravitational  pull  of  so-called  dark  matter <comma> particles  in  huge  swarms <comma> far  smaller  even  than  atomic  nuclei <period> but  we'd  like  to  know  the  synthesis  symbolized  at  the  very  top <period> the  micro-world  of  the  quantum  is  understood <period> on  the  right  hand  side <comma> gravity  holds  sway <period> einstein  explained  that <period> but  the  unfinished  business  for  21st-century  science  is  to  link  together  cosmos  and  micro-world  with  a  unified  theory <comma> symbolized <comma> as  it  were <comma> gastronomically  at  the  top  of  that  picture <period> and  until  we  have  that  synthesis <comma> we  wo  n't  be  able  to  understand  the  very  beginning  of  our  universe  because  when  our  universe  was  itself  the  size  of  an  atom <comma> quantum  effects  could  shake  everything <period> and  so  we  need  a  theory  that  unifies  the  very  large  and  the  very  small <comma> which  we  do  n't  yet  have <period> one  idea <comma> incidentally <comma> and  i  had  this  hazard  sign  to  say  i  'm  going  to  speculate  from  now  on <comma> is  that  our  big  bang  was  not  the  only  one <period> one  idea  is  that  our  three-dimensional  universe  may  be  embedded  in  a  high-dimensional  space <comma> just  as  you  can  imagine  on  these  sheets  of  paper <period> you  can  imagine  ants  on  one  of  them  thinking  it  's  a  two-dimensional  universe <comma> not  being  aware  of  another  population  of  ants  on  the  other <period> so  there  could  be  another  universe  just  a  millimeter  away  from  ours <comma> but  we  're  not  aware  of  it  because  that  millimeter  is  measured  in  some  fourth  spatial  dimension <comma> and  we  're  imprisoned  in  our  three <period> and  so  we  believe  that  there  may  be  a  lot  more  to  physical  reality  than  what  we've  normally  called  our  universe <comma> the  aftermath  of  our  big  bang <period> and  here  's  another  picture <period> bottom  right  depicts  our  universe <comma> which  on  the  horizon  is  not  beyond  that <comma> but  even  that  is  just  one  bubble <comma> as  it  were <comma> in  some  vaster  reality <period> many  people  suspect  that  just  as  we've  gone  from  believing  in  one  solar  system  to  zillions  of  solar  systems <comma> one  galaxy  to  many  galaxies <comma> we  have  to  go  to  many  big  bangs  from  one  big  bang <period> perhaps  these  many  big  bangs  displaying  an  immense  variety  of  properties <period> well <comma> let  's  go  back  to  this  picture <period> there  's  one  challenge  symbolized  at  the  top <comma> but  there  's  another  challenge  to  science  symbolized  at  the  bottom <period> you  want  to  not  only  synthesize  the  very  large  and  the  very  small <comma> but  we  want  to  understand  the  very  complex <period> and  the  most  complex  things  are  ourselves <comma> midway  between  atoms  and  stars <period> we  depend  on  stars  to  make  the  atoms  we  're  made  of <period> we  depend  on  chemistry  to  determine  our  complex  structure <period> we  clearly  have  to  be  large <comma> compared  to  atoms <comma> to  have  layer  upon  layer  of  complex  structure <period> we  clearly  have  to  be  small <comma> compared  to  stars  and  planets <comma> otherwise  we'd  be  crushed  by  gravity <period> and  in  fact <comma> we  are  midway <period> it  would  take  as  many  human  bodies  to  make  up  the  sun  as  there  are  atoms  in  each  of  us <period> the  geometric  mean  of  the  mass  of  a  proton  and  the  mass  of  the  sun  is  50  kilograms <comma> within  a  factor  of  two  of  the  mass  of  each  person  here <period> well <comma> most  of  you  anyway <period> the  science  of  complexity  is  probably  the  greatest  challenge  of  all <comma> greater  than  that  of  the  very  small  on  the  left  and  the  very  large  on  the  right <period> and  it  's  this  science <comma> which  is  not  only  enlightening  our  understanding  of  the  biological  world <comma> but  also  transforming  our  world  faster  than  ever <period> and  more  than  that <comma> it  's  engendering  new  kinds  of  change <period> and  i  now  move  on  to  the  second  part  of  my  talk <comma> and  the  book  our  final  century  was  mentioned <period> if  i  was  not  a  self-effacing  brit <comma> i  would  mention  the  book  myself <comma> and  i  would  add  that  it  's  available  in  paperback <period> and  in  america  it  was  called  our  final  hour  because  americans  like  instant  gratification <period> but  my  theme  is  that  in  this  century <comma> not  only  has  science  changed  the  world  faster  than  ever <comma> but  in  new  and  different  ways <period> targeted  drugs <comma> genetic  modification <comma> artificial  intelligence <comma> perhaps  even  implants  into  our  brains <comma> may  change  human  beings  themselves <period> and  human  beings <comma> their  physique  and  character <comma> has  not  changed  for  thousands  of  years <period> it  may  change  this  century <period> it  's  new  in  our  history <period> and  the  human  impact  on  the  global  environment <comma> greenhouse  warming <comma> mass  extinctions  and  so  forth <comma> is  unprecedented <comma> too <period> and  so <comma> this  makes  this  coming  century  a  challenge <period> bio-  and  cybertechnologies  are  environmentally  benign  in  that  they  offer  marvelous  prospects <comma> while <comma> nonetheless <comma> reducing  pressure  on  energy  and  resources <period> but  they  will  have  a  dark  side <period> in  our  interconnected  world <comma> novel  technology  could  empower  just  one  fanatic <comma> or  some  weirdo  with  a  mindset  of  those  who  now  design  computer  viruses <comma> to  trigger  some  kind  on  disaster <period> indeed <comma> catastrophe  could  arise  simply  from  technical  misadventure <comma> error  rather  than  terror <period> and  even  a  tiny  probability  of  catastrophe  is  unacceptable  when  the  downside  could  be  of  global  consequence <period> in  fact <comma> some  years  ago <comma> bill  joy  wrote  an  article  expressing  tremendous  concern  about  robots  taking  us  over <comma> etc <period> i  do  n't  go  along  with  all  that <comma> but  it  's  interesting  that  he  had  a  simple  solution <period> it  was  what  he  called  fine-grained  relinquishment <period> he  wanted  to  give  up  the  dangerous  kind  of  science  and  keep  the  good  bits <period> now <comma> that  's  absurdly  naive  for  two  reasons <period> first <comma> any  scientific  discovery  has  benign  consequences  as  well  as  dangerous  ones <period> and  also <comma> when  a  scientist  makes  a  discovery <comma> he  or  she  normally  has  no  clue  what  the  applications  are  going  to  be <period> and  so  what  this  means  is  that  we  have  to  accept  the  risks  if  we  are  going  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  science <period> we  have  to  accept  that  there  will  be  hazards <period> and  i  think  we  have  to  go  back  to  what  happened  in  the  post-war  era <comma> post-world  war  ii <comma> when  the  nuclear  scientists  who'd  been  involved  in  making  the  atomic  bomb <comma> in  many  cases  were  concerned  that  they  should  do  all  they  could  to  alert  the  world  to  the  dangers <period> and  they  were  inspired  not  by  the  young  einstein <comma> who  did  the  great  work  in  relativity <comma> but  by  the  old  einstein <comma> the  icon  of  poster  and  t-shirt <comma> who  failed  in  his  scientific  efforts  to  unify  the  physical  laws <period> he  was  premature <period> but  he  was  a  moral  compass <comma> an  inspiration  to  scientists  who  were  concerned  with  arms  control <period> and  perhaps  the  greatest  living  person  is  someone  i  'm  privileged  to  know <comma> joe  rothblatt <period> equally  untidy  office  there <comma> as  you  can  see <period> he  's  96  years  old <comma> and  he  founded  the  pugwash  movement <period> he  persuaded  einstein <comma> as  his  last  act <comma> to  sign  the  famous  memorandum  of  bertrand  russell <period> and  he  sets  an  example  of  the  concerned  scientist <period> and  i  think  to  harness  science  optimally <comma> to  choose  which  doors  to  open  and  which  to  leave  closed <comma> we  need  latter-day  counterparts  of  people  like  joseph  rothblatt <period> we  need  not  just  campaigning  physicists <comma> but  we  need  biologists <comma> computer  experts  and  environmentalists  as  well <period> and  i  think  academics  and  independent  entrepreneurs  have  a  special  obligation  because  they  have  more  freedom  than  those  in  government  service <comma> or  company  employees  subject  to  commercial  pressure <period> i  wrote  my  book <comma> our  final  century <comma> as  a  scientist <comma> just  a  general  scientist <period> but  there  's  one  respect <comma> i  think <comma> in  which  being  a  cosmologist  offered  a  special  perspective <comma> and  that  's  that  it  offers  an  awareness  of  the  immense  future <period> the  stupendous  time  spans  of  the  evolutionary  past  are  now  part  of  common  culture <comma> outside  the  american  bible  belt <comma> anyway <comma> but  most  people <comma> even  those  who  are  familiar  with  evolution <comma> are  n't  mindful  that  even  more  time  lies  ahead <period> the  sun  has  been  shining  for  four  and  a  half  billion  years <comma> but  it  'll  be  another  six  billion  years  before  its  fuel  runs  out <period> on  that  schematic  picture <comma> a  sort  of  time-lapse  picture <comma> we  're  halfway <period> and  it  'll  be  another  six  billion  before  that  happens <comma> and  any  remaining  life  on  earth  is  vaporized <period> there  's  an  unthinking  tendency  to  imagine  that  humans  will  be  there <comma> experiencing  the  sun  's  demise <comma> but  any  life  and  intelligence  that  exists  then  will  be  as  different  from  us  as  we  are  from  bacteria <period> the  unfolding  of  intelligence  and  complexity  still  has  immensely  far  to  go <comma> here  on  earth  and  probably  far  beyond <period> so  we  are  still  at  the  beginning  of  the  emergence  of  complexity  in  our  earth  and  beyond <period> if  you  represent  the  earth  's  lifetime  by  a  single  year <comma> say  from  january  when  it  was  made  to  december <comma> the  21st-century  would  be  a  quarter  of  a  second  in  june <comma> a  tiny  fraction  of  the  year <period> but  even  in  this  concertinaed  cosmic  perspective <comma> our  century  is  very <comma> very  special <period> the  first  when  humans  can  change  themselves  and  their  home  planet <period> as  i  should  have  shown  this  earlier <comma> it  will  not  be  humans  who  witness  the  end  point  of  the  sun <period> it  will  be  creatures  as  different  from  us  as  we  are  from  bacteria <period> when  einstein  died  in  1955 <comma> one  striking  tribute  to  his  global  status  was  this  cartoon  by  herblock  in  the  washington  post <period> the  plaque  reads <comma> albert  einstein  lived  here <period> and  i'd  like  to  end  with  a  vignette <comma> as  it  were <comma> inspired  by  this  image <period> we've  been  familiar  for  40  years  with  this  image <comma> the  fragile  beauty  of  land <comma> ocean  and  clouds <comma> contrasted  with  the  sterile  moonscape  on  which  the  astronauts  left  their  footprints <period> but  let  's  suppose  some  aliens  had  been  watching  our  pale  blue  dot  in  the  cosmos  from  afar <comma> not  just  for  40  years <comma> but  for  the  entire  45  billion-year  history  of  our  earth <period> what  would  they  have  seen <questionmark> over  nearly  all  that  immense  time <comma> earth  's  appearance  would  have  changed  very  gradually <period> the  only  abrupt  worldwide  change  would  have  been  major  asteroid  impacts  or  volcanic  super-eruptions <period> apart  from  those  brief  traumas <comma> nothing  happens  suddenly <period> the  continental  landmasses  drifted  around <period> ice  cover  waxed  and  waned <period> successions  of  new  species  emerged <comma> evolved  and  became  extinct <period> but  in  just  a  tiny  sliver  of  the  earth  's  history <comma> the  last  one-millionth  part <comma> a  few  thousand  years <comma> the  patterns  of  vegetation  altered  much  faster  than  before <period> this  signaled  the  start  of  agriculture <period> change  has  accelerated  as  human  populations  rose <period> then  other  things  happened  even  more  abruptly <period> within  just  50  years <comma> that  's  one  hundredth  of  one  millionth  of  the  earth  's  age <comma> the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere  started  to  rise <comma> and  ominously  fast <period> the  planet  became  an  intense  emitter  of  radio  waves <comma> the  total  output  from  all  tv  and  cell  phones  and  radar  transmissions <period> and  something  else  happened <period> metallic  objects <comma> albeit  very  small  ones <comma> a  few  tons  at  most <comma> escaped  into  orbit  around  the  earth <period> some  journeyed  to  the  moons  and  planets <period> a  race  of  advanced  extraterrestrials  watching  our  solar  system  from  afar  could  confidently  predict  earth  's  final  doom  in  another  six  billion  years <period> but  could  they  have  predicted  this  unprecedented  spike  less  than  halfway  through  the  earth  's  life <questionmark> these  human-induced  alterations  occupying  overall  less  than  a  millionth  of  the  elapsed  lifetime  and  seemingly  occurring  with  runaway  speed <questionmark> if  they  continued  their  vigil <comma> what  might  these  hypothetical  aliens  witness  in  the  next  hundred  years <questionmark> will  some  spasm  foreclose  earth  's  future <questionmark> or  will  the  biosphere  stabilize <questionmark> or  will  some  of  the  metallic  objects  launched  from  the  earth  spawn  new  oases <comma> a  post-human  life  elsewhere <questionmark> the  science  done  by  the  young  einstein  will  continue  as  long  as  our  civilization <comma> but  for  civilization  to  survive <comma> we  'll  need  the  wisdom  of  the  old  einstein <comma> humane <comma> global  and  farseeing <period> and  whatever  happens  in  this  uniquely  crucial  century  will  resonate  into  the  remote  future  and  perhaps  far  beyond  the  earth <comma> far  beyond  the  earth  as  depicted  here <period> thank  you  very  much <period> good  afternoon <period> there  's  a  medical  revolution  happening  all  around  us <comma> and  it  's  one  that  's  going  to  help  us  conquer  some  of  society  's  most  dreaded  conditions <comma> including  cancer <period> the  revolution  is  called  angiogenesis <comma> and  it  's  based  on  the  process  that  our  bodies  use  to  grow  blood  vessels <period> so  why  should  we  care  about  blood  vessels <questionmark> well <comma> the  human  body  is  literally  packed  with  them <comma> 60,000  miles  worth  in  a  typical  adult <period> end  to  end <comma> that  would  form  a  line  that  would  circle  the  earth  twice <period> the  smallest  blood  vessels  are  called  capillaries <period> we've  got  19  billion  of  them  in  our  bodies <period> and  these  are  the  vessels  of  life <comma> and <comma> as  i  'll  show  you <comma> they  can  also  be  the  vessels  of  death <period> now  the  remarkable  thing  about  blood  vessels  is  that  they  have  this  ability  to  adapt  to  whatever  environment  they  're  growing  in <period> for  example <comma> in  the  liver  they  form  channels  to  detoxify  the  blood <period> in  the  lung  they  line  air  sacs  for  gas  exchange <period> in  muscle  they  corkscrew  so  that  muscles  can  contract  without  cutting  off  circulation <period> and  in  nerves  they  course  along  like  power  lines <comma> keeping  those  nerves  alive <period> we  get  most  of  these  blood  vessels  when  we  're  actually  still  in  the  womb <period> and  what  that  means  is  that  as  adults <comma> blood  vessels  do  n't  normally  grow <period> except  in  a  few  special  circumstances: <period> in  women <comma> blood  vessels  grow  every  month  to  build  the  lining  of  the  uterus <period> during  pregnancy <comma> they  form  the  placenta <comma> which  connects  mom  and  baby <period> and  after  injury <comma> blood  vessels  actually  have  to  grow  under  the  scab  in  order  to  heal  a  wound <period> and  this  is  actually  what  it  looks  like <period> hundreds  of  blood  vessels  all  growing  toward  the  center  of  the  wound <period> so  the  body  has  the  ability  to  regulate  the  amount  of  blood  vessels  that  are  present  at  any  given  time <period> it  does  this  through  an  elaborate  and  elegant  system  of  checks  and  balances <comma> stimulators  and  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis <comma> such  that <comma> when  we  need  a  brief  burst  of  blood  vessels <comma> the  body  can  do  this  by  releasing  stimulators <comma> proteins  called  angiogenic  factors  that  act  as  natural  fertilizer  and  stimulate  new  blood  vessels  to  sprout <period> and  when  those  excess  vessels  are  no  longer  needed <comma> the  body  prunes  them  back  to  baseline  using  naturally  occurring  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis <period> now  there  are  other  situations  where  we  start  beneath  the  baseline  and  we  need  to  grow  more  blood  vessels  just  to  get  back  to  normal  levels  -- <period> for  example <comma> after  an  injury  -- <period> and  a  body  can  do  that  too <comma> but  only  to  that  normal  level <comma> that  set  point <period> but  what  we  now  know  is  that  for  a  number  of  diseases <comma> there  are  defects  in  the  system  where  the  body  cannot  prune  back  extra  blood  vessels  or  cannot  grow  enough  new  ones  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time <period> and  in  these  situations <comma> angiogenesis  is  out  of  balance <period> and  when  angiogenesis  is  out  of  balance <comma> a  myriad  of  diseases  result <period> for  example <comma> insufficient  angiogenesis <comma> not  enough  blood  vessels <comma> leads  to  wounds  that  do  n't  heal <comma> heart  attacks <comma> legs  without  circulation <comma> death  from  stroke <comma> nerve  damage <period> and  on  the  other  end <comma> excessive  angiogenesis <comma> too  many  blood  vessels <comma> drives  disease <period> and  we  see  this  in  cancer <comma> blindness <comma> arthritis <comma> obesity <comma> alzheimer  's  disease <period> in  total <comma> there  are  more  than  70  major  diseases  affecting  more  than  a  billion  people  worldwide <comma> that  all  look  on  the  surface  to  be  different  from  one  another <comma> but  all  actually  share  abnormal  angiogenesis  as  their  common  denominator <period> and  this  realization  is  allowing  us  to  reconceptualize  the  way  that  we  actually  approach  these  diseases  by  controlling  angiogenesis <period> now  i  'm  going  to  focus  on  cancer  because  angiogenesis  is  a  hallmark  of  cancer <comma> every  type  of  cancer <period> so  here  we  go <period> this  is  a  tumor <comma> dark <comma> gray <comma> ominous  mass  growing  inside  a  brain <period> and  under  the  microscope <comma> you  can  see  hundreds  of  these  brown  staining  blood  vessels <comma> capillaries  that  are  feeding  cancer  cells <comma> bringing  oxygen  and  nutrients <period> but  cancers  do  n't  start  out  like  this <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> cancers  do  n't  start  out  with  a  blood  supply <period> they  start  out  as  small <comma> microscopic  nests  of  cells  that  can  only  grow  to  one  half  a  cubic  millimeter  in  size <period> that  's  the  tip  of  a  ballpoint  pen <period> then  they  cannot  get  any  larger  because  they  do  n't  have  a  blood  supply <comma> so  they  do  n't  have  enough  oxygen  or  nutrients <period> in  fact <comma> we  're  probably  forming  these  microscopic  cancers  all  the  time  in  our  body <period> autopsy  studies  from  people  who  died  in  car  accidents  have  shown  that  about  40  percent  of  women  between  the  ages  of  40  and  50  actually  have  microscopic  cancers  in  their  breasts <period> about  50  percent  of  men  in  their  50s  and  60s  have  microscopic  prostate  cancers <period> and  virtually  100  percent  of  us <comma> by  the  time  we  reach  our  70s <comma> will  have  microscopic  cancers  growing  in  our  thyroid <period> yet <comma> without  a  blood  supply <comma> most  of  these  cancers  will  never  become  dangerous <period> dr.  judah  folkman <comma> who  was  my  mentor  and  who  was  the  pioneer  of  the  angiogenesis  field <comma> once  called  this  cancer  without  disease <period> so  the  body  's  ability  to  balance  angiogenesis <comma> when  it  's  working  properly <comma> prevents  blood  vessels  from  feeding  cancers <period> and  this  turns  out  to  be  one  of  our  most  important  defense  mechanisms  against  cancer <period> in  fact <comma> if  you  actually  block  angiogenesis  and  prevent  blood  vessels  from  ever  reaching  cancer  cells <comma> tumors  simply  cannot  grow  up <period> but  once  angiogenesis  occurs <comma> cancers  can  grow  exponentially <period> and  this  is  actually  how  a  cancer  goes  from  being  harmless  to  deadly <period> cancer  cells  mutate  and  they  gain  the  ability  to  release  lots  of  those  angiogenic  factors <comma> natural  fertilizer <comma> that  tip  the  balance  in  favor  of  blood  vessels  invading  the  cancer <period> and  once  those  vessels  invade  the  cancer <comma> it  can  expand <comma> it  can  invade  local  tissues <period> and  the  same  vessels  that  are  feeding  tumors  allow  cancer  cells  to  exit  into  the  circulation  as  metastases <period> and <comma> unfortunately <comma> this  late  stage  of  cancer  is  the  one  at  which  it  's  most  likely  to  be  diagnosed <comma> when  angiogenesis  is  already  turned  on  and  cancer  cells  are  growing  like  wild <period> so <comma> if  angiogenesis  is  a  tipping  point  between  a  harmless  cancer  and  a  harmful  one <comma> then  one  major  part  of  the  angiogenesis  revolution  is  a  new  approach  to  treating  cancer  by  cutting  off  the  blood  supply <period> we  call  this  antiangiogenic  therapy <comma> and  it  's  completely  different  from  chemotherapy  because  it  selectively  aims  at  the  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  the  cancers <period> and  we  can  do  this  because  tumor  blood  vessels  are  unlike  normal <comma> healthy  vessels  we  see  in  other  places  of  the  body: <period> they  're  abnormal <period> they  're  very  poorly  constructed <period> and <comma> because  of  that <comma> they  're  highly  vulnerable  to  treatments  that  target  them <period> in  effect <comma> when  we  give  cancer  patients  antiangiogenic  therapy <comma> here <comma> an  experimental  drug  for  a  glioma <comma> which  is  a  type  of  brain  tumor <comma> you  can  see  that  there  are  dramatic  changes  that  occur  when  the  tumor  is  being  starved <period> here  's  a  woman  with  a  breast  cancer  being  treated  with  the  antiangiogenic  drug  called  avastin <comma> which  is  fda  approved <period> and  you  can  see  that  the  halo  of  blood  flow  disappears  after  treatment <period> well <comma> i've  just  shown  you  two  very  different  types  of  cancer  that  both  responded  to  antiangiogenic  therapy <period> so <comma> a  few  years  ago <comma> i  asked  myself <comma> can  we  take  this  one  step  further  and  treat  other  cancers <comma> even  in  other  species <questionmark> so  here  is  a  nine  year-old  boxer  named  milo  who  had  a  very  aggressive  tumor  called  a  malignant  neurofibroma  growing  on  his  shoulder <period> it  invaded  into  his  lungs <period> his  veterinarian  only  gave  him  three  months  to  live <period> so  we  created  a  cocktail  of  antiangiogenic  drugs  that  could  be  mixed  into  his  dog  food  as  well  as  an  antiangiogenic  cream  that  could  be  applied  on  the  surface  of  the  tumor <period> and  within  a  few  weeks  of  treatment <comma> we  were  able  to  slow  down  that  cancer  's  growth  such  that  we  were  ultimately  able  to  extend  milo  's  survival  to  six  times  what  the  veterinarian  had  initially  predicted <comma> all  with  a  very  good  quality  of  life <period> and  we  subsequently  treated  more  than  600  dogs <period> we  have  about  a  60  percent  response  rate  and  improved  survival  for  these  pets  that  were  about  to  be  euthanized <period> so  let  me  show  you  a  couple  of  even  more  interesting  examples <period> this  is  20-year-old  dolphin  living  in  florida <comma> and  she  had  these  lesions  in  her  mouth  that <comma> over  the  course  of  three  years <comma> developed  into  invasive  squamous  cell  cancers <period> so  we  created  an  antiangiogenic  paste <period> we  had  it  painted  on  top  of  the  cancer  three  times  a  week <period> and  over  the  course  of  seven  months <comma> the  cancers  completely  disappeared <comma> and  the  biopsies  came  back  as  normal <period> here  's  a  cancer  growing  on  the  lip  of  a  wuarter  horse  named  guinness <period> it  's  a  very <comma> very  deadly  type  of  cancer  called  an  angiosarcoma <period> it  had  already  spread  to  his  lymph  nodes <comma> so  we  used  an  antiangiogenic  skin  cream  for  the  lip  and  an  oral  cocktail <comma> so  we  could  treat  from  the  inside  as  well  as  the  outside <period> and  over  the  course  of  six  months <comma> he  experienced  a  complete  remission <period> and  here  he  is  six  years  later <comma> guinness <comma> with  his  very  happy  owner <period> now <comma> obviously <comma> antiangiogenic  therapy  could  be  used  for  a  wide  range  of  cancers <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> the  first  pioneering  treatments  for  people <comma> as  well  as  dogs <comma> are  already  becoming  available <period> there  's  12  different  drugs <comma> 11  different  cancer  types <period> but  the  real  question  is <comma> how  well  do  these  work  in  practice <questionmark> so  here  's  actually  the  patient  survival  data  from  eight  different  types  of  cancer <period> the  bars  represent  survival  time  taken  from  the  era  in  which  there  was  only  chemotherapy <comma> or  surgery <comma> or  radiation  available <period> but  starting  in  2004 <comma> when  antiangiogenic  therapies  first  became  available <comma> well  you  can  see  that  there  has  been  a  70  to  100  percent  improvement  in  survival  for  people  with  kidney  cancer <comma> multiple  myeloma <comma> colorectal  cancer <comma> and  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumors <period> that  's  impressive <period> but  for  other  tumors  and  cancer  types <comma> the  improvements  have  only  been  modest <period> so  i  started  asking  myself <comma> why  have  n't  we  been  able  to  do  better <questionmark> and  the  answer <comma> to  me <comma> is  obvious <period> we  're  treating  cancer  too  late  in  the  game <comma> when  it  's  already  established  and <comma> oftentimes <comma> it  's  already  spread  or  metastasized <period> and  as  a  doctor <comma> i  know  that  once  a  disease  progresses  to  an  advanced  stage <comma> achieving  a  cure  can  be  difficult <comma> if  not  impossible <period> so  i  went  back  to  the  biology  of  angiogenesis  and  started  thinking <comma> could  the  answer  to  cancer  be  preventing  angiogenesis <comma> beating  cancer  at  its  own  game  so  the  cancers  could  never  become  dangerous <questionmark> this  could  help  healthy  people  as  well  as  people  who've  already  beaten  cancer  once  or  twice  and  want  to  find  a  way  to  keep  it  from  coming  back <period> so  to  look  for  a  way  to  prevent  angiogenesis  in  cancer <comma> i  went  back  to  look  at  cancer  's  causes <period> and  what  really  intrigued  me  was  when  i  saw  that  diet  accounts  for  30  to  35  percent  of  environmentally  caused  cancers <period> now <comma> the  obvious  thing  is  to  think  about  what  we  could  remove  from  our  diet <comma> what  to  strip  out <comma> take  away <period> but  i  actually  took  a  completely  opposite  approach  and  began  asking <comma> what  could  we  be  adding  to  our  diet  that  's  naturally  antiangiogenic <comma> that  could  boost  the  body  's  defense  system  and  beat  back  those  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  cancers <questionmark> in  other  words <comma> can  we  eat  to  starve  cancer <questionmark> well <comma> the  answer  's  yes <period> and  i  'm  going  to  show  you  how <period> our  search  for  this  has  taken  us  to  the  market <comma> the  farm  and  to  the  spice  cabinet <comma> because  what  we've  discovered  is  that  mother  nature  has  laced  a  large  number  of  foods  and  beverages  and  herbs  with  naturally  occurring  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis <period> so  here  's  a  test  system  we  developed <period> at  the  center  is  a  ring  from  which  hundreds  of  blood  vessels  are  growing  out  in  a  starburst  fashion <period> and  we  can  use  this  system  to  test  dietary  factors  at  concentrations  that  are  obtainable  by  eating <period> so  let  me  show  you  what  happens  when  we  put  in  an  extract  from  red  grapes <period> the  active  ingredient  's  resveratrol <period> it  's  also  found  in  red  wine <period> this  inhibits  abnormal  angiogenesis  by  60  percent <period> here  's  what  happens  when  we  added  an  extract  from  strawberries <period> it  potently  inhibits  angiogenesis <period> and  extract  from  soybeans <period> and  here  is  a  growing  list  of  our  antiangiogenic  foods  and  beverages  that  we  're  interested  in  studying <period> for  each  food  type <comma> we  believe  that  there  are  different  potencies  within  different  strains  and  varietals <period> and  we  want  to  measure  this  because <comma> well <comma> while  you  're  eating  a  strawberry  or  drinking  tea <comma> why  not  select  the  one  that  's  most  potent  for  preventing  cancer <period> so  here  are  four  different  teas  that  we've  tested <period> they  're  all  common  ones <comma> chinese  jasmine <comma> japanese  sencha <comma> earl  grey  and  a  special  blend  that  we  prepared <period> and  you  can  see  clearly  that  the  teas  vary  in  their  potency  from  less  potent  to  more  potent <period> but  what  's  very  cool  is  when  we  actually  combined  the  two  less  potent  teas  together <comma> the  combination <comma> the  blend <comma> is  more  potent  than  either  one  alone <period> this  means  there  's  food  synergy <period> here  's  some  more  data  from  our  testing <period> now <comma> in  the  lab <comma> we  can  simulate  tumor  angiogenesis  represented  here  in  a  black  bar <period> and  using  this  system <comma> we  can  test  the  potency  of  cancer  drugs <period> so  the  shorter  the  bar <comma> less  angiogenesis <comma> that  's  good <period> and  here  are  some  common  drugs  that  have  been  associated  with  reducing  the  risk  of  cancer  in  people <period> statins <comma> nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  a  few  others <comma> they  inhibit  angiogenesis  too <period> and  here  are  the  dietary  factors  going  head  to  head  against  these  drugs <period> you  can  see <comma> they  clearly  hold  their  own  and <comma> in  some  cases <comma> they  're  more  potent  than  the  actual  drugs <period> soy <comma> parsley <comma> garlic <comma> grapes <comma> berries <period> i  could  go  home  and  cook  a  tasty  meal  using  these  ingredients <period> so  imagine  if  we  could  create  the  world  's  first  rating  system  in  which  we  could  score  foods  according  to  their  antiangiogenic <comma> cancer-preventative  properties <period> and  that  's  what  we  're  doing  right  now <period> now <comma> i've  shown  you  a  bunch  of  lab  data <comma> and  so  the  real  question  is <comma> what  is  the  evidence  in  people  that  eating  certain  foods  can  reduce  angiogenesis  in  cancer <questionmark> well <comma> the  best  example  i  know  is  a  study  of  79,000  men  followed  over  20  years <comma> in  which  it  was  found  that  men  who  consumed  cooked  tomatoes  two  to  three  times  a  week  had  up  to  a  50  percent  reduction  in  their  risk  of  developing  prostate  cancer <period> now <comma> we  know  that  tomatoes  are  a  good  source  of  lycopene <comma> and  lycopene  is  antiangiogenic <period> but  what  's  even  more  interesting  from  this  study  is  that  in  those  men  who  did  develop  prostate  cancer <comma> those  who  ate  more  servings  of  tomato  sauce  actually  had  fewer  blood  vessels  feeding  their  cancer <period> so  this  human  study  is  a  prime  example  of  how  antiangiogenic  substances  present  in  food  and  consumed  at  practical  levels  can  impact  on  cancer <period> and  we  're  now  studying  the  role  of  a  healthy  diet  with  dean  ornish  at  ucsf  and  tufts  university  on  the  role  of  this  healthy  diet  on  markers  of  angiogenesis  that  we  can  find  in  the  bloodstream <period> now <comma> obviously <comma> what  i've  shared  with  you  has  some  far-ranging  implications <comma> even  beyond  cancer  research <period> because  if  we  're  right <comma> it  could  impact  on  consumer  education <comma> food  services <comma> public  health  and  even  the  insurance  industry <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> some  insurance  companies  are  already  beginning  to  think  along  these  lines <period> check  out  this  ad  from  blue  cross  blue  shield  of  minnesota <period> and  for  many  people  around  the  world <comma> dietary  cancer  prevention  may  be  the  only  practical  solution  because  not  everybody  can  afford  expensive  end-stage  cancer  treatments <comma> but  everybody  could  benefit  from  a  healthy  diet  based  on  local <comma> sustainable <comma> antiangiogenic  crops <period> now <comma> finally <comma> i've  talked  to  you  about  food <comma> and  i've  talked  to  you  about  cancer <comma> so  there  's  just  one  more  disease  that  i  have  to  tell  you  about  and  that  's  obesity <period> because  it  turns  out  that  adipose  tissue <comma> fat <comma> is  highly  angiogenesis  dependent <period> and <comma> like  a  tumor <comma> fat  grows  when  blood  vessels  grow <period> so  the  question  is <comma> can  we  shrink  fat  by  cutting  off  its  blood  supply <questionmark> so  the  top  curve  shows  the  body  weight  of  a  genetically  obese  mouse  that  eats  nonstop  until  it  turns  fat <comma> like  this  furry  tennis  ball <period> and  the  bottom  curve  is  the  weight  of  a  normal  mouse <period> if  you  take  the  obese  mouse  and  give  it  an  angiogenesis  inhibitor <comma> it  loses  weight <period> stop  the  treatment <comma> gains  the  weight  back <period> restart  the  treatment <comma> loses  the  weight  again <period> stop  the  treatment <comma> it  gains  the  weight  back <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> you  can  cycle  the  weight  up  and  down  simply  by  inhibiting  angiogenesis <period> so  this  approach  that  we  're  taking  for  cancer  prevention  may  also  have  an  application  for  obesity <period> the  really <comma> truly  interesting  thing  about  this  is  that  we  cannot  take  these  obese  mice  and  make  them  lose  more  weight  than  what  the  normal  mouse  's  weight  is  supposed  to  be <period> in  other  words <comma> we  cannot  create  supermodel  mice <period> and  this  speaks  to  the  role  of  angiogenesis  in  regulating  healthy  set  points <period> albert  szent-gyorgi  once  said  that <comma> discovery  consists  of  seeing  what  everyone  has  seen <comma> and  thinking  what  no  one  has  thought <period> i  hope  i've  convinced  you  that <comma> for  diseases  like  cancer <comma> obesity  and  other  conditions <comma> that  there  may  be  a  great  power  in  attacking  their  common  denominator <comma> angiogenesis <period> and  that  's  what  i  think  the  world  needs  now <period> thank  you <period> june  cohen <comma> i  have  a  quick  question  for  you <period> so  these  drugs  are  n't  exactly <period> they  're  not  exactly  in  mainstream  cancer  treatments  right  now <period> for  anyone  out  here  who  has  cancer <comma> what  would  you  recommend <questionmark> do  you  recommend  pursuing  these  treatments  now <comma> for  most  cancer  patients <questionmark> william  li <comma> so  there  are  antiangiogenic  treatments  that  are  fda  approved <period> and  if  you  're  a  cancer  patient  or  working  for  one  or  advocating  for  one <comma> you  should  ask  about  them <period> and  there  are  many  clinical  trials <period> the  angiogenesis  foundation  is  following  almost  300  companies <comma> and  there  are  about  100  more  drugs  in  that  pipeline <period> so  consider  the  approved  ones <comma> look  for  clinical  trials <comma> but  then  between  what  the  doctor  can  do  for  you <comma> we  need  to  start  asking  what  can  we  do  for  ourselves <period> and  this  is  one  of  the  themes  that  i  'm  talking  about  is  we  can  empower  ourselves  to  do  the  things  that  doctors  cannot  do  for  us <comma> which  is  to  use  knowledge  and  take  action <period> and  if  mother  nature  has  given  us  some  clues <comma> we  think  that  there  might  be  a  new  future  in  the  value  of  how  we  eat <period> and  what  we  eat  is  really  our  chemotherapy  three  times  a  day <period> jc <comma> right <period> and  along  those  lines <comma> for  people  who  might  have  risk  factors  for  cancer <comma> would  you  recommend  pursuing  any  treatments  sort  of  prophylactically  or  simply  pursuing  the  right  diet  with  lots  of  tomato  sauce <questionmark> wl <comma> well <comma> you  know <comma> there  's  abundant  epidemiological  evidence <period> and  i  think  in  the  information  age <comma> it  does  n't  take  long  to  go  to  a  credible  source  like  pubmed <comma> the  national  library  of  medicine <comma> to  look  for  epidemiological  studies  for  cancer  risk  reduction  based  on  diet  and  based  on  common  medications <period> and  that  's  certainly  something  that  anybody  can  look  into <period> jc <comma> okay <period> well <comma> thank  you  so  much <period> so  for  any  of  us  in  this  room  today <comma> let  's  start  out  by  admitting  we  're  lucky <period> we  do  n't  live  in  the  world  our  mothers  lived  in <comma> our  grandmothers  lived  in <comma> where  career  choices  for  women  were  so  limited <period> and  if  you  're  in  this  room  today <comma> most  of  us  grew  up  in  a  world  where  we  had  basic  civil  rights <period> and  amazingly <comma> we  still  live  in  a  world  where  some  women  do  n't  have  them <period> but  all  that  aside <comma> we  still  have  a  problem <comma> and  it  's  a  real  problem <period> and  the  problem  is  this <comma> women  are  not  making  it  to  the  top  of  any  profession  anywhere  in  the  world <period> the  numbers  tell  the  story  quite  clearly <period> 190  heads  of  state <comma> nine  are  women <period> of  all  the  people  in  parliament  in  the  world <comma> 13  percent  are  women <period> in  the  corporate  sector <comma> women  at  the  top <comma> c-level  jobs <comma> board  seats <comma> tops  out  at  15 <comma> 16  percent <period> the  numbers  have  not  moved  since  2002  and  are  going  in  the  wrong  direction <period> and  even  in  the  non-profit  world <comma> a  world  we  sometimes  think  of  as  being  led  by  more  women <comma> women  at  the  top <comma> 20  percent <period> we  also  have  another  problem <comma> which  is  that  women  face  harder  choices  between  professional  success  and  personal  fulfillment <period> a  recent  study  in  the  us <period> showed  that <comma> of  married  senior  managers <comma> two-thirds  of  the  married  men  had  children  and  only  one-third  of  the  married  women  had  children <period> a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> i  was  in  new  york <comma> and  i  was  pitching  a  deal <comma> and  i  was  in  one  of  those  fancy  new  york  private  equity  offices  you  can  picture <period> and  i  'm  in  the  meeting <comma> it  's  about  a  three-hour  meeting <comma> and  two  hours  in <comma> there  kind  of  needs  to  be  that  bio  break <comma> and  everyone  stands  up <comma> and  the  partner  running  the  meeting  starts  looking  really  embarrassed <period> and  i  realized  he  does  n't  know  where  the  women  's  room  is  in  his  office <period> so  i  start  looking  around  for  moving  boxes <comma> figuring  they  just  moved  in <comma> but  i  do  n't  see  any <period> and  so  i  said <comma> did  you  just  move  into  this  office <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> no <comma> we've  been  here  about  a  year <period> and  i  said <comma> are  you  telling  me  that  i  am  the  only  woman  to  have  pitched  a  deal  in  this  office  in  a  year <questionmark> and  he  looked  at  me <comma> and  he  said <comma> yeah <period> or  maybe  you  're  the  only  one  who  had  to  go  to  the  bathroom <period> so  the  question  is <comma> how  are  we  going  to  fix  this <questionmark> how  do  we  change  these  numbers  at  the  top <questionmark> how  do  we  make  this  different <questionmark> i  want  to  start  out  by  saying <comma> i  talk  about  this <comma> about  keeping  women  in  the  workforce <comma> because  i  really  think  that  's  the  answer <period> in  the  high-income  part  of  our  workforce <comma> in  the  people  who  end  up  at  the  top <comma> fortune  500  ceo  jobs <comma> or  the  equivalent  in  other  industries <comma> the  problem <comma> i  am  convinced <comma> is  that  women  are  dropping  out <period> now  people  talk  about  this  a  lot <comma> and  they  talk  about  things  like  flextime  and  mentoring  and  programs  companies  should  have  to  train  women <period> i  want  to  talk  about  none  of  that  today <comma> even  though  that  's  all  really  important <period> today  i  want  to  focus  on  what  we  can  do  as  individuals <period> what  are  the  messages  we  need  to  tell  ourselves <questionmark> what  are  the  messages  we  tell  the  women  who  work  with  and  for  us <questionmark> what  are  the  messages  we  tell  our  daughters <questionmark> now <comma> at  the  outset <comma> i  want  to  be  very  clear  that  this  speech  comes  with  no  judgments <period> i  do  n't  have  the  right  answer <period> i  do  n't  even  have  it  for  myself <period> i  left  san  francisco <comma> where  i  live <comma> on  monday <comma> and  i  was  getting  on  the  plane  for  this  conference <period> and  my  daughter <comma> who  's  three <comma> when  i  dropped  her  off  at  preschool <comma> did  that  whole  hugging-the-leg <comma> crying <comma> mommy <comma> do  n't  get  on  the  plane  thing <period> this  is  hard <period> i  feel  guilty  sometimes <period> i  know  no  women <comma> whether  they  're  at  home  or  whether  they  're  in  the  workforce <comma> who  do  n't  feel  that  sometimes <period> so  i  'm  not  saying  that  staying  in  the  workforce  is  the  right  thing  for  everyone <period> my  talk  today  is  about  what  the  messages  are  if  you  do  want  to  stay  in  the  workforce <period> and  i  think  there  are  three <period> one <comma> sit  at  the  table <period> two <comma> make  your  partner  a  real  partner <period> and  three <comma> do  n't  leave  before  you  leave <period> number  one <comma> sit  at  the  table <period> just  a  couple  weeks  ago  at  facebook <comma> we  hosted  a  very  senior  government  official <comma> and  he  came  in  to  meet  with  senior  execs  from  around  silicon  valley <period> and  everyone  kind  of  sat  at  the  table <period> and  then  he  had  these  two  women  who  were  traveling  with  him  who  were  pretty  senior  in  his  department <period> and  i  kind  of  said  to  them <comma> sit  at  the  table <period> come  on <comma> sit  at  the  table <period> and  they  sat  on  the  side  of  the  room <period> when  i  was  in  college  my  senior  year <comma> i  took  a  course  called  european  intellectual  history <period> do  n't  you  love  that  kind  of  thing  from  college <questionmark> i  wish  i  could  do  that  now <period> and  i  took  it  with  my  roommate <comma> carrie <comma> who  was  then  a  brilliant  literary  student <comma> and  went  on  to  be  a  brilliant  literary  scholar <comma> and  my  brother <comma> smart  guy <comma> but  a  water-polo-playing  pre-med <comma> who  was  a  sophomore <period> the  three  of  us  take  this  class  together <period> and  then  carrie  reads  all  the  books  in  the  original  greek  and  latin <comma> goes  to  all  the  lectures <period> i  read  all  the  books  in  english  and  go  to  most  of  the  lectures <period> my  brother  is  kind  of  busy <period> he  reads  one  book  of  12  and  goes  to  a  couple  of  lectures <comma> marches  himself  up  to  our  room  a  couple  days  before  the  exam  to  get  himself  tutored <period> the  three  of  us  go  to  the  exam  together <comma> and  we  sit  down <period> and  we  sit  there  for  three  hours <comma> and  our  little  blue  notebooks <comma> yes <comma> i  'm  that  old <period> and  we  walk  out <comma> and  we  look  at  each  other <comma> and  we  say <comma> how  did  you  do <questionmark> and  carrie  says <comma> boy <comma> i  feel  like  i  did  n't  really  draw  out  the  main  point  on  the  hegelian  dialectic <period> and  i  say <comma> god <comma> i  really  wish  i  had  really  connected  john  locke  's  theory  of  property  with  the  philosophers  who  follow <period> and  my  brother  says <comma> i  got  the  top  grade  in  the  class <period> you  got  the  top  grade  in  the  class <questionmark> you  do  n't  know  anything <period> the  problem  with  these  stories  is  that  they  show  what  the  data  shows <comma> women  systematically  underestimate  their  own  abilities <period> if  you  test  men  and  women <comma> and  you  ask  them  questions  on  totally  objective  criteria  like  gpas <comma> men  get  it  wrong  slightly  high <comma> and  women  get  it  wrong  slightly  low <period> women  do  not  negotiate  for  themselves  in  the  workforce <period> a  study  in  the  last  two  years  of  people  entering  the  workforce  out  of  college  showed  that  57  percent  of  boys  entering <comma> or  men <comma> i  guess <comma> are  negotiating  their  first  salary <comma> and  only  seven  percent  of  women <period> and  most  importantly <comma> men  attribute  their  success  to  themselves <comma> and  women  attribute  it  to  other  external  factors <period> if  you  ask  men  why  they  did  a  good  job <comma> they  'll  say <comma> i  'm  awesome <period> obviously <period> why  are  you  even  asking <questionmark> if  you  ask  women  why  they  did  a  good  job <comma> what  they  'll  say  is  someone  helped  them <comma> they  got  lucky <comma> they  worked  really  hard <period> why  does  this  matter <questionmark> boy <comma> it  matters  a  lot  because  no  one  gets  to  the  corner  office  by  sitting  on  the  side <comma> not  at  the  table <period> and  no  one  gets  the  promotion  if  they  do  n't  think  they  deserve  their  success <period> or  they  do  n't  even  understand  their  own  success <period> i  wish  the  answer  were  easy <period> i  wish  i  could  just  go  tell  all  the  young  women  i  work  for <comma> all  these  fabulous  women <comma> believe  in  yourself  and  negotiate  for  yourself <period> own  your  own  success <period> i  wish  i  could  tell  that  to  my  daughter <period> but  it  's  not  that  simple <period> because  what  the  data  shows <comma> above  all  else <comma> is  one  thing <comma> which  is  that  success  and  likeability  are  positively  correlated  for  men  and  negatively  correlated  for  women <period> and  everyone  's  nodding <comma> because  we  all  know  this  to  be  true <period> there  's  a  really  good  study  that  shows  this  really  well <period> there  's  a  famous  harvard  business  school  study  on  a  woman  named  heidi  roizen <period> and  she  's  an  operator  in  a  company  in  silicon  valley <comma> and  she  uses  her  contacts  to  become  a  very  successful  venture  capitalist <period> in  2002 <comma> not  so  long  ago <comma> a  professor  who  was  then  at  columbia  university  took  that  case  and  made  it  howard  roizen <period> and  he  gave  the  case  out <comma> both  of  them <comma> to  two  groups  of  students <period> he  changed  exactly  one  word <comma> heidi  to  howard <period> but  that  one  word  made  a  really  big  difference <period> he  then  surveyed  the  students <period> and  the  good  news  was  the  students <comma> both  men  and  women <comma> thought  heidi  and  howard  were  equally  competent <period> and  that  's  good <period> the  bad  news  was  that  everyone  liked  howard <period> he  's  a  great  guy <period> you  want  to  work  for  him <period> you  want  to  spend  the  day  fishing  with  him <period> but  heidi <questionmark> not  so  sure <period> she  's  a  little  out  for  herself <period> she  's  a  little  political <period> you  're  not  sure  you'd  want  to  work  for  her <period> this  is  the  complication <period> we  have  to  tell  our  daughters  and  our  colleagues <comma> we  have  to  tell  ourselves  to  believe  we  got  the  a <comma> to  reach  for  the  promotion <comma> to  sit  at  the  table <period> and  we  have  to  do  it  in  a  world  where <comma> for  them <comma> there  are  sacrifices  they  will  make  for  that <comma> even  though  for  their  brothers <comma> there  are  not <period> the  saddest  thing  about  all  of  this  is  that  it  's  really  hard  to  remember  this <period> and  i  'm  about  to  tell  a  story  which  is  truly  embarrassing  for  me <comma> but  i  think  important <period> i  gave  this  talk  at  facebook  not  so  long  ago  to  about  100  employees <period> and  a  couple  hours  later <comma> there  was  a  young  woman  who  works  there  sitting  outside  my  little  desk <comma> and  she  wanted  to  talk  to  me <period> i  said <comma> okay <comma> and  she  sat  down <comma> and  we  talked <period> and  she  said <comma> i  learned  something  today <period> i  learned  that  i  need  to  keep  my  hand  up <period> i  said <comma> what  do  you  mean <questionmark> she  said <comma> well <comma> you  're  giving  this  talk <comma> and  you  said  you  were  going  to  take  two  more  questions <period> and  i  had  my  hand  up  with  lots  of  other  people <comma> and  you  took  two  more  questions <period> and  i  put  my  hand  down <comma> and  i  noticed  all  the  women  put  their  hand  down <period> and  then  you  took  more  questions <comma> only  from  the  men <period> and  i  thought  to  myself <comma> wow <comma> if  it  's  me <comma> who  cares  about  this <comma> obviously <comma> giving  this  talk <comma> and  during  this  talk <comma> i  cannot  even  notice  that  the  men  's  hands  are  still  raised <comma> and  the  women  's  hands  are  still  raised <comma> how  good  are  we  as  managers  of  our  companies  and  our  organizations  at  seeing  that  the  men  are  reaching  for  opportunities  more  than  women <questionmark> we've  got  to  get  women  to  sit  at  the  table <period> message  number  two <comma> make  your  partner  a  real  partner <period> i've  become  convinced  that  we've  made  more  progress  in  the  workforce  than  we  have  in  the  home <period> the  data  shows  this  very  clearly <period> if  a  woman  and  a  man  work  full-time  and  have  a  child <comma> the  woman  does  twice  the  amount  of  housework  the  man  does <comma> and  the  woman  does  three  times  the  amount  of  childcare  the  man  does <period> so  she  's  got  three  jobs  or  two  jobs <comma> and  he  's  got  one <period> who  do  you  think  drops  out  when  someone  needs  to  be  home  more <questionmark> the  causes  of  this  are  really  complicated <comma> and  i  do  n't  have  time  to  go  into  them <period> and  i  do  n't  think  sunday  football-watching  and  general  laziness  is  the  cause <period> i  think  the  cause  is  more  complicated <period> i  think <comma> as  a  society <comma> we  put  more  pressure  on  our  boys  to  succeed  than  we  do  on  our  girls <period> i  know  men  that  stay  home  and  work  in  the  home  to  support  wives  with  careers <period> and  it  's  hard <period> when  i  go  to  the  mommy-and-me  stuff  and  i  see  the  father  there <comma> i  notice  that  the  other  mommies  do  n't  play  with  him <period> and  that  's  a  problem <comma> because  we  have  to  make  it  as  important  a  job <comma> because  it  's  the  hardest  job  in  the  world  to  work  inside  the  home <comma> for  people  of  both  genders <comma> if  we  're  going  to  even  things  out  and  let  women  stay  in  the  workforce <period> studies  show  that  households  with  equal  earning  and  equal  responsibility  also  have  half  the  divorce  rate <period> and  if  that  was  n't  good  enough  motivation  for  everyone  out  there <comma> they  also  have  more <comma> how  shall  i  say  this  on  this  stage <comma> they  know  each  other  more  in  the  biblical  sense  as  well <period> message  number  three <comma> do  n't  leave  before  you  leave <period> i  think  there  's  a  really  deep  irony  to  the  fact  that  actions  women  are  taking <comma> and  i  see  this  all  the  time <comma> with  the  objective  of  staying  in  the  workforce  actually  lead  to  their  eventually  leaving <period> here  's  what  happens <comma> we  're  all  busy <period> everyone  's  busy <period> a  woman  's  busy <period> and  she  starts  thinking  about  having  a  child <period> and  from  the  moment  she  starts  thinking  about  having  a  child <comma> she  starts  thinking  about  making  room  for  that  child <period> how  am  i  going  to  fit  this  into  everything  else  i  'm  doing <questionmark> and  literally  from  that  moment <comma> she  does  n't  raise  her  hand  anymore <comma> she  does  n't  look  for  a  promotion <comma> she  does  n't  take  on  the  new  project <comma> she  does  n't  say <comma> me <period> i  want  to  do  that <period> she  starts  leaning  back <period> the  problem  is  that <comma> let  's  say  she  got  pregnant  that  day <comma> that  day <comma> nine  months  of  pregnancy <comma> three  months  of  maternity  leave <comma> six  months  to  catch  your  breath <comma> fast-forward  two  years <comma> more  often <comma> and  as  i've  seen  it <comma> women  start  thinking  about  this  way  earlier <comma> when  they  get  engaged <comma> when  they  get  married <comma> when  they  start  thinking  about  trying  to  have  a  child <comma> which  can  take  a  long  time <period> one  woman  came  to  see  me  about  this <comma> and  i  kind  of  looked  at  her <comma> she  looked  a  little  young <period> and  i  said <comma> so  are  you  and  your  husband  thinking  about  having  a  baby <questionmark> and  she  said <comma> oh  no <comma> i  'm  not  married <period> she  did  n't  even  have  a  boyfriend <period> i  said <comma> you  're  thinking  about  this  just  way  too  early <period> but  the  point  is  that  what  happens  once  you  start  kind  of  quietly  leaning  back <questionmark> everyone  who  's  been  through  this <comma> and  i  'm  here  to  tell  you <comma> once  you  have  a  child  at  home <comma> your  job  better  be  really  good  to  go  back <comma> because  it  's  hard  to  leave  that  kid  at  home <comma> your  job  needs  to  be  challenging <period> it  needs  to  be  rewarding <period> you  need  to  feel  like  you  're  making  a  difference <period> and  if  two  years  ago  you  did  n't  take  a  promotion  and  some  guy  next  to  you  did <comma> if  three  years  ago  you  stopped  looking  for  new  opportunities <comma> you  're  going  to  be  bored  because  you  should  have  kept  your  foot  on  the  gas  pedal <period> do  n't  leave  before  you  leave <period> stay  in <period> keep  your  foot  on  the  gas  pedal <comma> until  the  very  day  you  need  to  leave  to  take  a  break  for  a  child <comma> and  then  make  your  decisions <period> do  n't  make  decisions  too  far  in  advance <comma> particularly  ones  you  're  not  even  conscious  you  're  making <period> my  generation  really <comma> sadly <comma> is  not  going  to  change  the  numbers  at  the  top <period> they  're  just  not  moving <period> we  are  not  going  to  get  to  where  50  percent  of  the  population <comma> in  my  generation <comma> there  will  not  be  50  percent  of  women  at  the  top  of  any  industry <period> but  i  'm  hopeful  that  future  generations  can <period> i  think  a  world  that  was  run  where  half  of  our  countries  and  half  of  our  companies  were  run  by  women <comma> would  be  a  better  world <period> and  it  's  not  just  because  people  would  know  where  the  women  's  bathrooms  are <comma> even  though  that  would  be  very  helpful <period> i  think  it  would  be  a  better  world <period> i  have  two  children <period> i  have  a  five-year-old  son  and  a  two-year-old  daughter <period> i  want  my  son  to  have  a  choice  to  contribute  fully  in  the  workforce  or  at  home <comma> and  i  want  my  daughter  to  have  the  choice  to  not  just  succeed <comma> but  to  be  liked  for  her  accomplishments <period> thank  you <period> /transcript <period> well <comma> good  morning <period> you  know <comma> the  computer  and  television  both  recently  turned  60 <comma> and  today  i'd  like  to  talk  about  their  relationship <period> despite  their  middle  age <comma> if  you've  been  following  the  themes  of  this  conference  or  the  entertainment  industry <comma> it  's  pretty  clear  that  one  has  been  picking  on  the  other <period> so  it  's  about  time  that  we  talked  about  how  the  computer  ambushed  television <period> or  why  the  invention  of  the  atomic  bomb  unleashed  forces  that  lead  to  the  writers  strike <period> and  it  's  not  just  what  these  are  doing  to  each  other <comma> but  it  's  what  the  audience  thinks  that  really  frames  this  matter <period> to  get  a  sense  of  this <comma> and  it  's  been  a  theme  we've  talked  about  all  week <comma> i  recently  talked  to  a  bunch  of  tweeners <period> i  wrote  on  cards <comma> television <comma> radio <comma> myspace <comma> internet <comma> pc <period> and  i  said <comma> just  arrange  these <comma> from  what  's  important  to  you  and  what  's  not <comma> and  then  tell  me  why <period> let  's  listen  to  what  happens  when  they  get  to  the  portion  of  the  discussion  on  television <period> girl  1 <comma> well <comma> i  think  it  's  important  but <comma> like <comma> not  necessary  because  you  can  do  a  lot  of  other  stuff  with  your  free  time  than  watch  programs <period> peter  hirshberg <comma> which  is  more  fun <comma> internet  or  tv <questionmark> girls <comma> internet <period> girl  2 <comma> i  think  we <comma> the  reasons <comma> one  of  the  reasons  we  put  computer  before  tv  is  because  nowadays <comma> like <comma> we  have  tv  shows  on  the  computer <period> girl  2 <comma> and  then  you  can  download  onto  your  ipod <period> ph <comma> would  you  like  to  be  the  president  of  a  tv  network <questionmark> girl  4 <comma> i  would  n't  like  it <period> girl  2 <comma> that  would  be  so  stressful <period> girl  5 <comma> no <period> ph <comma> how  come <questionmark> girl  5 <comma> because  they  're  going  to  lose  all  their  money  eventually <period> girl  3 <comma> like  the  stock  market <comma> it  goes  up  and  down  and  stuff <period> i  think  right  now  the  computers  will  be  at  the  top  and  everything  will  be  kind  of  going  down  and  stuff <period> ph <comma> there  's  been  an  uneasy  relationship  between  the  tv  business  and  the  tech  business <comma> really  ever  since  they  both  turned  about  30 <period> we  go  through  periods  of  enthrallment <comma> followed  by  reactions  in  boardrooms <comma> in  the  finance  community  best  characterized  as <comma> what  's  the  finance  term <questionmark> ick  pooey <period> let  me  give  you  an  example  of  this <period> the  year  is  1976 <comma> and  warner  buys  atari  because  video  games  are  on  the  rise <period> the  next  year  they  march  forward  and  they  introduce  qube <comma> the  first  interactive  cable  tv  system <comma> and  the  new  york  times  heralds  this  as  telecommunications  moving  to  the  home <comma> convergence <comma> great  things  are  happening <period> everybody  in  the  east  coast  gets  in  the  pictures <comma> citicorp <comma> penney <comma> rca <comma> all  getting  into  this  big  vision <period> by  the  way <comma> this  is  about  when  i  enter  the  picture <period> i  'm  going  to  do  a  summer  internship  at  time  warner <period> that  summer  i  'm  all <comma> i  'm  at  warner  that  summer <comma> i  'm  all  excited  to  work  on  convergence <comma> and  then  the  bottom  falls  out <period> does  n't  work  out  too  well  for  them <comma> they  lose  money <period> and  i  had  a  happy  brush  with  convergence  until <comma> kind  of <comma> warner  basically  has  to  liquidate  the  whole  thing <period> that  's  when  i  leave  graduate  school <comma> and  i  cannot  work  in  new  york  on  kind  of  entertainment  and  technology  because  i  have  to  be  exiled  to  california <comma> where  the  remaining  jobs  are <comma> almost  to  the  sea <comma> to  go  to  work  for  apple  computer <period> warner <comma> of  course <comma> writes  off  more  than  400  million  dollars <period> four  hundred  million  dollars <comma> which  was  real  money  back  in  the  70s <period> but  they  were  onto  something  and  they  got  better  at  it <period> by  the  year  2000 <comma> the  process  was  perfected <period> they  merged  with  aol <comma> and  in  just  four  years <comma> managed  to  shed  about  200  billion  dollars  of  market  capitalization <comma> showing  that  they'd  actually  mastered  the  art  of  applying  moore  's  law  of  successive  miniaturization  to  their  balance  sheet <period> now <comma> i  think  that  one  reason  that  the  media  and  the  entertainment  communities <comma> or  the  media  community <comma> is  driven  so  crazy  by  the  tech  community  is  that  tech  folks  talk  differently <period> you  know <comma> for  50  years <comma> we've  talked  about  changing  the  world <comma> about  total  transformation <period> for  50  years <comma> it  's  been  about  hopes  and  fears  and  promises  of  a  better  world <period> and  i  got  to  thinking <comma> you  know <comma> who  else  talks  that  way <questionmark> and  the  answer  is  pretty  clearly <comma> it  's  people  in  religion  and  in  politics <period> and  so  i  realized  that  actually  the  tech  world  is  best  understood <comma> not  as  a  business  cycle <comma> but  as  a  messianic  movement <period> we  promise  something  great <comma> we  evangelize  it <comma> we  're  going  to  change  the  world <period> it  does  n't  work  out  too  well <comma> and  so  we  actually  go  back  to  the  well  and  start  all  over  again <comma> as  the  people  in  new  york  and  la <period> look  on  in  absolute <comma> morbid  astonishment <period> but  it  's  this  irrational  view  of  things  that  drives  us  on  to  the  next  thing <period> so <comma> what  i'd  like  to  ask  is <comma> if  the  computer  is  becoming  a  principal  tool  of  media  and  entertainment <comma> how  did  we  get  here <questionmark> i  mean <comma> how  did  a  machine  that  was  built  for  accounting  and  artillery  morph  into  media <questionmark> of  course <comma> the  first  computer  was  built  just  after  world  war  ii  to  solve  military  problems <comma> but  things  got  really  interesting  just  a  couple  of  years  later <comma> 1949  with  whirlwind <period> built  at  mit  's  lincoln  lab <period> jay  forrester  was  building  this  for  the  navy <comma> but  you  cannot  help  but  see  that  the  creator  of  this  machine  had  in  mind  a  machine  that  might  actually  be  a  potential  media  star <period> so  take  a  look  at  what  happens  when  the  foremost  journalist  of  early  television  meets  one  of  the  foremost  computer  pioneers <comma> and  the  computer  begins  to  express  itself <period> journalist <comma> it  's  a  whirlwind  electronic  computer <period> with  considerable  trepidation <comma> we  undertake  to  interview  this  new  machine <period> jay  forrester <comma> hello  new  york <comma> this  is  cambridge <period> and  this  is  the  oscilloscope  of  the  whirlwind  electronic  computer <period> would  you  like  if  i  used  the  machine <questionmark> journalist <comma> yes <comma> of  course <period> but  i  have  an  idea <comma> mr.  forrester <period> since  this  computer  was  made  in  conjunction  with  the  office  of  naval  research <comma> why  do  n't  we  switch  down  to  the  pentagon  in  washington  and  let  the  navy  's  research  chief <comma> admiral  bolster <comma> give  whirlwind  the  workout <questionmark> calvin  bolster <comma> well <comma> ed <comma> this  problem  concerns  the  navy  's  viking  rocket <period> this  rocket  goes  up  135  miles  into  the  sky <period> now <comma> at  the  standard  rate  of  fuel  consumption <comma> i  would  like  to  see  the  computer  trace  the  flight  path  of  this  rocket  and  see  how  it  can  determine <comma> at  any  instant <comma> say  at  the  end  of  40  seconds <comma> the  amount  of  fuel  remaining <comma> and  the  velocity  at  that  set  instant <period> jf <comma> over  on  the  left-hand  side <comma> you  will  notice  fuel  consumption  decreasing  as  the  rocket  takes  off <period> and  on  the  right-hand  side <comma> there  's  a  scale  that  shows  the  rocket  's  velocity <period> the  rocket  's  position  is  shown  by  the  trajectory  that  we  're  now  looking  at <period> and  as  it  reaches  the  peak  of  its  trajectory <comma> the  velocity <comma> you  will  notice <comma> has  dropped  off  to  a  minimum <period> then <comma> as  the  rocket  dives  down <comma> velocity  picks  up  again  toward  a  maximum  velocity  and  the  rocket  hits  the  ground <period> how  's  that <questionmark> journalist <comma> what  about  that <comma> admiral <questionmark> cb <comma> looks  very  good  to  me <period> jf <comma> and  before  leaving <comma> we  would  like  to  show  you  another  kind  of  mathematical  problem  that  some  of  the  boys  have  worked  out  in  their  spare  time <comma> in  a  less  serious  vein <comma> for  a  sunday  afternoon <period> journalist <comma> thank  you  very  much  indeed <comma> mr.  forrester  and  the  mit  lab <period> ph <comma> you  know <comma> so  much  was  worked  out <comma> the  first  real-time  interaction <comma> the  video  display <comma> pointing  a  gun <period> it  lead  to  the  microcomputer <comma> but  unfortunately <comma> it  was  too  pricey  for  the  navy <comma> and  all  of  this  would  have  been  lost  if  it  were  n't  for  a  happy  coincidence <period> enter  the  atomic  bomb <period> we  're  threatened  by  the  greatest  weapon  ever <comma> and  knowing  a  good  thing  when  it  sees  it <comma> the  air  force  decides  it  needs  the  biggest  computer  ever  to  protect  us <period> they  adapt  whirlwind  to  a  massive  air  defense  system <comma> deploy  it  all  across  the  frozen  north <comma> and  spend  nearly  three  times  as  much  on  this  computer  as  was  spent  on  the  manhattan  project  building  the  a-bomb  in  the  first  place <period> talk  about  a  shot  in  the  arm  for  the  computer  industry <period> and  you  can  imagine  that  the  air  force  became  a  pretty  good  salesman <period> here  's  their  marketing  video <period> narrator <comma> in  a  mass  raid <comma> high-speed  bombers  could  be  in  on  us  before  we  could  determine  their  tracks <period> and  then  it  would  be  too  late  to  act <period> we  cannot  afford  to  take  that  chance <period> it  is  to  meet  this  threat  that  the  air  force  has  been  developing  sage <comma> the  semi-automatic  ground  environment  system <comma> to  strengthen  our  air  defenses <period> this  new  computer <comma> built  to  become  the  nerve  center  of  a  defense  network <comma> is  able  to  perform  all  the  complex  mathematical  problems  involved  in  countering  a  mass  enemy  raid <period> it  is  provided  with  its  own  powerhouse  containing  large  diesel-driven  generators <comma> air-conditioning  equipment <comma> and  cooling  towers  required  to  cool  the  thousands  of  vacuum  tubes  in  the  computer <period> ph <comma> you  know <comma> that  one  computer  was  huge <period> there  's  an  interesting  marketing  lesson  from  it <comma> which  is  basically <comma> when  you  market  a  product <comma> you  can  either  say <comma> this  is  going  to  be  wonderful <comma> it  will  make  you  feel  better  and  enliven  you <period> or  there  's  one  other  marketing  proposition <comma> if  you  do  n't  use  our  product <comma> you  'll  die <period> this  is  a  really  good  example  of  that <period> this  had  the  first  pointing  device <period> it  was  distributed <comma> so  it  worked  out <comma> distributed  computing  and  modems <comma> so  all  these  things  could  talk  to  each  other <period> about  20  percent  of  all  the  nation  's  programmers  were  wrapped  up  in  this  thing <comma> and  it  led  to  an  awful  lot  of  what  we  have  today <period> it  also  used  vacuum  tubes <period> you  saw  how  huge  it  was <comma> and  to  give  you  a  sense  for  this <comma> because  we've  talked  a  lot  about  moore  's  law  and  making  things  small  at  this  conference <comma> so  let  's  talk  about  making  things  large <period> if  we  took  whirlwind  and  put  it  in  a  place  that  you  all  know <comma> say <comma> century  city <comma> it  would  fit  beautifully <period> you'd  kind  of  have  to  take  century  city  out <comma> but  it  could  fit  in  there <period> but  like <comma> let  's  imagine  we  took  the  latest  pentium  processor <comma> the  latest  core  2  extreme <comma> which  is  a  four-core  processor  that  intel  's  working  on <comma> it  will  be  our  laptop  tomorrow <period> to  build  that <comma> what  we'd  do  with  whirlwind  technology  is  we'd  have  to  take  up  roughly  from  the  10  to  mulholland <comma> and  from  the  405  to  la  cienega  just  with  those  whirlwinds <period> and  then <comma> the  92  nuclear  power  plants  that  it  would  take  to  provide  the  power  would  fill  up  the  rest  of  los  angeles <period> that  's  roughly  a  third  more  nuclear  power  than  all  of  france  creates <period> so <comma> the  next  time  they  tell  you  they  're  on  to  something <comma> clearly  they  're  not <period> so <comma> and  we  have  n't  even  worked  out  the  cooling  needs <period> but  it  gives  you  the  kind  of  power  that  people  have <comma> that  the  audience  has <comma> and  the  reasons  these  transformations  are  happening <period> all  of  this  stuff  starts  moving  into  industry <period> dec  kind  of  reduces  all  this  and  makes  the  first  mini-computer <period> it  shows  up  at  places  like  mit <comma> and  then  a  mutation  happens <period> spacewar <period> is  built <comma> the  first  computer  game <comma> and  all  of  a  sudden <comma> interactivity  and  involvement  and  passion  is  worked  out <period> actually <comma> many  mit  students  stayed  up  all  night  long  working  on  this  thing <comma> and  many  of  the  principles  of  gaming  today  were  worked  out <period> dec  knew  a  good  thing  about  wasting  time <period> it  shipped  every  one  of  its  computers  with  that  game <period> meanwhile <comma> as  all  of  this  is  happening <comma> by  the  mid-'50s <comma> the  business  model  of  traditional  broadcasting  and  cinema  has  been  busted  completely <period> a  new  technology  has  confounded  radio  men  and  movie  moguls  and  they  're  quite  certain  that  television  is  about  to  do  them  in <period> in  fact <comma> despair  is  in  the  air <period> and  a  quote  that  sounds  largely  reminiscent  from  everything  i've  been  reading  all  week <period> rca  had  david  sarnoff <comma> who  basically  commercialized  radio <comma> said  this <comma> i  do  n't  say  that  radio  networks  must  die <period> every  effort  has  been  made  and  will  continue  to  be  made  to  find  a  new  pattern <comma> new  selling  arrangements  and  new  types  of  programs  that  may  arrest  the  declining  revenues <period> it  may  yet  be  possible  to  eke  out  a  poor  existence  for  radio <comma> but  i  do  n't  know  how <period> and  of  course <comma> as  the  computer  industry  develops  interactively <comma> producers  in  the  emerging  tv  business  actually  hit  on  the  same  idea <period> and  they  fake  it <period> jack  berry <comma> boys  and  girls <comma> i  think  you  all  know  how  to  get  your  magic  windows  up  on  the  set <comma> you  just  get  them  out <period> first  of  all <comma> get  your  winky  dink  kits  out <period> put  out  your  magic  window  and  your  erasing  glove <comma> and  rub  it  like  this <period> that  's  the  way  we  get  some  of  the  magic  into  it <comma> boys  and  girls <period> then  take  it  and  put  it  right  up  against  the  screen  of  your  own  television  set <comma> and  rub  it  out  from  the  center  to  the  corners <comma> like  this <period> make  sure  you  keep  your  magic  crayons  handy <comma> your  winky  dink  crayons  and  your  erasing  glove <comma> because  you  'll  be  using  them  during  the  show  to  draw  like  that <period> you  all  set <questionmark> ok <comma> let  's  get  right  to  the  first  story  about  dusty  man <period> come  on  into  the  secret  lab <period> ph <comma> it  was  the  dawn  of  interactive  tv <comma> and  you  may  have  noticed  they  wanted  to  sell  you  the  winky  dink  kits <period> those  are  the  winky  dink  crayons <period> i  know  what  you  're  saying <period> pete <comma> i  could  use  any  ordinary  open-source  crayon <comma> why  do  i  have  to  buy  theirs <questionmark> i  assure  you <comma> that  's  not  the  case <period> turns  out  they  told  us  directly  that  these  are  the  only  crayons  you  should  ever  use  with  your  winky  dink  magic  window <comma> other  crayons  may  discolor  or  hurt  the  window <period> this  proprietary  principle  of  vendor  lock-in  would  go  on  to  be  perfected  with  great  success  as  one  of  the  enduring  principles  of  windowing  systems  everywhere <period> it  led  to  lawsuits <comma> federal  investigations <comma> and  lots  of  repercussions <comma> and  that  's  a  scandal  we  wo  n't  discuss  today <period> but  we  will  discuss  this  scandal <comma> because  this  man <comma> jack  berry <comma> the  host  of  winky  dink <comma> went  on  to  become  the  host  of  twenty  one <comma> one  of  the  most  important  quiz  shows  ever <period> and  it  was  rigged <comma> and  it  became  unraveled  when  this  man <comma> charles  van  doren <comma> was  outed  after  an  unnatural  winning  streak <comma> ending  berry  's  career <period> and  actually <comma> ending  the  career  of  a  lot  of  people  at  cbs <period> it  turns  out  there  was  a  lot  to  learn  about  how  this  new  medium  worked <period> and  50  years  ago <comma> if  you'd  been  at  a  meeting  like  this  and  were  trying  to  understand  the  media <comma> there  was  one  prophet  and  only  but  one  you  wanted  to  hear  from <comma> professor  marshall  mcluhan <period> he  actually  understood  something  about  a  theme  that  we've  been  discussing  all  week <period> it  's  the  role  of  the  audience  in  an  era  of  pervasive  electronic  communications <period> here  he  is  talking  from  the  1960s <period> marshall  mcluhan <comma> if  the  audience  can  become  involved  in  the  actual  process  of  making  the  ad <comma> then  it  's  happy <period> it  's  like  the  old  quiz  shows <period> they  were  great  tv  because  it  gave  the  audience  a  role <comma> something  to  do <period> they  were  horrified  when  they  discovered  they'd  really  been  left  out  all  the  time  because  the  shows  were  rigged <period> now <comma> then <comma> this  was  a  horrible  misunderstanding  of  tv  on  the  part  of  the  programmers <period> ph <comma> you  know <comma> mcluhan  talked  about  the  global  village <period> if  you  substitute  the  word  blogosphere <comma> of  the  internet  today <comma> it  is  very  true  that  his  understanding  is  probably  very  enlightening  now <period> let  's  listen  in  to  him <period> mm <comma> the  global  village  is  a  world  in  which  you  do  n't  necessarily  have  harmony <period> you  have  extreme  concern  with  everybody  else  's  business  and  much  involvement  in  everybody  else  's  life <period> it  's  a  sort  of  ann  landers  column  writ  large <period> and  it  does  n't  necessarily  mean  harmony  and  peace  and  quiet <comma> but  it  does  mean  huge  involvement  in  everybody  else  's  affairs <period> and  so  the  global  village  is  as  big  as  a  planet <comma> and  as  small  as  a  village  post  office <period> ph <comma> we  'll  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  him  later <period> we  're  now  right  into  the  1960s <period> it  's  the  era  of  big  business  and  data  centers  for  computing <period> but  all  that  was  about  to  change <period> you  know <comma> the  expression  of  technology  reflects  the  people  and  the  time  of  the  culture  it  was  built  in <period> and  when  i  say  that  code  expresses  our  hopes  and  aspirations <comma> it  's  not  just  a  joke  about  messianism <comma> it  's  actually  what  we  do <period> but  for  this  part  of  the  story <comma> i'd  actually  like  to  throw  it  to  america  's  leading  technology  correspondent <comma> john  markoff <period> john  markoff <comma> do  you  want  to  know  what  the  counterculture  in  drugs <comma> sex <comma> rock  n  roll  and  the  anti-war  movement  had  to  do  with  computing <questionmark> everything <period> it  all  happened  within  five  miles  of  where  i  'm  standing <comma> at  stanford  university <comma> between  1960  and  1975 <period> in  the  midst  of  revolution  in  the  streets  and  rock  and  roll  concerts  in  the  parks <comma> a  group  of  researchers  led  by  people  like  john  mccarthy <comma> a  computer  scientist  at  the  stanford  artificial  intelligence  lab <comma> and  doug  engelbart <comma> a  computer  scientist  at  sri <comma> changed  the  world <period> engelbart  came  out  of  a  pretty  dry  engineering  culture <comma> but  while  he  was  beginning  to  do  his  work <comma> all  of  this  stuff  was  bubbling  on  the  mid-peninsula <period> there  was  lsd  leaking  out  of  kesey  's  veterans  hospital  experiments  and  other  areas  around  the  campus <comma> and  there  was  music  literally  in  the  streets <period> the  grateful  dead  was  playing  in  the  pizza  parlors <period> people  were  leaving  to  go  back  to  the  land <period> there  was  the  vietnam  war <period> there  was  black  liberation <period> there  was  women  's  liberation <period> this  was  a  remarkable  place <comma> at  a  remarkable  time <period> and  into  that  ferment  came  the  microprocessor <period> i  think  it  was  that  interaction  that  led  to  personal  computing <period> they  saw  these  tools  that  were  controlled  by  the  establishment  as  ones  that  could  actually  be  liberated  and  put  to  use  by  these  communities  that  they  were  trying  to  build <period> and  most  importantly <comma> they  had  this  ethos  of  sharing  information <period> i  think  these  ideas  are  difficult  to  understand <comma> because  when  you  're  trapped  in  one  paradigm <comma> the  next  paradigm  is  always  like  a  science  fiction  universe <comma> it  makes  no  sense <period> the  stories  were  so  compelling  that  i  decided  to  write  a  book  about  them <period> the  title  of  the  book  is <comma> what  the  dormouse  said <comma> how  the  60s  counterculture  shaped  the  personal  computer  industry <period> the  title  was  taken  from  the  lyrics  to  a  jefferson  airplane  song <period> the  lyrics  go <comma> remember  what  the  dormouse  said <period> feed  your  head <comma> feed  your  head <comma> feed  your  head <period> ph <comma> by  this  time <comma> computing  had  kind  of  leapt  into  media  territory <comma> and  in  short  order  much  of  what  we  're  doing  today  was  imagined  in  cambridge  and  silicon  valley <period> here  's  the  architecture  machine  group <comma> the  predecessor  of  the  media  lab <comma> in  1981 <period> meanwhile <comma> in  california <comma> we  were  trying  to  commercialize  a  lot  of  this  stuff <period> hypercard  was  the  first  program  to  introduce  the  public  to  hyperlinks <comma> where  you  could  randomly  hook  to  any  kind  of  picture <comma> or  piece  of  text <comma> or  data  across  a  file  system <comma> and  we  had  no  way  of  explaining  it <period> there  was  no  metaphor <period> was  it  a  database <questionmark> a  prototyping  tool <questionmark> a  scripted  language <questionmark> heck <comma> it  was  everything <period> so  we  ended  up  writing  a  marketing  brochure <period> we  asked  a  question  about  how  the  mind  works <comma> and  we  let  our  customers  play  the  role  of  so  many  blind  men  filling  out  the  elephant <period> a  few  years  later <comma> we  then  hit  on  the  idea  of  explaining  to  people  the  secret  of <comma> how  do  you  get  the  content  you  want <comma> the  way  you  want  it  and  the  easy  way <questionmark> here  's  the  apple  marketing  video <period> james  burke <comma> you  'll  be  pleased  to  know <comma> i  'm  sure <comma> that  there  are  several  ways  to  create  a  hypercard  interactive  video <period> the  most  involved  method  is  to  go  ahead  and  produce  your  own  videodisc  as  well  as  build  your  own  hypercard  stacks <period> by  far  the  simplest  method  is  to  buy  a  pre-made  videodisc  and  hypercard  stacks  from  a  commercial  supplier <period> the  method  we  illustrate  in  this  video  uses  a  pre-made  videodisc  but  creates  custom  hypercard  stacks <period> this  method  allows  you  to  use  existing  videodisc  materials  in  ways  which  suit  your  specific  needs  and  interests <period> ph <comma> i  hope  you  realize  how  subversive  that  is <period> that  's  like  a  dick  cheney  speech <period> you  think  he  's  a  nice  balding  guy <comma> but  he  's  just  declared  war  on  the  content  business <period> find  the  commercial  stuff <comma> mash  it  up <comma> tell  the  story  your  way <period> now <comma> as  long  as  we  confine  this  to  the  education  market <comma> and  a  personal  matter  between  the  computer  and  the  file  system <comma> that  's  fine <comma> but  as  you  can  see <comma> it  was  about  to  leap  out  and  upset  jack  valenti  and  a  lot  of  other  people <period> by  the  way <comma> speaking  of  the  filing  system <comma> it  never  occurred  to  us  that  these  hyperlinks  could  go  beyond  the  local  area  network <period> a  few  years  later <comma> tim  berners-lee  worked  that  out <period> it  became  a  killer  app  of  links <comma> and  today <comma> of  course <comma> we  call  that  the  world  wide  web <period> now <comma> not  only  was  i  instrumental  in  helping  apple  miss  the  internet <comma> but  a  couple  of  years  later <comma> i  helped  bill  gates  do  the  same  thing <period> the  year  is  1993 <period> and  he  was  working  on  a  book  and  i  was  working  on  a  video  to  help  him  kind  of  explain  where  we  were  all  heading  and  how  to  popularize  all  this <period> we  were  plenty  aware  that  we  were  messing  with  media <comma> and  on  the  surface <comma> it  looks  like  we  predicted  a  lot  of  the  right  things <comma> but  we  also  missed  an  awful  lot <period> let  's  take  a  look <period> narrator <comma> the  pyramids <comma> the  colosseum <comma> the

<comma> and  kind  of  only  one  of  his  ideas  turned  out  to  have  been  the  right  early  idea <period> well <comma> you  know  where  we  're  going  on  from  here <period> we  come  into  the  era  of  the  dotcom <comma> the  world  wide  web <comma> and  i  do  n't  need  to  tell  you  about  that  because  we  all  went  through  that  bubble  together <period> but  when  we  emerge  from  this  and  what  we  call  web  20 <comma> things  actually  are  quite  different <period> and  i  think  it  's  the  reason  that  tv  's  so  challenged <period> if  internet  one  was  about  pages <comma> now  it  's  about  people <period> it  's  a  customer <comma> it  's  an  audience <comma> it  's  a  person  who  's  participating <period> it  's  the  formidable  thing  that  is  changing  entertainment  now <period> mm <comma> because  it  gave  the  audience  a  role <comma> something  to  do <period> ph <comma> in  my  own  company <comma> technorati <comma> we  see  something  like  67,000  blog  posts  an  hour  come  in <period> that  's  about  2,700  fresh <comma> connective  links  across  about  112  million  blogs  that  are  out  there <period> and  it  's  no  wonder  that  as  we  head  into  the  writers  strike <comma> odd  things  happen <period> you  know <comma> it  reminds  me  of  that  old  saw  in  hollywood <comma> that  a  producer  is  anyone  who  knows  a  writer <period> i  now  think  a  network  boss  is  anyone  who  has  a  cable  modem <period> but  it  's  not  a  joke <period> this  is  a  real  headline <period>

on  strike <comma> in  sympathy  with  the  television  writers <period> and  then  you  have  tv  guide <comma> a  fox  property <comma> which  is  about  to  sponsor  the  online  video  awards

you  online <questionmark> man <comma> but  i <comma> yeah <comma> i  think  there  's  an  opportunity <period> as  the  strike  continues <comma> there  's  an  opportunity  for  more  people  to

you  know <comma> i  'm  part  of  news  corporation  as  part  of  fox  entertainment  group <period> obviously <comma> we  hope  that  the  strike  is <comma> that  the  issues  are  resolved  as  quickly  as  possible <period> ph <comma> one  of  the  great  things  that  's  going  on  here  is  the  globalization  of  content  really  is  happening <period> here  is  a  clip  from  a  video <comma> from  a  piece  of  animation  that  was  written  by  a  writer  in  hollywood <comma> animation  worked  out  in  israel <comma> farmed  out  to  croatia  and  india <comma> and  it  's  now  an  international  series <period> narrator <comma> the  following  takes  place  between  the  minutes  of  2:15  pm <period> and  2:18  pm <period> in  the  months  preceding  the  presidential  primaries <period> voice  1 <comma> you  'll  have  to  stay  here  in  the  safe  house  until  we  get  word  the  terrorist  threat  is  over <period> voice  2 <comma> you  mean  we  'll  have  to  live  here <comma> together <questionmark> voice  2 <comma> well <comma> there  goes  the  neighborhood <period> ph <comma> the  company  that  created  this <comma> aniboom <comma> is  an  interesting  example  of  where  this  is  headed <period> traditional  tv  animation  costs <comma> say <comma> between  80,000  and  10,000  dollars  a  minute <period> they  're  producing  things  for  between  1,500  and  800  dollars  a  minute <period> and  they  're  offering  their  creators  30  percent  of  the  back  end <comma> in  a  much  more  entrepreneurial  manner <period> so <comma> it  's  a  different  model <period> what  the  entertainment  business  is  struggling  with <comma> the  world  of  brands  is  figuring  out <period> for  example <comma> nike  now  understands  that  nike  plus  is  not  just  a  device  in  its  shoe <comma> it  's  a  network  to  hook  its  customers  together <period> and  the  head  of  marketing  at  nike  says <comma> people  are  coming  to  our  site  an  average  of  three  times  a  week <period> we  do  n't  have  to  go  to  them  which  means  television  advertising  is  down  57  percent  for  nike <period> or <comma> as  nike  's  head  of  marketing  says <comma> we  're  not  in  the  business  of  keeping  media  companies  alive <period> we  're  in  the  business  of  connecting  with  consumers <period> and  media  companies  realize  the  audience  is  important  also <period> here  's  a  man  announcing  the  new  market  watch  from  dow  jones <comma> powered  100  percent  by  the  user  experience  on  the  home  page <comma> user-generated  content  married  up  with  traditional  content <period> it  turns  out  you  have  a  bigger  audience  and  more  interest  if  you  hook  up  with  them <period> or <comma> as  geoffrey  moore  once  told  me <comma> it  's  intellectual  curiosity  that  's  the  trade  that  brands  need  in  the  age  of  the  blogosphere <period> and  i  think  this  is  beginning  to  happen  in  the  entertainment  business <period> one  of  my  heroes  is  songwriter <comma> ally  willis <comma> who  just  wrote  the  color  purple  and  has  been  an  r  and <comma> rhythm  and  blues  writer <comma> and  this  is  what  she  said  about  where  songwriting  's  going <period> ally  willis <comma> where  millions  of  collaborators  wanted  the  song <comma> because  to  look  at  them  strictly  as  spam  is  missing  what  this  medium  is  about <period> ph <comma> so <comma> to  wrap  up <comma> i'd  love  to  throw  it  back  to  marshall  mcluhan <comma> who <comma> 40  years  ago <comma> was  dealing  with  audiences  that  were  going  through  just  as  much  change <comma> and  i  think  that <comma> today <comma> traditional  hollywood  and  the  writers  are  framing  this  perhaps  in  the  way  that  it  was  being  framed  before <period> but  i  do  n't  need  to  tell  you  this <comma> let  's  throw  it  back  to  him <period> narrator <comma> we  are  in  the  middle  of  a  tremendous  clash  between  the  old  and  the  new <period> mm <comma> the  medium  does  things  to  people  and  they  are  always  completely  unaware  of  this <period> they  do  n't  really  notice  the  new  medium  that  is  wrapping  them  up <period> they  think  of  the  old  medium <comma> because  the  old  medium  is  always  the  content  of  the  new  medium <comma> as  movies  tend  to  be  the  content  of  tv <comma> and  as  books  used  to  be  the  content <comma> novels  used  to  be  the  content  of  movies <period> and  so  every  time  a  new  medium  arrives <comma> the  old  medium  is  the  content <comma> and  it  is  highly  observable <comma> highly  noticeable <comma> but  the  real <comma> real  roughing  up  and  massaging  is  done  by  the  new  medium <comma> and  it  is  ignored <period> ph <comma> i  think  it  's  a  great  time  of  enthrallment <period> there  's  been  more  raw  dna  of  communications  and  media  thrown  out  there <period> content  is  moving  from  shows  to  particles  that  are  batted  back  and  forth <comma> and  part  of  social  communications <comma> and  i  think  this  is  going  to  be  a  time  of  great  renaissance  and  opportunity <period> and  whereas  television  may  have  gotten  beat  up <comma> what  's  getting  built  is  a  really  exciting  new  form  of  communication <comma> and  we  kind  of  have  the  merger  of  the  two  industries  and  a  new  way  of  thinking  to  look  at  it <period> thanks  very  much <period> i  want  to  talk  about  penguins  today <period> but  first <comma> i  want  to  start  by  saying  that  we  need  a  new  operating  system <comma> for  the  oceans  and  for  the  earth <period> when  i  came  to  the  galapagos  40  years  ago <comma> there  were  3,000  people  that  lived  in  the  galapagos <period> now  there  are  over  30,000 <period> there  were  two  jeeps  on  santa  cruz <period> now <comma> there  are  around  a  thousand  trucks  and  buses  and  cars  there <period> so  the  fundamental  problems  that  we  face  are  overconsumption  and  too  many  people <period> it  's  the  same  problems  in  the  galapagos <comma> except <comma> obviously <comma> it  's  worse  here <comma> in  some  ways <comma> than  other  places <period> because  we've  only  doubled  the  population  of  the  earth  since  the  1960s <comma> a  little  more  than  doubled  -- <period> but  we  have  67  billion  people  in  the  world <period> and  we  all  like  to  consume <period> and  one  of  the  major  problems  that  we  have  is  our  operating  system  is  not  giving  us  the  proper  feedback <period> we  're  not  paying  the  true  environmental  costs  of  our  actions <period> and  when  i  came  at  age  22  to  live  on  fernandina <comma> let  me  just  say <comma> that  i  had  never  camped  before <period> i  had  never  lived  alone  for  any  period  of  time <period> and  i'd  never  slept  with  sea  lions  snoring  next  to  me  all  night <period> but  moreover <comma> i'd  never  lived  on  an  uninhabited  island <period> punta  espinosa  is  where  i  lived  for  over  a  year <period> and  we  call  it  uninhabited  because  there  are  no  people  there <period> but  it  's  alive  with  life <period> it  's  hardly  uninhabited <period> so  a  lot  has  happened  in  the  last  40  years <period> and  what  i  learned  when  i  came  to  the  galapagos  is  the  importance  of  wild  places <comma> wild  things <comma> certainly  wildlife <comma> and  the  amazing  qualities  that  penguins  have <period> penguins  are  real  athletes: <period> they  can  swim  173  kilometers  in  a  day <period> they  can  swim  at  the  same  speed  day  and  night  -- <period> that  's  faster  than  any  olympic  swimmer <period> i  mean <comma> they  can  do  like  seven  kilometers  an  hour  and  sustain  it <period> but  what  is  really  amazing <comma> because  of  this  deepness  here <comma> emperor  penguins  can  go  down  more  than  500  meters <period> and  they  can  hold  their  breath  for  23  minutes <period> magellanic  penguins <comma> the  ones  that  i  work  on <comma> they  can  dive  to  about  90  meters  and  they  can  stay  down  for  about  46  minutes <period> humans <comma> without  fins <comma> 90  meters <comma> 35  minutes <period> and  i  doubt  anybody  in  this  room  could  really  hold  their  breath  for  35  minutes <period> you  have  to  train  to  be  able  to  do  that <period> so  penguins  are  amazing  athletes <period> the  other  thing  is <comma> i've  never  met  anybody  that  really  does  n't  say  that  they  like  penguins <period> they  're  comical <comma> they  walk  upright <comma> and <comma> of  course <comma> they  're  diligent <period> and <comma> more  importantly <comma> they  're  well-dressed <period> so  they  have  all  the  criteria  that  people  normally  like <period> but  scientifically <comma> they  're  amazing  because  they  're  sentinels <period> they  tell  us  about  our  world  in  a  lot  of  different  ways <comma> and  particularly  the  ocean <period> this  is  a  picture  of  a  galapagos  penguin  that  's  on  the  front  of  a  little  zodiac  here  in  the  galapagos <period> and  that  's  what  i  came  to  study <period> i  thought  i  was  going  to  study  the  social  behavior  of  galapagos  penguins <comma> but  you  already  know  penguins  are  rare <period> these  are  the  rarest  penguins  in  the  world <period> why  i  thought  i  was  going  to  be  able  to  do  that <comma> i  do  n't  know <period> but  the  population  has  changed  dramatically  since  i  was  first  here <period> when  i  counted  penguins  for  the  first  time  and  tried  to  do  a  census <comma> we  just  counted  all  the  individual  beaks  that  we  could  around  all  these  islands <period> we  counted  around  2,000 <comma> so  i  do  n't  know  how  many  penguins  there  really  are <comma> but  i  know  i  can  count  2,000 <period> if  you  go  and  do  it  now <comma> the  national  parks  count  about  500 <period> so  we  have  a  quarter  of  the  penguins  that  we  did  40  years  ago <period> and  this  is  true  of  most  of  our  living  systems <period> we  have  less  than  we  had  before <comma> and  most  of  them  are  in  fairly  steep  decline <period> and  i  want  to  just  show  you  a  little  bit  about  why <period> that  's  a  penguin  braying  to  tell  you  that  it  's  important  to  pay  attention  to  penguins <period> most  important  of  all <comma> i  did  n't  know  what  that  was  the  first  time  i  heard  it <period> and  you  can  imagine  sleeping  on  fernandina  your  first  night  there  and  you  hear  this  lonesome <comma> plaintful  call <period> i  fell  in  love  with  penguins <comma> and  it  certainly  has  changed  the  rest  of  my  life <period> what  i  found  out  i  was  studying  is  really  the  difference  in  how  the  galapagos  changes <comma> the  most  extreme  variation <period> you've  heard  about  these  el  ninos <comma> but  this  is  the  extreme  that  penguins  all  over  the  world  have  to  adapt  to <period> this  is  a  cold-water  event  called  la  nina <period> where  it  's  blue  and  it  's  green <comma> it  means  the  water  is  really  cold <period> and  so  you  can  see  this  current  coming  up <comma> in  this  case <comma> the  humboldt  current <comma> that  comes  all  the  way  out  to  the  galapagos  islands <period> and  this  deep  undersea  current <comma> the  cromwell  current <comma> that  upwells  around  the  galapagos <period> that  brings  all  the  nutrients: <period> when  this  is  cold  in  the  galapagos <comma> it  's  rich <comma> and  there  's  plenty  of  food  for  everyone <period> when  we  have  extreme  el  nino  events <comma> you  see  all  this  red <comma> and  you  see  no  green  out  here  around  the  galapagos <period> that  means  that  there  's  no  upwelling <comma> and  there  's  basically  no  food <period> so  it  's  a  real  desert  for  not  only  for  the  penguins  and  the  sea  lions  and  the  marine  iguanas <period> things  die  when  there  's  no  food <period> but  we  did  n't  even  know  that  that  affected  the  galapagos  when  i  went  to  study  penguins <period> and  you  can  imagine  being  on  an  island  hoping  you  're  going  to  see  penguins <comma> and  you  're  in  the  middle  of  an  el  nino  event  and  there  are  no  penguins <period> they  're  not  breeding <period> they  're  not  even  around <period> i  studied  marine  iguanas  at  that  point <period> but  this  is  a  global  phenomenon <comma> we  know  that <period> and  if  you  look  along  the  coast  of  argentina <comma> where  i  work  now <comma> at  a  place  called  punta  tombo <comma> the  largest  magellanic  penguin  colony  in  the  world  down  here  about  44  degrees  south  latitude <comma> you  see  that  there  's  great  variation  here <period> some  years <comma> the  cold  water  goes  all  the  way  up  to  brazil <comma> and  other  years <comma> in  these  la  nina  years <comma> it  does  n't <period> so  the  oceans  do  n't  always  act  together <period> they  act  differently <comma> but  that  is  the  kind  of  variation  that  penguins  have  to  live  with <comma> and  it  's  not  easy <period> so  when  i  went  to  study  the  magellanic  penguins <comma> i  did  n't  have  any  problems <period> there  were  plenty  of  them <period> this  is  a  picture  at  punta  tombo  in  february  showing  all  the  penguins  along  the  beach <period> i  went  there  because  the  japanese  wanted  to  start  harvesting  them  and  turning  them  into  high  fashion  golf  gloves <comma> protein  and  oil <period> fortunately <comma> nobody  has  harvested  any  penguins  and  we  're  getting  over  100,000  tourists  a  year  to  see  them <period> but  the  population  is  declining <period> and  it  's  declined  fairly  substantially <comma> about  21  percent  since  1987 <comma> when  i  started  these  surveys <comma> in  terms  of  number  of  active  nests <period> here <comma> you  can  see  where  punta  tombo  is <period> and  they  breed  in  incredibly  dense  colonies <period> we  know  this  because  of  long-term  science <comma> because  we  have  long-term  studies  there <period> and  science  is  important  in  informing  decision  makers <comma> and  also  in  changing  how  we  do  and  knowing  the  direction  of  change  that  we  're  going  in <period> and  so  we  have  this  penguin  project <period> the  wildlife  conservation  society  has  funded  me  along  with  a  lot  of  individuals  over  the  last  27  years  to  be  able  to  produce  these  kinds  of  maps <period> and  also <comma> we  know  that  it  's  not  only  galapagos  penguins  that  are  in  trouble <comma> but  magellanics  and  many  other  species  of  penguins <period> and  so  we  have  started  a  global  penguin  society  to  try  to  focus  on  the  real  plight  of  penguins <period> this  is  one  of  the  plights  of  penguins <comma> oil  pollution <period> penguins  do  n't  like  oil  and  they  do  n't  like  to  swim  through  oil <period> the  nice  thing  is <comma> if  you  look  down  here  in  argentina <comma> there  's  no  surface  oil  pollution  from  this  composite  map <period> but <comma> in  fact <comma> when  we  went  to  argentina <comma> penguins  were  often  found  totally  covered  in  oil <period> so  they  were  just  minding  their  own  business <period> they  ended  up  swimming  through  ballast  water  that  had  oil  in  it <period> because  when  tankers  carry  oil  they  have  to  have  ballast  at  some  point <comma> so  when  they  're  empty <comma> they  have  the  ballast  water  in  there <period> when  they  come  back <comma> they  actually  dump  this  oily  ballast  water  into  the  ocean <period> why  do  they  do  that <questionmark> because  it  's  cheaper <comma> because  they  do  n't  pay  the  real  environmental  costs <period> we  usually  do  n't <comma> and  we  want  to  start  getting  the  accounting  system  right  so  we  can  pay  the  real  cost <period> at  first <comma> the  argentine  government  said <comma> no <comma> there  's  no  way <period> you  cannot  find  oiled  penguins  in  argentina <period> we  have  laws <period> and  we  cannot  have  illegal  dumping <period> it  's  against  the  law <period> so  we  ended  up  spending  nine  years  convincing  the  government  that  there  were  lots  of  oiled  penguins <period> in  some  years <comma> like  this  year <comma> we  found  more  than  80  percent  of  the  adult  penguins  dead  on  the  beach  were  covered  in  oil <period> these  little  blue  dots  are  the  fledglings <comma> we  do  this  survey  every  march <comma> which  means  that  they  're  only  in  the  environment  from  january  until  march <comma> so  maybe  three  months  at  the  most  that  they  could  get  covered  in  oil <period> and  you  can  see <comma> in  some  years  over  60  percent  of  the  fledglings  were  oiled <period> eventually <comma> the  government  listened  and <comma> amazingly <comma> they  changed  their  laws <period> they  moved  the  tanker  lanes  40  kilometers  farther  off  shore <comma> and  people  are  not  doing  as  much  illegal  dumping <period> so  what  we  're  seeing  now  is  very  few  penguins  are  oiled <period> why  are  there  even  these  penguins  oiled <questionmark> because  we've  solved  the  problem  in  chubut  province <comma> which  is  like  a  state  in  argentina  where  punta  tombo  is <comma> so  that  's  about  1,000  kilometers  of  coastline <comma> but  we  have  n't  solved  the  problem  in  northern  argentina <comma> uruguay  and  brazil <period> so  now  i  want  to  show  you  that  penguins  are  affected <period> i  'm  just  going  to  talk  about  two  things <period> this  is  climate  change <period> now  this  has  really  been  a  fun  study  because  i  put  satellite  tags  on  the  back  of  these  magellanic  penguins <period> try  to  convince  donors  to  give  you  a  couple  thousand  dollars  to  glue  a  satellite  tag  on  the  back  of  penguins <period> but  we've  been  doing  this  now  for  more  than  a  decade  to  learn  where  they  go <period> we  thought  we  needed  a  marine  protected  area  of  about  30  kilometers <comma> and  then  we  put  a  satellite  tag  on  the  back  of  a  penguin <period> and  what  the  penguins  show  us <comma> and  these  are  all  the  little  dots  from  where  the  penguins  positions  were  for  penguins  in  incubation  in  2003  -- <period> and  what  you  see  is  some  of  these  individuals  are  going  800  kilometers  away  from  their  nests <period> so  that  means  as  their  mate  is  sitting  on  the  nest  incubating  the  eggs <comma> the  other  one  is  out  there  foraging <period> and  the  longer  they  have  to  stay  gone <comma> the  worse  condition  the  mate  is  in  when  the  mate  comes  back <period> and <comma> of  course <comma> all  of  this  then  leads  to  a  vicious  cycle  and  you  cannot  raise  a  lot  of  chicks <period> here  you  see  in  2003 <comma> these  are  all  the  dots  of  where  the  penguins  are <comma> they  were  raising  a  little  over  a  half  of  a  chick <period> here <comma> you  can  see  in  2006 <comma> they  raised  almost  three  quarters  of  a  chick  per  nest <period> and  you  can  see  that  they  're  closer  to  punta  tombo <period> they  're  not  going  as  far  away <period> this  past  year <comma> in  2009 <comma> you  can  see  that  they  're  now  raising  about  a  fourth  of  a  chick <period> and  some  of  these  individuals  are  going  more  than  900  kilometers  away  from  their  nests <period> so  it  's  kind  of  like  you  having  a  job  in  chicago <comma> and  then  you  get  transferred  to  st <period> louis <comma> and  your  mate  is  not  happy  about  this  because  you've  got  to  pay  airfare <comma> because  you  're  gone  longer <period> the  same  thing  's  true  for  penguins  as  well <period> and  they  're  going  about <comma> on  average  now <comma> 40  kilometers  farther  than  they  did  a  decade  ago <period> we  need  to  be  able  to  get  information  out  to  the  general  public <period> and  so  we  started  a  publication  with  the  society  for  conservation  that  we  think  presents  cutting-edge  science  in  a  new <comma> novel  way <comma> because  we  have  reporters  that  are  good  writers  that  actually  can  distill  the  information  and  make  it  accessible  to  the  general  public <period> so  if  you  're  interested  in  cutting-edge  science  and  smarter  conservation <comma> you  should  join  with  our  11  partners <comma> some  of  them  here  in  this  room <comma> like  the  nature  conservancy <comma> and  look  at  this  magazine  because  we  need  to  get  information  out  about  conservation  to  the  general  public <period> lastly  i  want  to  say  that  all  of  you <comma> probably <comma> have  had  some  relationship  at  some  time  in  your  life  with  a  dog <comma> a  cat <comma> some  sort  of  pet <comma> and  you  recognized  that  those  are  individuals <period> and  some  of  you  consider  them  almost  part  of  your  family <period> if  you  had  a  relationship  with  a  penguin <comma> you'd  see  it  in  the  same  sort  of  way <period> they  're  amazing  creatures  that  really  change  how  you  view  the  world  because  they  're  not  that  different  from  us: <period> they  're  trying  to  make  a  living <period> they  're  trying  to  raise  their  offspring <period> they  're  trying  to  get  on  and  survive  in  the  world <period> this  is  turbo  the  penguin <period> turbo  's  never  been  fed <period> he  met  us  and  got  his  name  because  he  started  standing  under  my  diesel  truck <comma> a  turbo  truck <comma> so  we  named  him  turbo <period> turbo  has  taken  to  knocking  on  the  door  with  his  beak <period> we  let  him  in  and  he  comes  in  here <period> and  i  just  wanted  to  show  you  what  happened  one  day  when  turbo  brought  in  a  friend <period> so  this  is  turbo <period> he  's  coming  up  to  one  of  my  graduate  students  and  flipper  patting <comma> which  he  would  do  to  a  female  penguin <period> and  you  can  see <comma> he  's  not  trying  to  bite <period> this  guy  has  never  been  in  before  and  he  's  trying  to  figure  out <comma> what  is  going  on <questionmark> what  is  this  guy  doing <questionmark> this  is  really  pretty  weird <period> and  you  'll  see  soon  that  my  graduate  student <period> and  you  see <comma> turbo  's  pretty  intent  on  his  flipper  patting <period> and  now  he  's  looking  at  the  other  guy <comma> saying <comma> you  are  really  weird <period> and  now  look  at  this <comma> not  friendly <period> so  penguins  really  differ  in  their  personalities  just  like  our  dogs  and  our  cats <period> we  're  also  trying  to  collect  our  information  and  become  more  technologically  literate <period> so  we  're  trying  to  put  that  in  computers  in  the  field <period> and  penguins  are  always  involved  in  helping  us  or  not  helping  us  in  one  way  or  another <period> this  is  a  radio  frequency  id  system <period> you  put  a  little  piece  of  rice  in  the  foot  of  a  penguin  that  has  a  barcode <comma> so  it  tells  you  who  it  is <period> it  walks  over  the  pad <comma> and  you  know  who  it  is <period> okay <comma> so  here  are  a  few  penguins  coming  in <period> see <comma> this  one  's  coming  back  to  its  nest <period> they  're  all  coming  in  at  this  time <comma> walking  across  there <comma> just  kind  of  leisurely  coming  in <period> here  's  a  female  that  's  in  a  hurry <period> she  's  got  food <period> she  's  really  rushing  back <comma> because  it  's  hot <comma> to  try  to  feed  her  chicks <period> and  then  there  's  another  fellow  that  will  leisurely  come  by <period> look  how  fat  he  is <period> he  's  walking  back  to  feed  his  chicks <period> then  i  realize  that  they  're  playing  king  of  the  box <period> this  is  my  box  up  here <comma> and  this  is  the  system  that  works <period> you  can  see  this  penguin <comma> he  goes  over <comma> he  looks  at  those  wires <comma> does  not  like  that  wire <period> he  unplugs  the  wire <period> we  have  no  data <period> so <comma> they  really  are  pretty  amazing  creatures <period> ok <period> most  important  thing  is <comma> only  you  can  change  yourself <period> and  only  you  can  change  the  world  and  make  it  better <comma> for  people  as  well  as  penguins <period> let  me  share  with  you  today  an  original  discovery <period> but  i  want  to  tell  it  to  you  the  way  it  really  happened  -- <period> not  the  way  i  present  it  in  a  scientific  meeting <comma> or  the  way  you'd  read  it  in  a  scientific  paper <period> it  's  a  story  about  beyond  biomimetics <comma> to  something  i  'm  calling  biomutualism <period> i  define  that  as  an  association  between  biology  and  another  discipline <period> where  each  discipline  reciprocally  advances  the  other <comma> but  where  the  collective  discoveries  that  emerge  are  beyond  any  single  field <period> now <comma> in  terms  of  biomimetics <comma> as  human  technologies  take  on  more  of  the  characteristics  of  nature <comma> nature  becomes  a  much  more  useful  teacher <period> engineering  can  be  inspired  by  biology  by  using  its  principles  and  analogies  when  they  're  advantageous <period> but  then  integrating  that  with  the  best  human  engineering <comma> ultimately  to  make  something  actually  better  than  nature <period> now <comma> being  a  biologist <comma> i  was  very  curious  about  this <period> these  are  gecko  toes <period> and  we  wondered  how  they  use  these  bizarre  toes  to  climb  up  a  wall  so  quickly <period> we  discovered  it <period> and  what  we  found  was  that  they  have  leaf-like  structures  on  their  toes <comma> with  millions  of  tiny  hairs  that  look  like  a  rug <period> and  each  of  those  hairs  has  the  worst  case  of  split-ends  possible <comma> about  100  to  1000  split  ends  that  are  nano-size <period> and  the  individual  has  2  billion  of  these  nano-size  split  ends <period> they  do  n't  stick  by  velcro  or  suction  or  glue <period> they  actually  stick  by  intermolecular  forces  alone <comma> van  der  waals  forces <period> and  i  'm  really  pleased  to  report  to  you  today  that  the  first  synthetic  self-cleaning <comma> dry  adhesive  has  been  made <period> from  the  simplest  version  in  nature <comma> one  branch <period> my  engineering  collaborator <comma> ron  fearing <comma> at  berkeley <comma> had  made  the  first  synthetic  version <period> and  so  has  my  other  incredible  collaborator <comma> mark  cutkosky <comma> at  stanford  -- <period> he  made  much  larger  hairs  than  the  gecko <comma> but  used  the  same  general  principles <period> and  here  is  its  first  test <period> that  's  kellar  autumn <comma> my  former  phd <period> student <comma> professor  now  at  lewis  and  clark <comma> literally  giving  his  first-born  child  up  for  this  test <period> more  recently <comma> this  happened <period> man <comma> this  the  first  time  someone  has  actually  climbed  with  it <period> narrator <comma> lynn  verinsky <comma> a  professional  climber <comma> who  appeared  to  be  brimming  with  confidence <period> lynn  verinsky <comma> honestly <comma> it  's  going  to  be  perfectly  safe <period> it  will  be  perfectly  safe <period> man <comma> how  do  you  know <questionmark> lynn  verinsky <comma> because  of  liability  insurance <period> narrator <comma> with  a  mattress  below  and  attached  to  a  safety  rope <comma> lynn  began  her  60-foot  ascent <period> lynn  made  it  to  the  top  in  a  perfect  pairing  of  hollywood  and  science <period> man <comma> so  you  're  the  first  human  being  to  officially  emulate  a  gecko <period> lynn  verinsky <comma> ha <period> wow <period> and  what  a  privilege  that  has  been <period> robert  full <comma> that  's  what  she  did  on  rough  surfaces <period> but  she  actually  used  these  on  smooth  surfaces <comma> two  of  them <comma> to  climb  up <comma> and  pull  herself  up <period> and  you  can  try  this  in  the  lobby <comma> and  look  at  the  gecko-inspired  material <period> now  the  problem  with  the  robots  doing  this  is  that  they  cannot  get  unstuck <comma> with  the  material <period> this  is  the  gecko  's  solution <period> they  actually  peel  their  toes  away  from  the  surface <comma> at  high  rates <comma> as  they  run  up  the  wall <period> well  i  'm  really  excited  today  to  show  you  the  newest  version  of  a  robot <comma> stickybot <comma> using  a  new  hierarchical  dry  adhesive <period> here  is  the  actual  robot <period> and  here  is  what  it  does <period> and  if  you  look <comma> you  can  see  that  it  uses  the  toe  peeling <comma> just  like  the  gecko  does <period> if  we  can  show  some  of  the  video <comma> you  can  see  it  climbing  up  the  wall <period> there  it  is <period> and  now  it  can  go  on  other  surfaces  because  of  the  new  adhesive  that  the  stanford  group  was  able  to  do  in  designing  this  incredible  robot <period> oh <period> one  thing  i  want  to  point  out  is <comma> look  at  stickybot <period> you  see  something  on  it <period> it  's  not  just  to  look  like  a  gecko <period> it  has  a  tail <period> and  just  when  you  think  you've  figured  out  nature <comma> this  kind  of  thing  happens <period> the  engineers  told  us <comma> for  the  climbing  robots <comma> that <comma> if  they  do  n't  have  a  tail <comma> they  fall  off  the  wall <period> so  what  they  did  was  they  asked  us  an  important  question <period> they  said <comma> well <comma> it  kind  of  looks  like  a  tail <period> even  though  we  put  a  passive  bar  there <period> do  animals  use  their  tails  when  they  climb  up  walls <questionmark> what  they  were  doing  was  returning  the  favor <comma> by  giving  us  a  hypothesis  to  test <comma> in  biology <comma> that  we  would  n't  have  thought  of <period> so  of  course <comma> in  reality <comma> we  were  then  panicked <comma> being  the  biologists <comma> and  we  should  know  this  already <period> we  said <comma> well <comma> what  do  tails  do <questionmark> well  we  know  that  tails  store  fat <comma> for  example <period> we  know  that  you  can  grab  onto  things  with  them <period> and  perhaps  it  is  most  well  known  that  they  provide  static  balance <period> it  can  also  act  as  a  counterbalance <period> so  watch  this  kangaroo <period> see  that  tail <questionmark> that  's  incredible <period> marc  raibert  built  a  uniroo  hopping  robot <period> and  it  was  unstable  without  its  tail <period> now  mostly  tails  limit  maneuverability <period> like  this  human  inside  this  dinosaur  suit <period> my  colleagues  actually  went  on  to  test  this  limitation <comma> by  increasing  the  moment  of  inertia  of  a  student <comma> so  they  had  a  tail <comma> and  running  them  through  and  obstacle  course <comma> and  found  a  decrement  in  performance <period> like  you'd  predict <period> but  of  course <comma> this  is  a  passive  tail <period> and  you  can  also  have  active  tails <period> and  when  i  went  back  to  research  this <comma> i  realized  that  one  of  the  great  ted  moments  in  the  past <comma> from  nathan <comma> we've  talked  about  an  active  tail <period> video <comma> myhrvold  thinks  tail-cracking  dinosaurs  were  interested  in  love <comma> not  war <period> robert  full <comma> he  talked  about  the  tail  being  a  whip  for  communication <period> it  can  also  be  used  in  defense <period> pretty  powerful <period> so  we  then  went  back  and  looked  at  the  animal <period> and  we  ran  it  up  a  surface <period> but  this  time  what  we  did  is  we  put  a  slippery  patch  that  you  see  in  yellow  there <period> and  watch  on  the  right  what  the  animal  is  doing  with  its  tail  when  it  slips <period> this  is  slowed  down  10  times <period> so  here  is  normal  speed <period> and  watch  it  now  slip <comma> and  see  what  it  does  with  its  tail <period> it  has  an  active  tail  that  functions  as  a  fifth  leg <period> and  it  contributes  to  stability <period> if  you  make  it  slip  a  huge  amount <comma> this  is  what  we  discovered <period> this  is  incredible <period> the  engineers  had  a  really  good  idea <period> and  then  of  course  we  wondered <comma> okay <comma> they  have  an  active  tail <comma> but  let  's  picture  them <period> they  're  climbing  up  a  wall <comma> or  a  tree <period> and  they  get  to  the  top  and  let  's  say  there  's  some  leaves  there <period> and  what  would  happen  if  they  climbed  on  the  underside  of  that  leaf <comma> and  there  was  some  wind <comma> or  we  shook  it <questionmark> and  we  did  that  experiment <comma> that  you  see  here <period> and  this  is  what  we  discovered <period> now  that  's  real  time <period> you  cannot  see  anything <period> but  there  it  is  slowed  down <period> what  we  discovered  was  the  world  's  fastest  air-righting  response <period> for  those  of  you  who  remember  your  physics <comma> that  's  a  zero-angular-momentum  righting  response <period> but  it  's  like  a  cat <period> you  know <comma> cats  falling <period> cats  do  this <period> they  twist  their  bodies <period> but  geckos  do  it  better <period> and  they  do  it  with  their  tail <period> so  they  do  it  with  this  active  tail  as  they  swing  around <period> and  then  they  always  land  in  the  sort  of  superman  skydiving  posture <period> okay <comma> now  we  wondered <comma> if  we  were  right <comma> we  should  be  able  to  test  this  in  a  physical  model <comma> in  a  robot <period> so  for  ted  we  actually  built  a  robot <comma> over  there <comma> a  prototype <comma> with  the  tail <period> and  we  're  going  to  attempt  the  first  air-righting  response  in  a  tail <comma> with  a  robot <period> if  we  could  have  the  lights  on  it <period> okay <comma> there  it  goes <period> and  show  the  video <period> there  it  is <period> and  it  works  just  like  it  does  in  the  animal <period> so  all  you  need  is  a  swing  of  the  tail  to  right  yourself <period> now <comma> of  course <comma> we  were  normally  frightened  because  the  animal  has  no  gliding  adaptations <comma> so  we  thought <comma> oh  that  's  okay <period> we  'll  put  it  in  a  vertical  wind  tunnel <period> we  'll  blow  the  air  up <comma> we  'll  give  it  a  landing  target <comma> a  tree  trunk <comma> just  outside  the  plexi-glass  enclosure <comma> and  see  what  it  does <period> so  we  did <period> and  here  is  what  it  does <period> so  the  wind  is  coming  from  the  bottom <period> this  is  slowed  down  10  times <period> it  does  an  equilibrium  glide <period> highly  controlled <period> this  is  sort  of  incredible <period> but  actually  it  's  quite  beautiful <comma> when  you  take  a  picture  of  it <period> and  it  's  better  than  that <comma> it <comma> just  in  the  slide <comma> maneuvers  in  mid-air <period> and  the  way  it  does  it <comma> is  it  takes  its  tail  and  it  swings  it  one  way  to  yaw  left <comma> and  it  swings  its  other  way  to  yaw  right <period> so  we  can  maneuver  this  way <period> and  then <comma> we  had  to  film  this  several  times  to  believe  this <comma> it  also  does  this <period> watch  this <period> it  oscillates  its  tail  up  and  down  like  a  dolphin <period> it  can  actually  swim  through  the  air <period> but  watch  its  front  legs <period> can  you  see  what  they  are  doing <questionmark> what  does  that  mean  for  the  origin  of  flapping  flight <questionmark> maybe  it  's  evolved  from  coming  down  from  trees <comma> and  trying  to  control  a  glide <period> stay  tuned  for  that <period> so  then  we  wondered <comma> can  they  actually  maneuver  with  this <questionmark> so  there  is  the  landing  target <period> could  they  steer  towards  it  with  these  capabilities <questionmark> here  it  is  in  the  wind  tunnel <period> and  it  certainly  looks  like  it <period> you  can  see  it  even  better  from  down  on  top <period> watch  the  animal <period> definitely  moving  towards  the  landing  target <period> watch  the  whip  of  its  tail  as  it  does  it <period> look  at  that <period> it  's  unbelievable <period> so  now  we  were  really  confused <period> because  there  are  no  reports  of  it  gliding <period> so  we  went <comma> oh  my  god <comma> we  have  to  go  to  the  field <comma> and  see  if  it  actually  does  this <period> completely  opposite  of  the  way  you'd  see  it  on  a  nature  film <comma> of  course <period> we  wondered <comma> do  they  actually  glide  in  nature <questionmark> well  we  went  to  the  forests  of  singapore  and  southeast  asia <period> and  the  next  video  you  see  is  the  first  time  we've  showed  this <period> this  is  the  actual  video <comma> not  staged <comma> a  real  research  video <comma> of  animal  gliding  down <period> there  is  a  red  trajectory  line <period> look  at  the  end  to  see  the  animal <period> but  then  as  it  gets  closer  to  the  tree <comma> look  at  the  close-up <period> and  see  if  you  can  see  it  land <period> so  there  it  comes  down <period> there  is  a  gecko  at  the  end  of  that  trajectory  line <period> you  see  it  there <questionmark> there <questionmark> watch  it  come  down <period> now  watch  up  there  and  you  can  see  the  landing <period> did  you  see  it  hit <questionmark> it  actually  uses  its  tail  too <period> just  like  we  saw  in  the  lab <period> so  now  we  can  continue  this  mutualism  by  suggesting  that  they  can  make  an  active  tail <period> and  here  is  the  first  active  tail <comma> in  the  robot <comma> made  by  boston  dynamics <period> so  to  conclude <comma> i  think  we  need  to  build  biomutualisms <comma> like  i  showed <comma> that  will  increase  the  pace  of  basic  discovery  in  their  application <period> to  do  this  though <comma> we  need  to  redesign  education  in  a  major  way <comma> to  balance  depth  with  interdisciplinary  communication <period> and  explicitly  train  people  how  to  contribute  to <comma> and  benefit  from  other  disciplines <period> and  of  course  you  need  the  organisms  and  the  environment  to  do  it <period> that  is <comma> whether  you  care  about  security <comma> search  and  rescue  or  health <comma> we  must  preserve  nature  's  designs <comma> otherwise  these  secrets  will  be  lost  forever <period> and  from  what  i  heard  from  our  new  president <comma> i  'm  very  optimistic <period> thank  you <period> amongst  all  the  troubling  deficits  we  struggle  with  today <comma> we  think  of  financial  and  economic  primarily <comma> the  ones  that  concern  me  most  is  the  deficit  of  political  dialogue <comma> our  ability  to  address  modern  conflicts  as  they  are <comma> to  go  to  the  source  of  what  they  're  all  about  and  to  understand  the  key  players  and  to  deal  with  them <period> we  who  are  diplomats <comma> we  are  trained  to  deal  with  conflicts  between  states  and  issues  between  states <period> and  i  can  tell  you <comma> our  agenda  is  full <period> there  is  trade <comma> there  is  disarmament <comma> there  is  cross-border  relations <period> but  the  picture  is  changing <comma> and  we  are  seeing  that  there  are  new  key  players  coming  onto  the  scene <period> we  loosely  call  them  groups <period> they  may  represent  social <comma> religious <comma> political <comma> economic <comma> military  realities <period> and  we  struggle  with  how  to  deal  with  them <period> the  rules  of  engagement <comma> how  to  talk <comma> when  to  talk <comma> and  how  to  deal  with  them <period> let  me  show  you  a  slide  here  which  illustrates  the  character  of  conflicts  since  1946  until  today <period> you  see  the  green  is  a  traditional  interstate  conflict <comma> the  ones  we  used  to  read  about <period> the  red  is  modern  conflict <comma> conflicts  within  states <period> these  are  quite  different <comma> and  they  are  outside  the  grasp  of  modern  diplomacy <period> and  the  core  of  these  key  actors  are  groups  who  represent  different  interests  inside  countries <period> and  the  way  they  deal  with  their  conflicts  rapidly  spreads  to  other  countries <period> so  in  a  way <comma> it  is  everybody  's  business <period> another  acknowledgment  we've  seen  during  these  years <comma> recent  years <comma> is  that  very  few  of  these  domestic  interstate <comma> intrastate  conflicts  can  be  solved  militarily <period> they  may  have  to  be  dealt  with  with  military  means <comma> but  they  cannot  be  solved  by  military  means <period> they  need  political  solutions <period> and  we <comma> therefore <comma> have  a  problem <comma> because  they  escape  traditional  diplomacy <period> and  we  have  among  states  a  reluctance  in  dealing  with  them <period> plus <comma> during  the  last  decade <comma> we've  been  in  the  mode  where  dealing  with  groups  was  conceptually  and  politically  dangerous <period> after  9/11 <comma> either  you  were  with  us  or  against  us <period> it  was  black  or  white <period> and  groups  are  very  often  immediately  label  terrorists <period> and  who  would  talk  to  terrorists <questionmark> the  west <comma> as  i  would  see  it <comma> comes  out  of  that  decade  weakened <comma> because  we  did  n't  understand  the  group <period> so  we've  spent  more  time  on  focusing  on  why  we  should  not  talk  to  others  than  finding  out  how  we  talk  to  others <period> now  i  'm  not  naive <period> you  cannot  talk  to  everybody  all  the  time <period> and  there  are  times  you  should  walk <period> and  sometimes  military  intervention  is  necessary <period> i  happen  to  believe  that  libya  was  necessary  and  that  military  intervention  in  afghanistan  was  also  necessary <period> and  my  country  relies  on  its  security  through  military  alliance <comma> that  's  clear <period> but  still  we  have  a  large  deficit  in  dealing  with  and  understanding  modern  conflict <period> let  us  turn  to  afghanistan <period> 10  years  after  that  military  intervention <comma> that  country  is  far  from  secure <period> the  situation <comma> to  be  honest <comma> is  very  serious <period> now  again <comma> the  military  is  necessary <comma> but  the  military  is  no  problem-solver <period> when  i  first  came  to  afghanistan  in  2005  as  a  foreign  minister <comma> i  met  the  commander  of  isaf <comma> the  international  troops <period> and  he  told  me  that <comma> this  can  be  won  militarily <comma> minister <period> we  just  have  to  persevere  now  four  com  isaf  's  later <comma> we  hear  a  different  message <comma> this  cannot  be  won  militarily <period> we  need  military  presence <comma> but  we  need  to  move  to  politics <period> we  can  only  solve  this  through  a  political  solution <period> and  it  is  not  us  who  will  solve  it <period> afghans  have  to  solve  it  but  then  they  need  a  different  political  process  than  the  one  they  were  given  in  2001 <comma> 2002 <period> they  need  an  inclusive  process  where  the  real  fabric  of  this  very  complicated  society  can  deal  with  their  issues <period> everybody  seems  to  agree  with  that <period> it  was  very  controversial  to  say  three <comma> four <comma> five  years  ago <period> now  everybody  agrees <period> but  now <comma> as  we  prepare  to  talk <comma> we  understand  how  little  we  know <period> because  we  did  n't  talk <period> we  did  n't  grasp  what  was  going  on <period> the  international  committee  of  the  red  cross <comma> the  icrc <comma> is  talking  to  everyone <comma> and  it  is  doing  so  because  it  is  neutral <period> and  that  's  one  reason  why  that  organization  probably  is  the  best  informed  key  player  to  understand  modern  conflict <comma> because  they  talk <period> my  point  is  that  you  do  n't  have  to  be  neutral  to  talk <period> and  you  do  n't  have  to  agree  when  you  sit  down  with  the  other  side <period> and  you  can  always  walk <period> but  if  you  do  n't  talk <comma> you  cannot  engage  the  other  side <period> and  the  other  side  which  you  're  going  to  engage  is  the  one  with  whom  you  profoundly  disagree <period> prime  minister  rabin  said  when  he  engaged  the  oslo  process <comma> you  do  n't  make  peace  with  your  friends <comma> you  make  peace  with  your  enemies  it  's  hard <comma> but  it  is  necessary <period> let  me  go  one  step  further <period> this  is  tahrir  square <period> there  's  a  revolution  going  on <period> the  arab  spring  is  heading  into  fall  and  is  moving  into  winter <period> it  will  last  for  a  long <comma> long  time <period> and  who  knows  what  it  will  be  called  in  the  end <period> that  's  not  the  point <period> the  point  is  that  we  are  probably  seeing <comma> for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  arab  world <comma> a  revolution  bottom-up <comma> people  's  revolution <period> social  groups  are  taking  to  the  streets <period> and  we  find  out  in  the  west  that  we  know  very  little  about  what  's  happening <period> because  we  never  talk  to  the  people  in  these  countries <period> most  governments  followed  the  dictate  of  the  authoritarian  leaders  to  stay  away  from  these  different  groups <comma> because  they  were  terrorists <period> so  now  that  they  are  emerging  in  the  street  and  we  salute  the  democratic  revolution <comma> we  find  out  how  little  we  know <period> right  now <comma> the  discussion  goes <comma> should  we  talk  to  the  muslim  brotherhood <questionmark> should  we  talk  to  hamas <questionmark> if  we  talk  to  them <comma> we  may  legitimize  them  i  think  that  is  wrong <period> if  you  talk  in  the  right  way <comma> you  make  it  very  clear  that  talking  is  not  agreeing <period> and  how  can  we  tell  the  muslim  brotherhood <comma> as  we  should <comma> that  they  must  respect  minority  rights <comma> if  we  do  n't  accept  majority  rights <questionmark> because  they  may  turn  out  to  be  a  majority <period> how  can  we  escape  having  a  double-standard <comma> if  we  at  the  same  time  preach  democracy  and  at  the  same  time  do  n't  want  to  deal  with  the  groups  that  are  representative <questionmark> how  will  we  ever  be  interlocutors <questionmark> now  my  diplomats  are  instructed  to  talk  to  all  these  groups <period> but  talking  can  be  done  in  different  ways <period> we  make  a  distinction  between  talking  from  a  diplomatic  level  and  talking  at  the  political  level <period> now  talking  can  be  accompanied  with  aid  or  not  with  aid <period> talking  can  be  accompanied  with  inclusion  or  not  inclusion <period> there  's  a  big  array  of  the  ways  of  dealing  with  this <period> so  if  we  refuse  to  talk  to  these  new  groups  that  are  going  to  be  dominating  the  news  in  years  to  come <comma> we  will  further  radicalization <comma> i  believe <period> we  will  make  the  road  from  violent  activities  into  politics  harder  to  travel <period> and  if  we  cannot  demonstrate  to  these  groups  that  if  you  move  towards  democracy <comma> if  you  move  towards  taking  part  in  civilized  and  normal  standards  among  states <comma> there  are  some  rewards  on  the  other  side <period> the  paradox  here  is  that  the  last  decade  probably  was  a  lost  decade  for  making  progress  on  this <period> and  the  paradox  is  that  the  decade  before  the  last  decade  was  so  promising <comma> and  for  one  reason  primarily <period> and  the  reason  is  what  happened  in  south  africa <comma> nelson  mandela <period> when  mandela  came  out  of  prison  after  27  years  of  captivity <comma> if  he  had  told  his  people <comma> it  's  time  to  take  up  the  arms <comma> it  's  time  to  fight <comma> he  would  have  been  followed <period> and  i  think  the  international  community  would  have  said <comma> fair  enough <period> it  's  their  right  to  fight  now  as  you  know <comma> mandela  did  n't  do  that <period> in  his  memoirs <comma> long  road  to  freedom <comma> he  wrote  that  he  survived  during  those  years  of  captivity  because  he  always  decided  to  look  upon  his  oppressor  as  also  being  a  human  being <comma> also  being  a  human  being <period> so  he  engaged  a  political  process  of  dialogue <comma> not  as  a  strategy  of  the  weak <comma> but  as  a  strategy  of  the  strong <period> and  he  engaged  talking  profoundly  by  settling  some  of  the  most  tricky  issues  through  a  truth  and  reconciliation  process  where  people  came  and  talked <period> now  south  african  friends  will  know  that  was  very  painful <period> so  what  can  we  learn  from  all  of  this <questionmark> dialogue  is  not  easy <comma> not  between  individuals <comma> not  between  groups <comma> not  between  governments <comma> but  it  is  very  necessary <period> if  we  're  going  to  deal  with  political  conflict-solving  of  conflicts <comma> if  we  're  going  to  understand  these  new  groups  which  are  coming  from  bottom-up <comma> supported  by  technology <comma> which  is  available  to  all <comma> we  diplomats  cannot  be  sitting  back  in  the  banquets  believing  that  we  are  doing  interstate  relations <period> we  have  to  connect  with  these  profound  changes <period> and  what  is  dialogue  really  about <questionmark> when  i  enter  into  dialogue <comma> i  really  hope  that  the  other  side  would  pick  up  my  points  of  view <comma> that  i  would  impress  upon  them  my  opinions  and  my  values <period> i  cannot  do  that  unless  i  send  the  signals  that  i  will  be  open  to  listen  to  the  other  side  's  signals <period> we  need  a  lot  more  training  on  how  to  do  that  and  a  lot  more  practice  on  how  that  can  take  problem-solving  forward <period> we  know  from  our  personal  experiences  that  it  's  easy  sometimes  just  to  walk <comma> and  sometimes  you  may  need  to  fight <period> and  i  would  n't  say  that  is  the  wrong  thing  in  all  circumstances <period> sometimes  you  have  to <period> but  that  strategy  seldom  takes  you  very  far <period> the  alternative  is  a  strategy  of  engagement  and  principled  dialogue <period> and  i  believe  we  need  to  strengthen  this  approach  in  modern  diplomacy <comma> not  only  between  states <comma> but  also  within  states <period> we  are  seeing  some  new  signs <period> we  could  never  have  done  the  convention  against  anti-personnel  landmines  and  the  convention  that  is  banning  cluster  munitions  unless  we  had  done  diplomacy  differently <comma> by  engaging  with  civil  society <period> all  of  a  sudden <comma> ngos  were  not  only  standing  in  the  streets <comma> crying  their  slogans <comma> but  they  were  taking  them  into  the  negotiations <comma> partly  because  they  represented  the  victims  of  these  weapons <period> and  they  brought  their  knowledge <period> and  there  was  an  interaction  between  diplomacy  and  the  power  coming  bottom-up <period> this  is  perhaps  a  first  element  of  a  change <period> in  the  future <comma> i  believe <comma> we  should  draw  examples  from  these  different  illustrations <comma> not  to  have  diplomacy  which  is  disconnected  from  people  and  civil  society <period> and  we  have  to  go  also  beyond  traditional  diplomacy  to  the  survival  issue  of  our  times <comma> climate  change <period> how  are  we  going  to  solve  climate  change  through  negotiations <comma> unless  we  are  able  to  make  civil  society  and  people <comma> not  part  of  the  problem <comma> but  part  of  the  solution <questionmark> it  is  going  to  demand  an  inclusive  process  of  diplomacy  very  different  from  the  one  we  are  practicing  today  as  we  are  heading  to  new  rounds  of  difficult  climate  negotiations <comma> but  when  we  move  toward  something  which  has  to  be  much  more  along  a  broad  mobilization <period> it  's  crucial  to  understand <comma> i  believe <comma> because  of  technology  and  because  of  globalization <comma> societies  from  bottom-up <period> we  as  diplomats  need  to  know  the  social  capital  of  communities <period> what  is  it  that  makes  people  trust  each  other <comma> not  only  between  states <comma> but  also  within  states <questionmark> what  is  the  legitimacy  of  diplomacy <comma> of  the  the  solution  we  devise  as  diplomats  if  they  cannot  be  reflected  and  understood  by  also  these  broader  forces  of  societies  that  we  now  very  loosely  call  groups <questionmark> the  good  thing  is  that  we  are  not  powerless <period> we  have  never  had  as  many  means  of  communication <comma> means  of  being  connected <comma> means  of  reaching  out <comma> means  of  including <period> the  diplomatic  toolbox  is  actually  full  of  different  tools  we  can  use  to  strengthen  our  communication <period> but  the  problem  is  that  we  are  coming  out  of  a  decade  where  we  had  a  fear  of  touching  it <period> now <comma> i  hope <comma> in  the  coming  years <comma> that  we  are  able  to  demonstrate  through  some  concrete  examples  that  fear  is  receding  and  that  we  can  take  courage  from  that  alliance  with  civil  society  in  different  countries  to  support  their  problem-solving <comma> among  the  afghans <comma> inside  the  palestinian  population <comma> between  the  peoples  of  palestine  and  israel <period> and  as  we  try  to  understand  this  broad  movement  across  the  arab  world <comma> we  are  not  powerless <period> we  need  to  improve  the  necessary  skills <comma> and  we  need  the  courage  to  use  them <period> in  my  country <comma> i  have  seen  how  the  council  of  islamist  groups  and  christian  groups  came  together <comma> not  as  a  government  initiative <comma> but  they  came  together  on  their  own  initiative  to  establish  contact  and  dialogue  in  times  where  things  were  pretty  low-key  tension <period> and  when  tension  increased <comma> they  already  had  that  dialogue <comma> and  that  was  a  strength  to  deal  with  different  issues <period> our  modern  western  societies  are  more  complex  than  before <comma> in  this  time  of  migration <period> how  are  we  going  to  settle  and  build  a  bigger  we  to  deal  with  our  issues  if  we  do  n't  improve  our  skills  of  communication <questionmark> so  there  are  many  reasons <comma> and  for  all  of  these  reasons <comma> this  is  time  and  this  is  why  we  must  talk <period> thank  you  for  your  attention <period> i  'm  often  asked <comma> what  surprises  you  about  the  book <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> that  i  got  to  write  it <period> i  would  have  never  imagined  that <comma> not  in  my  wildest  dreams  did  i  think <comma> i  do  n't  even  consider  myself  to  be  an  author <period> and  i  'm  often  asked <comma> why  do  you  think  so  many  people  have  read  this <questionmark> this  thing  's  selling  still  about  a  million  copies  a  month <period> and  i  think  it  's  because  spiritual  emptiness  is  a  universal  disease <period> i  think  inside  at  some  point <comma> we  put  our  heads  down  on  the  pillow  and  we  go <comma> there  's  got  to  be  more  to  life  than  this <period> get  up  in  the  morning <comma> go  to  work <comma> come  home  and  watch  tv <comma> go  to  bed <comma> get  up  in  the  morning <comma> go  to  work <comma> come  home <comma> watch  tv <comma> go  to  bed <comma> go  to  parties  on  weekends <period> a  lot  of  people  say <comma> i  'm  living  no <comma> you  're  not  living <comma> that  's  just  existing <period> just  existing <period> i  really  think  that  's  there  's  this  inner  desire <period> i  do  believe  what  chris  said <period> i  believe  that  you  're  not  an  accident <period> your  parents  may  not  have  planned  you <comma> but  i  believe  god  did <period> i  think  there  are  accidental  parents <period> there  's  no  doubt  about  that <period> i  do  n't  think  there  are  accidental  kids <period> and  i  think  you  matter <period> i  think  you  matter  to  god <period> i  think  you  matter  to  history <period> i  think  you  matter  to  this  universe <period> and  i  think  that  the  difference  between  what  i  call  the  survival  level  of  living <comma> the  success  level  of  living  and  the  significant  level  of  living  is <comma> do  you  figure  out <comma> what  on  earth  am  i  here  for <questionmark> i  meet  a  lot  of  people  who  are  very  smart <comma> and  say <comma> but  why  cannot  i  figure  out  my  problems <questionmark> and  i  meet  a  lot  of  people  who  are  very  successful <comma> who  say <comma> why  do  n't  i  feel  more  fulfilled <questionmark> why  do  i  feel  like  a  fake <questionmark> why  do  i  feel  like  i've  got  to  pretend  that  i  'm  more  than  i  really  am <questionmark> i  think  that  comes  down  to  this  issue  of  meaning <comma> of  significance <comma> of  purpose <period> i  think  it  comes  down  to  this  issue  of <comma> why  am  i  here <questionmark> what  am  i  here  for <questionmark> where  am  i  going <questionmark> these  are  not  religious  issues <comma> they  're  human  issues <period> i  wanted  to  tell  michael  before  he  spoke  that  i  really  appreciate  what  he  does <comma> because  it  makes  my  life  work  a  whole  lot  easier <period> as  a  pastor <comma> i  do  see  a  lot  of  kooks <period> and  i  have  learned  that  there  are  kooks  in  every  area  of  life <period> religion  does  n't  have  a  monopoly  on  that <comma> but  there  are  plenty  of  religious  kooks <period> there  are  secular  kooks <period> there  are  smart  kooks <comma> dumb  kooks <period> there  are  people <comma> a  lady  came  up  to  me  the  other  day <comma> and  she  had  a  white  piece  of  paper <comma> michael <comma> you  'll  like  this  one <comma> and  she  said <comma> what  do  you  see  in  it <questionmark> and  i  looked  at  it  and  i  said <comma> oh <comma> i  do  n't  see  anything <period> and  she  goes <comma> well <comma> i  see  jesus <comma> and  started  crying  and  left <period> i  'm  going <comma> ok <comma> you  know <period> fine <period> um <period> when  the  book  became  the  best-selling  book  in  the  world  for  the  last  three  years <comma> i  kind  of  had  my  little  crisis <period> and  that  was <comma> what  is  the  purpose  of  this <questionmark> because  it  brought  in  enormous  amounts  of  money <period> when  you  write  the  best-selling  book  in  the  world <comma> it  's  tons  and  tons  of  money  -- <period> and  it  brought  in  a  lot  of  attention <comma> neither  of  which  i  wanted <period> when  i  started  saddleback  church <comma> i  was  25  years  old <period> i  started  it  with  one  other  family  in  1980 <period> and  i  decided  that  i  was  never  going  to  go  on  tv <comma> because  i  did  n't  want  to  be  a  celebrity <comma> i  did  n't  want  to  be  a <comma> quote <comma> evangelist <comma> televangelist <comma> that  's  not  my  thing <period> and  all  of  a  sudden <comma> it  brought  a  lot  of  money  and  a  lot  of  attention <period> i  do  n't  think <comma> now <comma> this  is  a  worldview <comma> and  i  will  tell  you <comma> everybody  's  got  a  worldview <period> everybody  's  betting  their  life  on  something <period> you  're  betting  your  life  on  something <comma> you  just  better  know  why  you  're  betting  what  you  're  betting  on <period> so <comma> everybody  's  betting  their  life  on  something <comma> and  when  i <comma> you  know <comma> made  a  bet <comma> i  happened  to  believe  that  jesus  was  who  he  said  he  was <period> but  everybody  's  got <comma> and  i  believe  in  a  pluralistic  society <comma> everybody  's  betting  on  something <period> and  when  i  started  the  church <comma> you  know <comma> i  had  no  plans  to  do  what  it  's  doing  now <period> and  then  when  i  wrote  this  book <comma> and  all  of  a  sudden  it  just  took  off <comma> then  i  started  saying <comma> now <comma> what  's  the  purpose  of  this <questionmark> because  as  i  started  to  say <comma> i  do  n't  think  you  're  given  money  or  fame  for  your  own  ego <comma> ever <period> i  just  do  n't  believe  that <period> and  when  you  write  a  book  that  the  first  sentence  of  the  book  is <comma> it  's  not  about  you <comma> then <comma> when  all  of  a  sudden  it  becomes  the  best-selling  book  in  history <comma> you  got  to  figure <comma> well <comma> i  guess  it  's  not  about  me <period> that  's  kind  of  a  no-brainer <period> so <comma> what  is  it  for <questionmark> and  i  began  to  think  about  what  i  call  the  stewardship  of  affluence  and  the  stewardship  of  influence <period> so  i  believe <comma> essentially <comma> that  leadership  is  stewardship <period> that  if  you  are  a  leader  in  any  area <comma> in  business <comma> in  politics <comma> in  sports <comma> in  art <comma> in  academics <comma> in  any  area <comma> you  do  n't  own  it <period> you  are  a  steward  of  it <period> for  instance <comma> that  's  why  i  believe  in  protecting  the  environment <period> this  is  not  my  planet <period> it  was  n't  mine  before  i  was  born <period> it  's  not  going  to  be  mine  after  i  die <period> i  'm  just  here  for  80  years  and  then  that  's  it <period> i  was  debating  the  other  day  on  a  talk  show <comma> and  the  guy  was  challenging  me  and  go <comma> what  's  a  pastor  doing  on  protecting  the  environment <questionmark> and  i  asked  this  guy <comma> i  said <comma> well <comma> do  you  believe  that  human  beings  are  responsible  to  make  the  world  a  little  bit  better  place  for  the  next  generation <questionmark> do  you  think  we  have  a  stewardship  here <comma> to  take  the  environment  seriously <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> no <period> i  said <comma> oh <comma> you  do  n't  i  said <comma> let  me  make  this  clear  again <period> do  you  believe  that  as  human  beings <comma> i  'm  not  talking  about  religion <comma> do  you  believe  that  as  human  beings <comma> it  is  our  responsibility  to  take  care  of  this  planet  and  make  it  just  a  little  bit  better  for  the  next  generation <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> no <period> not  any  more  than  any  other  species <period> when  he  said  the  word  species <comma> he  was  revealing  his  worldview <period> and  he  was  saying <comma> i  'm  no  more  responsible  to  take  care  of  this  environment  than  a  duck  is <period> well  now <comma> i  know  a  lot  of  times  we  act  like  ducks <comma> but  you  're  not  a  duck <period> you  're  not  a  duck <period> and  you  are  responsible <comma> that  's  my  worldview <period> and  so <comma> you  need  to  understand  what  your  worldview  is <period> the  problem  is  most  people  never  really  think  it  through <period> they  never  really  codify  it  or  qualify  it  or  quantify  it <comma> and  say <comma> this  is  what  i  believe  in <period> this  is  why  i  believe  what  i  believe <period> i  do  n't  personally  have  enough  faith  to  be  an  atheist <period> but  you  may <comma> you  may <period> your  worldview <comma> though <comma> does  determine  everything  else  in  your  life <comma> because  it  determines  your  decisions <period> it  determines  your  relationships <period> it  determines  your  level  of  confidence <period> it  determines <comma> really <comma> everything  in  your  life <period> what  we  believe <comma> obviously <comma> and  you  know  this <comma> determines  our  behavior <comma> and  our  behavior  determines  what  we  become  in  life <period> so  all  of  this  money  started  pouring  in <comma> and  all  of  this  fame  started  pouring  in <comma> and  i  go <comma> what  do  i  do  with  this <questionmark> my  wife  and  i  first  made  five  decisions  on  what  to  do  with  the  money <period> we  said <comma> first <comma> we  're  not  going  to  use  it  on  ourselves <period> i  did  n't  go  out  and  buy  a  bigger  house <period> i  do  n't  own  a  guesthouse <period> i  still  drive  the  same  four-year-old  ford  that  i've  driven <period> we  just  said <comma> we  're  not  going  to  use  it  on  us <period> the  second  thing  was <comma> i  stopped  taking  a  salary  from  the  church  that  i  pastor <period> third  thing  is <comma> i  added  up  all  that  the  church  had  paid  me  over  the  last  25  years <comma> and  i  gave  it  back <period> and  i  gave  it  back  because  i  did  n't  want  anybody  thinking  that  i  do  what  i  do  for  money <comma> i  do  n't <period> in  fact <comma> personally <comma> i've  never  met  a  priest  or  a  pastor  or  a  minister  who  does  it  for  money <period> i  know  that  's  a  stereotype <period> i've  never  met  one  of  them <period> believe  me <comma> there  's  a  whole  lot  easier  ways  to  make  money <period> pastors  are  like  on  24-hours-a-day  call <period> they  're  like  doctors <period> i  left  late  today <period> i'd  hoped  to  be  here  yesterday <comma> because  my  father-in-law  is  in  his  last <comma> probably <comma> 48  hours  before  he  dies  of  cancer <period> and  i  'm  watching  a  guy  who  's  lived  his  life <comma> he  's  now  in  his  mid-80s <comma> and  he  's  dying  with  peace <period> you  know <comma> the  test  of  your  worldview  is  not  how  you  act  in  the  good  times <period> the  test  of  your  worldview  is  how  you  act  at  the  funeral <period> and  having  been  through  literally  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  funerals <comma> it  makes  a  difference <period> it  makes  a  difference  what  you  believe <period> so <comma> we  gave  it  all  back <comma> and  then  we  set  up  three  foundations <comma> working  on  some  of  the  major  problems  of  the  world <comma> illiteracy <comma> poverty <comma> pandemic  diseases <comma> particularly  hiv/aids <comma> and  set  up  these  three  foundations <comma> and  put  the  money  into  that <period> the  last  thing  we  did  is  we  became  what  i  call  reverse  tithers <period> and  that  is <comma> when  my  wife  and  i  got  married  30  years  ago <comma> we  started  tithing <period> now <comma> that  's  a  principle  in  the  bible  that  says  give  10  percent  of  what  you  get  back  to  charity <comma> give  it  away  to  help  other  people <period> so <comma> we  started  doing  that <comma> and  each  year  we  would  raise  our  tithe  1  percent <period> so <comma> our  first  year  of  marriage  we  went  to  11  percent <comma> second  year  we  went  to  12  percent <comma> and  the  third  year  we  went  to  13  percent <comma> and  on  and  on  and  on <period> why  did  i  do  that <questionmark> because  every  time  i  give <comma> it  breaks  the  grip  of  materialism  in  my  life <period> materialism  is  all  about  getting <comma> get <comma> get <comma> get <comma> get  all  you  can <comma> can  all  you  get <comma> sit  on  the  can  and  spoil  the  rest <period> it  's  all  about  more <comma> having  more <period> and  we  think  that  the  good  life  is  actually  looking  good  -- <period> that  's  most  important  of  all <comma> looking  good <comma> feeling  good  and  having  the  goods <period> but  that  's  not  the  good  life <period> i  meet  people  all  the  time  who  have  those <comma> and  they  're  not  necessarily  happy <period> if  money  actually  made  you  happy <comma> then  the  wealthiest  people  in  the  world  would  be  the  happiest <period> and  that  i  know <comma> personally <comma> i  know <comma> is  not  true <period> it  's  just  not  true <period> so <comma> the  good  life  is  not  about  looking  good <comma> feeling  good  or  having  the  goods <period> it  's  about  being  good  and  doing  good <period> giving  your  life  away <period> significance  in  life  does  n't  come  from  status <comma> because  you  can  always  find  somebody  who  's  got  more  than  you <period> it  does  n't  come  from  sex <period> it  does  n't  come  from  salary <period> it  comes  from  serving <period> it  is  in  giving  our  lives  away  that  we  find  meaning <comma> we  find  significance <period> that  's  the  way  we  were  wired <comma> i  believe <comma> by  god <period> and  so  we  began  to  give  away <comma> and  now  after  30  years <comma> my  wife  and  i  are  reverse  tithers <comma> we  give  away  90  percent  and  live  on  10 <period> that <comma> actually <comma> was  the  easy  part <period> the  hard  part  is <comma> what  do  i  do  with  all  this  attention <questionmark> because  i  start  getting  all  kinds  of  invitations <period> i  just  came  off  a  nearly  month-long  speaking  tour  on  three  different  continents <comma> and  i  wo  n't  go  into  that <comma> but  it  was  an  amazing  thing <period> and  i  'm  going <comma> what  do  i  do  with  this  notoriety  that  the  book  has  brought <questionmark> and  being  a  pastor <comma> i  started  reading  the  bible <period> there  's  a  chapter  in  the  bible  called  psalm  72 <comma> and  it  's  solomon  's  prayer  for  more  influence <period> when  you  read  this  prayer <comma> it  sounds  incredibly  selfish <comma> self-centered <period> it  sounds  like <comma> he  says <comma> god <comma> i  want  you  to  make  me  famous <period> that  's  what  he  prays <period> he  says <comma> i  want  you  to  make  me  famous <period> i  want  you  to  spread  the  fame  of  my  name  through  every  land <period> i  want  you  to  give  me  power <period> i  want  you  to  make  me  famous <period> i  want  you  to  give  me  influence <period> and  it  just  sounds  like  the  most  egotistical  request  you  could  make  if  you  were  going  to  pray <period> until  you  read  the  whole  psalm <comma> the  whole  chapter <period> and  then  he  says <comma> so  that  the  king <comma> he  was  the  king  of  israel  at  that  time  at  its  apex  in  power <comma> so  that  the  king  may  care  for  the  widow  and  orphan <comma> support  depressed <comma> defend  the  defenseless <comma> care  for  the  sick <comma> assist  the  poor <comma> speak  up  for  the  foreigner <comma> those  in  prison <period> basically <comma> he  's  talking  about  all  the  marginalized  in  society <period> and  as  i  read  that <comma> i  looked  at  it <comma> and  i  thought <comma> you  know <comma> what  this  is  saying  is  that  the  purpose  of  influence  is  to  speak  up  for  those  who  have  no  influence <period> the  purpose  of  influence  is  not  to  build  your  ego <comma> or  your  net  worth <period> and <comma> by  the  way <comma> your  net  worth  is  not  the  same  thing  as  your  self-worth <period> your  value  is  not  based  on  your  valuables <period> it  's  based  on  a  whole  different  set  of  things <period> and  so  the  purpose  of  influence  is  to  speak  up  for  those  who  have  no  influence <period> and  i  had  to  admit <comma> i  cannot  think  of  the  last  time  i  thought  of  widows  and  orphans <period> they  're  not  on  my  radar <period> i  pastor  a  church  in  one  of  the  most  affluent  areas  of  america <comma> a  bunch  of  gated  communities <period> i  have  a  church  full  of  ceos  and  scientists <period> and  i  could  go  five  years  and  never <comma> ever  see  a  homeless  person <period> they  're  just  not  in  my  pathway <period> now <comma> they  're  13  miles  up  the  road  in  santa  ana <period> so <comma> i  had  to  say <comma> ok <comma> i  would  use  whatever  affluence  and  whatever  influence  i've  got  to  help  those  who  do  n't  have  either  of  those <period> you  know <comma> there  's  a  story  in  the  bible  about  moses <period> whether  you  believe  it  's  true  or  not <comma> it  really  did  n't  matter  to  me <period> but  moses <comma> if  you  saw  the  movie <comma> the  ten  commandments <comma> moses  goes  out <comma> and  there  's  this  burning  bush <comma> and  god  talks  to  him <period> and  god  says <comma> moses <comma> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> i  think  that  's  one  of  the  most  important  questions  you  'll  ever  be  asked <period> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> moses  says <comma> it  's  a  staff <period> it  's  a  shepherd  's  staff <period> and  god  says <comma> throw  it  down <period> and  if  you  saw  the  movie <comma> you  know <comma> he  throws  it  down  and  it  becomes  a  snake <period> and  then  god  says <comma> pick  it  up <period> and  he  picks  it  back  up  again <comma> and  it  becomes  a  staff  again <period> now <comma> i  'm  reading  this  thing <comma> and  i  'm  going <comma> what  is  that  all  about <questionmark> ok <period> what  's  that  all  about <questionmark> well <comma> i  do  know  a  couple  of  things <period> number  one <comma> god  never  does  a  miracle  to  show  off <period> it  's  not  just <comma> wow <comma> is  n't  that  cool <questionmark> and <comma> by  the  way <comma> my  god  does  n't  have  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread <period> you  know <comma> if  god  's  going  to  show  up <comma> he  's  not  going  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread <period> ok <questionmark> i  just <comma> this  is  why  i  love  what  michael  does <comma> because  it  's  like <comma> ok <comma> if  he  's  debunking  it <comma> then  i  do  n't  have  to <period> but  god <comma> my  god <comma> does  n't  show  up  on  sprinkler  images <period> he  got  a  few  more  powerful  ways  than  that  to  do  whatever  he  wants  to  do <period> but  he  does  n't  do  miracles  just  to  show  off <period> second  thing  is <comma> if  god  ever  asks  you  a  question <comma> he  already  knows  the  answer <period> obviously <comma> if  he  's  god <comma> then  that  would  mean  that  when  he  asks  the  question <comma> it  's  for  your  benefit <comma> not  his <period> so <comma> he  's  going <comma> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> now <comma> what  was  in  moses  hand <questionmark> well <comma> it  was  a  shepherd  's  staff <period> now <comma> follow  me  on  this <period> this  staff  represented  three  things  about  moses  life <period> first <comma> it  represented  his  identity <period> he  was  a  shepherd <period> it  's  the  symbol  of  his  own  occupation <period> i  am  a  shepherd <period> it  's  a  symbol  of  his  identity <comma> his  career <comma> his  job <period> second <comma> it  's  a  symbol  of  not  only  his  identity <period> it  's  a  symbol  of  his  income <comma> because  all  of  his  assets  are  tied  up  in  sheep <period> in  those  days  nobody  had  bank  accounts <comma> or  american  express  cards <comma> or  hedge  funds <period> your  assets  are  tied  up  in  your  flocks <period> so  it  's  a  symbol  of  his  identity <comma> and  it  's  a  symbol  of  his  income <period> and  the  third  thing <comma> it  's  a  symbol  of  his  influence <period> what  do  you  do  with  a  shepherd  's  staff <questionmark> well <comma> you  know <comma> you  move  sheep  from  point  a  to  point  b  with  it <comma> by  hook  or  by  crook <period> you  pull  them  or  you  poke  them <comma> one  or  the  other <period> so <comma> he  's  saying <comma> you  're  going  to  lay  down  your  identity <period> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> you've  got  identity <period> you've  got  income <period> you've  got  influence <period> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> and  he  's  saying <comma> if  you  lay  it  down <comma> i  'll  make  it  come  alive <period> i  'll  do  some  things  you  could  never  imagine  possible <period> and  if  you've  watched  that  movie <comma> ten  commandments <comma> all  of  those  big  miracles  that  happen  in  egypt  are  done  through  this  staff <period> last  year <comma> i  was  invited  to  speak  at  nba  all-stars  game <period> and  so <comma> i  'm  talking  to  the  players <comma> because  most  of  the  nba  teams <comma> nfl  teams  and  all  the  other  teams  have  done  this  40  days  of  purpose <comma> based  on  the  book <period> and  i  asked  them <comma> i  said <comma> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> so <comma> what  's  in  your  hand  i  said <comma> it  's  a  basketball <comma> and  that  basketball  represents  your  identity <comma> who  you  are <period> you  're  an  nba  player <period> it  represents  your  income <period> you  're  making  a  lot  of  money  off  that  little  ball <period> and  it  represents  your  influence <period> and  even  though  you  're  only  going  to  be  in  the  nba  for  a  few  years <comma> you  're  going  to  be  an  nba  player  for  the  rest  of  your  life <period> and  that  gives  with  you  enormous  influence <period> so <comma> what  are  you  going  to  do  with  what  you've  been  given <questionmark> and  i  guess  that  's  the  main  reason  i  came  up  here  today <comma> to  all  of  you  very  bright  people  at  ted <comma> is  to  say <comma> what  's  in  your  hand <questionmark> what  do  you  have  that  you've  been  given <questionmark> talent <comma> background <comma> education <comma> freedom <comma> networks <comma> opportunities <comma> wealth <comma> ideas <comma> creativity <period> what  are  you  doing  with  what  you've  been  given <questionmark> that <comma> to  me <comma> is  the  primary  question  about  life <period> that <comma> to  me <comma> is  what  being  purpose-driven  is  all  about <period> in  the  book  i  talk  about  how  you  're  wired  to  do  certain  things <comma> you  're  shaped <period> this  little  cross  takes  spiritual  gifts <comma> heart <comma> ability <comma> personality  and  experiences <period> these  things  shape  you <period> and  if  you  want  to  know  what  you  ought  to  be  doing  with  your  life <comma> you  need  to  look  at  your  shape <period> what  am  i  wired  to  do <questionmark> why  would  god  wire  you  to  do  something  and  then  not  have  you  do  it <questionmark> if  you  're  wired  to  be  an  anthropologist <comma> you  'll  be  an  anthropologist <period> if  you  're  wired  to  be  an  undersea  explorer <comma> you  'll  be  an  undersea  explorer <period> if  you  're  wired  to  make  deals <comma> you  make  deals <period> if  you  're  wired  to  paint <comma> you  paint <period> did  you  know  that  god  smiles  when  you  be  you <questionmark> when  my  little  kids  were  little <comma> they  're  all  grown <comma> now  i  have  grandkids <comma> i  used  to  go  in  and  sit  on  the  side  of  their  bed <comma> and  i  used  to  watch  my  kids  sleep <period> and  i  just  watched  their  little  bodies  rise  and  lower <comma> rise  and  lower <period> and  i  would  look  at  them <comma> this  is  not  an  accident <period> rise  and  lower  -- <period> and  i  got  joy  out  of  just  watching  them  sleep <period> some  people  have  the  misguided  idea  that  god  only  gets  excited  when  you  're  doing <comma> quote <comma> spiritual  things <comma> like  going  to  church  or  helping  the  poor <comma> or <comma> you  know <comma> confessing  or  doing  something  like  that <period> the  bottom  line  is <comma> god  gets  pleasure  watching  you  be  you <period> why <questionmark> he  made  you <period> and  when  you  do  what  you  were  made  to  do <comma> he  goes <comma> that  's  my  boy <period> that  's  my  girl <period> you  're  using  the  talent  and  ability  that  i  gave  you <period> so  my  advice  to  you  is <comma> look  at  what  's  in  your  hand <comma> your  identity <comma> your  influence <comma> your  income <comma> and  say <comma> it  's  not  about  me <period> it  's  about  making  the  world  a  better  place <period> thank  you <period> so  i  'm  here  to  explain  why  i  'm  wearing  these  ninja  pajamas <period> and  to  do  that <comma> i'd  like  to  talk  first  about  environmental  toxins  in  our  bodies <period> so  some  of  you  may  know  about  the  chemical  bisphenol  a <comma> bpa <period> it  's  a  material  hardener  and  synthetic  estrogen  that  's  found  in  the  lining  of  canned  foods  and  some  plastics <period> so  bpa  mimics  the  body  's  own  hormones  and  causes  neurological  and  reproductive  problems <period> and  it  's  everywhere <period> a  recent  study  found  bpa  in  93  percent  of  people  six  and  older <period> but  it  's  just  one  chemical <period> the  center  for  disease  control  in  the  us <period> says  we  have  219  toxic  pollutants  in  our  bodies <comma> and  this  includes  preservatives <comma> pesticides  and  heavy  metals  like  lead  and  mercury <period> to  me <comma> this  says  three  things <period> first <comma> do  n't  become  a  cannibal <period> second <comma> we  are  both  responsible  for  and  the  victims  of  our  own  pollution <period> and  third <comma> our  bodies  are  filters  and  storehouses  for  environmental  toxins <period> so  what  happens  to  all  these  toxins  when  we  die <questionmark> the  short  answer  is <comma> they  return  to  the  environment  in  one  way  or  another <comma> continuing  the  cycle  of  toxicity <period> but  our  current  funeral  practices  make  the  situation  much  worse <period> if  you  're  cremated <comma> all  those  toxins  i  mentioned  are  released  into  the  atmosphere <period> and  this  includes  5,000  pounds  of  mercury  from  our  dental  fillings  alone  every  year <period> and  in  a  traditional  american  funeral <comma> a  dead  body  is  covered  with  fillers  and  cosmetics  to  make  it  look  alive <period> it  's  then  pumped  with  toxic  formaldehyde  to  slow  decomposition <comma> a  practice  which  causes  respiratory  problems  and  cancer  in  funeral  personnel <period> so  by  trying  to  preserve  our  dead  bodies <comma> we  deny  death <comma> poison  the  living  and  further  harm  the  environment <period> green  or  natural  burials <comma> which  do  n't  use  embalming <comma> are  a  step  in  the  right  direction <comma> but  they  do  n't  address  the  existing  toxins  in  our  bodies <period> i  think  there  's  a  better  solution <period> i  'm  an  artist <comma> so  i'd  like  to  offer  a  modest  proposal  at  the  intersection  of  art <comma> science  and  culture <period> the  infinity  burial  project <comma> an  alternative  burial  system  that  uses  mushrooms  to  decompose  and  clean  toxins  in  bodies <period> the  infinity  burial  project  began  a  few  years  ago  with  a  fantasy  to  create  the  infinity  mushroom <comma> a  new  hybrid  mushroom  that  would  decompose  bodies <comma> clean  the  toxins  and  deliver  nutrients  to  plant  roots <comma> leaving  clean  compost <period> but  i  learned  it  's  nearly  impossible  to  create  a  new  hybrid  mushroom <period> i  also  learned  that  some  of  our  tastiest  mushrooms  can  clean  environmental  toxins  in  soil <period> so  i  thought  maybe  i  could  train  an  army  of  toxin-cleaning  edible  mushrooms  to  eat  my  body <period> so  today <comma> i  'm  collecting  what  i  shed  or  slough  off <comma> my  hair <comma> skin  and  nails <comma> and  i  'm  feeding  these  to  edible  mushrooms <period> as  the  mushrooms  grow <comma> i  pick  the  best  feeders  to  become  infinity  mushrooms <period> it  's  a  kind  of  imprinting  and  selective  breeding  process  for  the  afterlife <period> so  when  i  die <comma> the  infinity  mushrooms  will  recognize  my  body  and  be  able  to  eat  it <period> all  right <comma> so  for  some  of  you <comma> this  may  be  really <comma> really  out  there <period> just  a  little <period> i  realize  this  is  not  the  kind  of  relationship  that  we  usually  aspire  to  have  with  our  food <period> we  want  to  eat <comma> not  be  eaten  by <comma> our  food <period> but  as  i  watch  the  mushrooms  grow  and  digest  my  body <comma> i  imagine  the  infinity  mushroom  as  a  symbol  of  a  new  way  of  thinking  about  death  and  the  relationship  between  my  body  and  the  environment <period> see  for  me <comma> cultivating  the  infinity  mushroom  is  more  than  just  scientific  experimentation  or  gardening  or  raising  a  pet <comma> it  's  a  step  towards  accepting  the  fact  that  someday  i  will  die  and  decay <period> it  's  also  a  step  towards  taking  responsibility  for  my  own  burden  on  the  planet <period> growing  a  mushroom  is  also  part  of  a  larger  practice  of  cultivating  decomposing  organisms  called  decompiculture <comma> a  concept  that  was  developed  by  an  entomologist <comma> timothy  myles <period> the  infinity  mushroom  is  a  subset  of  decompiculture  i  'm  calling  body  decompiculture  and  toxin  remediation <comma> the  cultivation  of  organisms  that  decompose  and  clean  toxins  in  bodies <period> and  now  about  these  ninja  pajamas <period> once  it  's  completed <comma> i  plan  to  integrate  the  infinity  mushrooms  into  a  number  of  objects <period> first <comma> a  burial  suit  infused  with  mushroom  spores <comma> the  mushroom  death  suit <period> i  'm  wearing  the  second  prototype  of  this  burial  suit <period> it  's  covered  with  a  crocheted  netting  that  is  embedded  with  mushroom  spores <period> the  dendritic  pattern  you  see  mimics  the  growth  of  mushroom  mycelia <comma> which  are  the  equivalent  of  plant  roots <period> i  'm  also  making  a  decompiculture  kit <comma> a  cocktail  of  capsules  that  contain  infinity  mushroom  spores  and  other  elements  that  speed  decomposition  and  toxin  remediation <period> these  capsules  are  embedded  in  a  nutrient-rich  jelly <comma> a  kind  of  second  skin <comma> which  dissolves  quickly  and  becomes  baby  food  for  the  growing  mushrooms <period> so  i  plan  to  finish  the  mushroom  and  decompiculture  kit  in  the  next  year  or  two <comma> and  then  i'd  like  to  begin  testing  them <comma> first  with  expired  meat  from  the  market  and  then  with  human  subjects <period> and  believe  it  or  not <comma> a  few  people  have  offered  to  donate  their  bodies  to  the  project  to  be  eaten  by  mushrooms <period> what  i've  learned  from  talking  to  these  folks  is  that  we  share  a  common  desire  to  understand  and  accept  death  and  to  minimize  the  impact  of  our  death  on  the  environment <period> i  wanted  to  cultivate  this  perspective  just  like  the  mushrooms <comma> so  i  formed  the  decompiculture  society <comma> a  group  of  people  called  decompinauts  who  actively  explore  their  postmortem  options <comma> seek  death  acceptance  and  cultivate  decomposing  organisms  like  the  infinity  mushroom <period> the  decompiculture  society  shares  a  vision  of  a  cultural  shift <comma> from  our  current  culture  of  death  denial  and  body  preservation  to  one  of  decompiculture <comma> a  radical  acceptance  of  death  and  decomposition <period> accepting  death  means  accepting  that  we  are  physical  beings  who  are  intimately  connected  to  the  environment <comma> as  the  research  on  environmental  toxins  confirms <period> and  the  saying  goes <comma> we  came  from  dust  and  will  return  to  dust <period> and  once  we  understand  that  we  're  connected  to  the  environment <comma> we  see  that  the  survival  of  our  species  depends  on  the  survival  of  the  planet <period> i  believe  this  is  the  beginning  of  true  environmental  responsibility <period> thank  you <period> let  's  talk  about  billions <period> let  's  talk  about  past  and  future  billions <period> we  know  that  about  106  billion  people  have  ever  lived <period> and  we  know  that  most  of  them  are  dead <period> and  we  also  know  that  most  of  them  live  or  lived  in  asia <period> and  we  also  know  that  most  of  them  were  or  are  very  poor <comma> did  not  live  for  very  long <period> let  's  talk  about  billions <period> the  195,000  billion  dollars  of  wealth  in  the  world  today <period> we  know  that  most  of  that  wealth  was  made  after  the  year  1800 <period> and  we  know  that  most  of  it  is  currently  owned  by  people  we  might  call  westerners <comma> europeans <comma> north  americans <comma> australasians <period> 19  percent  of  the  world  's  population  today <comma> westerners  own  two-thirds  of  its  wealth <period> economic  historians  call  this  the  great  divergence <period> and  this  slide  here  is  the  best  simplification  of  the  great  divergence  story  i  can  offer  you <period> it  's  basically  two  ratios  of  per  capita  gdp <comma> per  capita  gross  domestic  product <comma> so  average  income <period> one <comma> the  red  line <comma> is  the  ratio  of  british  to  indian  per  capita  income <period> and  the  blue  line  is  the  ratio  of  american  to  chinese <period> and  this  chart  goes  back  to  1500 <period> and  you  can  see  here  that  there  's  an  exponential  great  divergence <period> they  start  off  pretty  close  together <period> in  fact <comma> in  1500 <comma> the  average  chinese  was  richer  than  the  average  north  american <period> when  you  get  to  the  1970s <comma> which  is  where  this  chart  ends <comma> the  average  briton  is  more  than  10  times  richer  than  the  average  indian <period> and  that  's  allowing  for  differences  in  the  cost  of  living <period> it  's  based  on  purchasing  power  parity <period> the  average  american  is  nearly  20  times  richer  than  the  average  chinese  by  the  1970s <period> so  why <questionmark> this  was  n't  just  an  economic  story <period> if  you  take  the  10  countries  that  went  on  to  become  the  western  empires <comma> in  1500  they  were  really  quite  tiny <comma> five  percent  of  the  world  's  land  surface <comma> 16  percent  of  its  population <comma> maybe  20  percent  of  its  income <period> by  1913 <comma> these  10  countries <comma> plus  the  united  states <comma> controlled  vast  global  empires <comma> 58  percent  of  the  world  's  territory <period> about  the  same  percentage  of  its  population <comma> and  a  really  huge <comma> nearly  three-quarters  share  of  global  economic  output <period> and  notice <comma> most  of  that  went  to  the  motherland <comma> to  the  imperial  metropoles <comma> not  to  their  colonial  possessions <period> now  you  cannot  just  blame  this  on  imperialism <comma> though  many  people  have  tried  to  do  so <comma> for  two  reasons <period> one <comma> empire  was  the  least  original  thing  that  the  west  did  after  1500 <period> everybody  did  empire <period> they  beat  preexisting  oriental  empires  like  the  mughals  and  the  ottomans <period> so  it  really  does  n't  look  like  empire  is  a  great  explanation  for  the  great  divergence <period> in  any  case <comma> as  you  may  remember <comma> the  great  divergence  reaches  its  zenith  in  the  1970s <comma> some  considerable  time  after  decolonization <period> this  is  not  a  new  question <period> samuel  johnson <comma> the  great  lexicographer <comma> posed  it  through  his  character  rasselas  in  his  novel  rasselas <comma> prince  of  abissinia <comma> published  in  1759 <period> by  what  means  are  the  europeans  thus  powerful <period> or  why <comma> since  they  can  so  easily  visit  asia  and  africa  for  trade  or  conquest <comma> cannot  the  asiaticks  and  africans  invade  their  coasts <comma> plant  colonies  in  their  ports <comma> and  give  laws  to  their  natural  princes <questionmark> the  same  wind  that  carries  them  back  would  bring  us  thither <questionmark> that  's  a  great  question <period> and  you  know  what <comma> it  was  also  being  asked  at  roughly  the  same  time  by  the  resterners <comma> by  the  people  in  the  rest  of  the  world <comma> like  ibrahim  muteferrika <comma> an  ottoman  official <comma> the  man  who  introduced  printing <comma> very  belatedly <comma> to  the  ottoman  empire <comma> who  said  in  a  book  published  in  1731 <comma> why  do  christian  nations  which  were  so  weak  in  the  past  compared  with  muslim  nations  begin  to  dominate  so  many  lands  in  modern  times  and  even  defeat  the  once  victorious  ottoman  armies <questionmark> unlike  rasselas <comma> muteferrika  had  an  answer  to  that  question <comma> which  was  correct <period> he  said  it  was  because  they  have  laws  and  rules  invented  by  reason <period> it  's  not  geography <period> you  may  think  we  can  explain  the  great  divergence  in  terms  of  geography <period> we  know  that  's  wrong <comma> because  we  conducted  two  great  natural  experiments  in  the  20th  century  to  see  if  geography  mattered  more  than  institutions <period> we  took  all  the  germans <comma> we  divided  them  roughly  in  two <comma> and  we  gave  the  ones  in  the  east  communism <comma> and  you  see  the  result <period> within  an  incredibly  short  period  of  time <comma> people  living  in  the  german  democratic  republic <period> produced  trabants <comma> the  trabbi <comma> one  of  the  world  's  worst  ever  cars <comma> while  people  in  the  west  produced  the  mercedes  benz <period> if  you  still  do  n't  believe  me <comma> we  conducted  the  experiment  also  in  the  korean  peninsula <period> and  we  decided  we'd  take  koreans  in  roughly  the  same  geographical  place  with <comma> notice <comma> the  same  basic  traditional  culture <comma> and  we  divided  them  in  two <comma> and  we  gave  the  northerners  communism <period> and  the  result  is  an  even  bigger  divergence  in  a  very  short  space  of  time  than  happened  in  germany <period> not  a  big  divergence  in  terms  of  uniform  design  for  border  guards  admittedly <comma> but  in  almost  every  other  respect <comma> it  's  a  huge  divergence <period> which  leads  me  to  think  that  neither  geography  nor  national  character <comma> popular  explanations  for  this  kind  of  thing <comma> are  really  significant <period> it  's  the  ideas <period> it  's  the  institutions <period> this  must  be  true  because  a  scotsman  said  it <period> and  i  think  i  'm  the  only  scotsman  here  at  the  edinburgh  ted <period> so  let  me  just  explain  to  you  that  the  smartest  man  ever  was  a  scotsman <period> he  was  adam  smith <comma> not  billy  connolly <comma> not  sean  connery <comma> though  he  is  very  smart  indeed <period> smith <comma> and  i  want  you  to  go  and  bow  down  before  his  statue  in  the  royal  mile <period> it  's  a  wonderful  statue <comma> smith <comma> in  the  wealth  of  nations  published  in  1776 <comma> that  's  the  most  important  thing  that  happened  that  year <period> you  bet <period> there  was  a  little  local  difficulty  in  some  of  our  minor  colonies <comma> but <period> china  seems  to  have  been  long  stationary <comma> and  probably  long  ago  acquired  that  full  complement  of  riches  which  is  consistent  with  the  nature  of  its  laws  and  institutions <period> but  this  complement  may  be  much  inferior  to  what <comma> with  other  laws  and  institutions <comma> the  nature  of  its  soil <comma> climate <comma> and  situation  might  admit  of <period> that  is  so  right  and  so  cool <period> and  he  said  it  such  a  long  time  ago <period> but  you  know <comma> this  is  a  ted  audience <comma> and  if  i  keep  talking  about  institutions <comma> you  're  going  to  turn  off <period> so  i  'm  going  to  translate  this  into  language  that  you  can  understand <period> let  's  call  them  the  killer  apps <period> i  want  to  explain  to  you  that  there  were  six  killer  apps  that  set  the  west  apart  from  the  rest <period> and  they  're  kind  of  like  the  apps  on  your  phone <comma> in  the  sense  that  they  look  quite  simple <period> they  're  just  icons <period> you  click  on  them <period> but  behind  the  icon <comma> there  's  complex  code <period> it  's  the  same  with  institutions <period> there  are  six  which  i  think  explain  the  great  divergence <period> one <comma> competition <period> two <comma> the  scientific  revolution <period> three <comma> property  rights <period> four <comma> modern  medicine <period> five <comma> the  consumer  society <period> and  six <comma> the  work  ethic <period> you  can  play  a  game  and  try  and  think  of  one  i've  missed  at <comma> or  try  and  boil  it  down  to  just  four <comma> but  you  'll  lose <period> let  me  very  briefly  tell  you  what  i  mean  by  this <comma> synthesizing  the  work  of  many  economic  historians  in  the  process <period> competition  means <comma> not  only  were  there  a  hundred  different  political  units  in  europe  in  1500 <comma> but  within  each  of  these  units <comma> there  was  competition  between  corporations  as  well  as  sovereigns <period> the  ancestor  of  the  modern  corporation <comma> the  city  of  london  corporation <comma> existed  in  the  12th  century <period> nothing  like  this  existed  in  china <comma> where  there  was  one  monolithic  state  covering  a  fifth  of  humanity <comma> and  anyone  with  any  ambition  had  to  pass  one  standardized  examination <comma> which  took  three  days  and  was  very  difficult  and  involved  memorizing  vast  numbers  of  characters  and  very  complex  confucian  essay  writing <period> the  scientific  revolution  was  different  from  the  science  that  had  been  achieved  in  the  oriental  world  in  a  number  of  crucial  ways <comma> the  most  important  being  that <comma> through  the  experimental  method <comma> it  gave  men  control  over  nature  in  a  way  that  had  not  been  possible  before <period> example <comma> benjamin  robins  's  extraordinary  application  of  newtonian  physics  to  ballistics <period> once  you  do  that <comma> your  artillery  becomes  accurate <period> think  of  what  that  means <period> that  really  was  a  killer  application <period> meanwhile <comma> there  's  no  scientific  revolution  anywhere  else <period> the  ottoman  empire  's  not  that  far  from  europe <comma> but  there  's  no  scientific  revolution  there <period> in  fact <comma> they  demolish  taqi  al-din  's  observatory <comma> because  it  's  considered  blasphemous  to  inquire  into  the  mind  of  god <period> property  rights <comma> it  's  not  the  democracy <comma> folks <period> it  's  having  the  rule  of  law  based  on  private  property  rights <period> that  's  what  makes  the  difference  between  north  america  and  south  america <period> you  could  turn  up  in  north  america  having  signed  a  deed  of  indenture  saying <comma> i  'll  work  for  nothing  for  five  years <period> you  just  have  to  feed  me <period> but  at  the  end  of  it <comma> you've  got  a  hundred  acres  of  land <period> that  's  the  land  grant  on  the  bottom  half  of  the  slide <period> that  's  not  possible  in  latin  america  where  land  is  held  onto  by  a  tiny  elite  descended  from  the  conquistadors <period> and  you  can  see  here  the  huge  divergence  that  happens  in  property  ownership  between  north  and  south <period> most  people  in  rural  north  america  owned  some  land  by  1900 <period> hardly  anyone  in  south  america  did <period> that  's  another  killer  app <period> modern  medicine  in  the  late  19th  century  began  to  make  major  breakthroughs  against  the  infectious  diseases  that  killed  a  lot  of  people <period> and  this  was  another  killer  app <comma> the  very  opposite  of  a  killer <comma> because  it  doubled <comma> and  then  more  than  doubled <comma> human  life  expectancy <period> it  even  did  that  in  the  european  empires <period> even  in  places  like  senegal <comma> beginning  in  the  early  20th  century <comma> there  were  major  breakthroughs  in  public  health <comma> and  life  expectancy  began  to  rise <period> it  does  n't  rise  any  faster  after  these  countries  become  independent <period> the  empires  were  n't  all  bad <period> the  consumer  society  is  what  you  need  for  the  industrial  revolution  to  have  a  point <period> you  need  people  to  want  to  wear  tons  of  clothes <period> you've  all  bought  an  article  of  clothing  in  the  last  month <period> i  guarantee  it <period> that  's  the  consumer  society <period> and  it  propels  economic  growth  more  than  even  technological  change  itself <period> japan  was  the  first  non-western  society  to  embrace  it <period> the  alternative <comma> which  was  proposed  by  mahatma  gandhi <comma> was  to  institutionalize  and  make  poverty  permanent <period> very  few  indians  today  wish  that  india  had  gone  down  mahatma  gandhi  's  road <period> finally <comma> the  work  ethic <period> max  weber  thought  that  was  peculiarly  protestant <period> he  was  wrong <period> any  culture  can  get  the  work  ethic  if  the  institutions  are  there  to  create  the  incentive  to  work <period> we  know  this  because  today  the  work  ethic  is  no  longer  a  protestant <comma> western  phenomenon <period> in  fact <comma> the  west  has  lost  its  work  ethic <period> today <comma> the  average  korean  works  a  thousand  hours  more  a  year  than  the  average  german <comma> a  thousand <period> and  this  is  part  of  a  really  extraordinary  phenomenon <comma> and  that  is  the  end  of  the  great  divergence <period> who  's  got  the  work  ethic  now <questionmark> take  a  look  at  mathematical  attainment  by  15  year-olds <period> at  the  top  of  the  international  league  table  according  to  the  latest  pisa  study <comma> is  the  shanghai  district  of  china <period> the  gap  between  shanghai  and  the  united  kingdom  and  the  united  states  is  as  big  as  the  gap  between  the  uk <period> and  the  us <period> and  albania  and  tunisia <period> you  probably  assume  that  because  the  iphone  was  designed  in  california  but  assembled  in  china  that  the  west  still  leads  in  terms  of  technological  innovation <period> you  're  wrong <period> in  terms  of  patents <comma> there  's  no  question  that  the  east  is  ahead <period> not  only  has  japan  been  ahead  for  some  time <comma> south  korea  has  gone  into  third  place <comma> and  china  is  just  about  to  overtake  germany <period> why <questionmark> because  the  killer  apps  can  be  downloaded <period> it  's  open  source <period> any  society  can  adopt  these  institutions <comma> and  when  they  do <comma> they  achieve  what  the  west  achieved  after  1500 <comma> only  faster <period> this  is  the  great  reconvergence <comma> and  it  's  the  biggest  story  of  your  lifetime <period> because  it  's  on  your  watch  that  this  is  happening <period> it  's  our  generation  that  is  witnessing  the  end  of  western  predominance <period> the  average  american  used  to  be  more  than  20  times  richer  than  the  average  chinese <period> now  it  's  just  five  times <comma> and  soon  it  will  be  25  times <period> so  i  want  to  end  with  three  questions  for  the  future  billions <comma> just  ahead  of  2016 <comma> when  the  united  states  will  lose  its  place  as  number  one  economy  to  china <period> the  first  is <comma> can  you  delete  these  apps <comma> and  are  we  in  the  process  of  doing  so  in  the  western  world <questionmark> the  second  question  is <comma> does  the  sequencing  of  the  download  matter <questionmark> and  could  africa  get  that  sequencing  wrong <questionmark> one  obvious  implication  of  modern  economic  history  is  that  it  's  quite  hard  to  transition  to  democracy  before  you've  established  secure  private  property  rights <period> warning <comma> that  may  not  work <period> and  third <comma> can  china  do  without  killer  app  number  three <questionmark> that  's  the  one  that  john  locke  systematized  when  he  said  that  freedom  was  rooted  in  private  property  rights  and  the  protection  of  law <period> that  's  the  basis  for  the  western  model  of  representative  government <period> now  this  picture  shows  the  demolition  of  the  chinese  artist  ai  weiwei  's  studio  in  shanghai  earlier  this  year <period> he  's  now  free  again <comma> having  been  detained <comma> as  you  know <comma> for  some  time <period> but  i  do  n't  think  his  studio  has  been  rebuilt <period> winston  churchill  once  defined  civilization  in  a  lecture  he  gave  in  the  fateful  year  of  1938 <period> and  i  think  these  words  really  nail  it <comma> it  means  a  society  based  upon  the  opinion  of  civilians <period> it  means  that  violence <comma> the  rule  of  warriors  and  despotic  chiefs <comma> the  conditions  of  camps  and  warfare <comma> of  riot  and  tyranny <comma> give  place  to  parliaments  where  laws  are  made <comma> and  independent  courts  of  justice  in  which  over  long  periods  those  laws  are  maintained <period> that  is  civilization <comma> and  in  its  soil  grow  continually  freedom <comma> comfort  and  culture <comma> what  all  tedsters  care  about  most <period> when  civilization  reigns  in  any  country <comma> a  wider  and  less  harassed  life  is  afforded  to  the  masses  of  the  people <period> that  's  so  true <period> i  do  n't  think  the  decline  of  western  civilization  is  inevitable <comma> because  i  do  n't  think  history  operates  in  this  kind  of  life-cycle  model <comma> beautifully  illustrated  by  thomas  cole  's  course  of  empire  paintings <period> that  's  not  the  way  history  works <period> that  's  not  the  way  the  west  rose <comma> and  i  do  n't  think  it  's  the  way  the  west  will  fall <period> the  west  may  collapse  very  suddenly <period> complex  civilizations  do  that <comma> because  they  operate <comma> most  of  the  time <comma> on  the  edge  of  chaos <period> that  's  one  of  the  most  profound  insights  to  come  out  of  the  historical  study  of  complex  institutions  like  civilizations <period> no <comma> we  may  hang  on <comma> despite  the  huge  burdens  of  debt  that  we've  accumulated <comma> despite  the  evidence  that  we've  lost  our  work  ethic  and  other  parts  of  our  historical  mojo <period> but  one  thing  is  for  sure <comma> the  great  divergence  is  over <comma> folks <period> thanks  very  much <period> bruno  giussani <comma> niall <comma> i  am  just  curious  about  your  take  on  the  other  region  of  the  world  that  's  booming <comma> which  is  latin  america <period> what  's  your  view  on  that <questionmark> niall  ferguson <comma> well  i  really  am  not  just  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  east <period> i  'm  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  rest <comma> and  that  includes  south  america <period> i  once  asked  one  of  my  colleagues  at  harvard <comma> hey <comma> is  south  america  part  of  the  west <questionmark> he  was  an  expert  in  latin  american  history <period> he  said <comma> i  do  n't  know <period> i  'll  have  to  think  about  that <period> that  tells  you  something  really  important <period> i  think  if  you  look  at  what  is  happening  in  brazil  in  particular <comma> but  also  chile <comma> which  was  in  many  ways  the  one  that  led  the  way  in  transforming  the  institutions  of  economic  life <comma> there  's  a  very  bright  future  indeed <period> so  my  story  really  is  as  much  about  that  convergence  in  the  americas  as  it  's  a  convergence  story  in  eurasia <period> bg <comma> and  there  is  this  impression  that  north  america  and  europe  are  not  really  paying  attention  to  these  trends <period> mostly  they  're  worried  about  each  other <period> the  americans  think  that  the  european  model  is  going  to  crumble  tomorrow <period> the  europeans  think  that  the  american  budget  is  going  to  explode  tomorrow <period> and  that  's  all  we  seem  to  be  caring  about  recently <period> nf <comma> i  think  the  fiscal  crisis  that  we  see  in  the  developed  world  right  now <comma> both  sides  of  the  atlantic <comma> is  essentially  the  same  thing  taking  different  forms  in  terms  of  political  culture <period> and  it  's  a  crisis  that  has  its  structural  facet <comma> it  's  partly  to  do  with  demographics <period> but  it  's  also <comma> of  course <comma> to  do  with  the  massive  crisis  that  followed  excessive  leverage <comma> excessive  borrowing  in  the  private  sector <period> that  crisis <comma> which  has  been  the  focus  of  so  much  attention <comma> including  by  me <comma> i  think  is  an  epiphenomenon <period> the  financial  crisis  is  really  a  relatively  small  historic  phenomenon <comma> which  has  just  accelerated  this  huge  shift <comma> which  ends  half  a  millennium  of  western  ascendancy <period> i  think  that  's  its  real  importance <period> bg <comma> niall <comma> thank  you <period> what  technology  can  we  really  apply  to  reducing  global  poverty <questionmark> and  what  i  found  was  quite  surprising <period> we  started  looking  at  things  like  death  rates  in  the  20th  century <comma> and  how  they'd  been  improved <comma> and  very  simple  things  turned  out <period> you'd  think  maybe  antibiotics  made  more  difference  than  clean  water <comma> but  it  's  actually  the  opposite <period> and  so  very  simple  things <comma> off-the-shelf  technologies  that  we  could  easily  find  on  the  then-early  web <comma> would  clearly  make  a  huge  difference  to  that  problem <period> but  i  also <comma> in  looking  at  more  powerful  technologies  and  nanotechnology  and  genetic  engineering  and  other  new  emerging  kind  of  digital  technologies <comma> became  very  concerned  about  the  potential  for  abuse <period> if  you  think  about  it <comma> in  history <comma> a  long <comma> long  time  ago  we  dealt  with  the  problem  of  an  individual  abusing  another  individual <period> we  came  up  with  something <comma> the  ten  commandments <comma> thou  shalt  not  kill <period> that  's  a <comma> kind  of  a  one-on-one  thing <period> we  organized  into  cities <period> we  had  many  people <period> and  to  keep  the  many  from  tyrannizing  the  one <comma> we  came  up  with  concepts  like  individual  liberty <period> and  then <comma> to  have  to  deal  with  large  groups <comma> say <comma> at  the  nation-state  level <comma> and  we  had  to  have  mutual  non-aggression <comma> or  through  a  series  of  conflicts <comma> we  eventually  came  to  a  rough  international  bargain  to  largely  keep  the  peace <period> but  now  we  have  a  new  situation <comma> really  what  people  call  an  asymmetric  situation <comma> where  technology  is  so  powerful  that  it  extends  beyond  a  nation-state <period> it  's  not  the  nation-states  that  have  potential  access  to  mass  destruction <comma> but  individuals <period> and  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  fact  that  these  new  technologies  tend  to  be  digital <period> we  saw  genome  sequences <period> you  can  download  the  gene  sequences  of  pathogens  off  the  internet  if  you  want  to <comma> and  clearly  someone  recently <comma> i  saw  in  a  science  magazine <comma> they  said <comma> well <comma> the  1918  flu  is  too  dangerous  to  fedex  around <period> if  people  want  to  use  it  in  their  labs  for  working  on  research <comma> just  reconstruct  it  yourself <comma> because <comma> you  know <comma> it  might  break  in  fedex <period> so  that  this  is  possible  to  do  this  is  not  deniable <period> so  individuals  in  small  groups  super-empowered  by  access  to  these  kinds  of  self-replicating  technologies <comma> whether  it  be  biological  or  other <comma> are  clearly  a  danger  in  our  world <period> and  the  danger  is  that  they  can  cause  roughly  what  's  a  pandemic <period> and  we  really  do  n't  have  experience  with  pandemics <period> and  we  're  also  not  very  good  as  a  society  at  acting  to  things  we  do  n't  have  direct  and  sort  of  gut-level  experience  with <period> so  it  's  not  in  our  nature  to  pre-act <period> and  in  this  case <comma> piling  on  more  technology  does  n't  solve  the  problem <comma> because  it  only  super-empowers  people  more <period> so  the  solution  has  to  be <comma> as  people  like  russell  and  einstein  and  others  imagine  in  a  conversation  that  existed  in  a  much  stronger  form <comma> i  think <comma> early  in  the  20th  century <comma> that  the  solution  had  to  be  not  just  the  head  but  the  heart <period> you  know <comma> public  policy  and  moral  progress <period> the  bargain  that  gives  us  civilization  is  a  bargain  to  not  use  power <period> we  get  our  individual  rights  by  society  protecting  us  from  others  not  doing  everything  they  can  do  but  largely  doing  only  what  is  legal <period> and  so  to  limit  the  danger  of  these  new  things <comma> we  have  to  limit <comma> ultimately <comma> the  ability  of  individuals  to  have  access <comma> essentially <comma> to  pandemic  power <period> we  also  have  to  have  sensible  defense <comma> because  no  limitation  is  going  to  prevent  a  crazy  person  from  doing  something <period> and  you  know <comma> and  the  troubling  thing  is  that  it  's  much  easier  to  do  something  bad  than  to  defend  against  all  possible  bad  things <comma> so  the  offensive  uses  really  have  an  asymmetric  advantage <period> so  these  are  the  kind  of  thoughts  i  was  thinking  in  1999  and  2000 <comma> and  my  friends  told  me  i  was  getting  really  depressed <comma> and  they  were  really  worried  about  me <period> and  then  i  signed  a  book  contract  to  write  more  gloomy  thoughts  about  this  and  moved  into  a  hotel  room  in  new  york  with  one  room  full  of  books  on  the  plague <comma> and  you  know <comma> nuclear  bombs  exploding  in  new  york  where  i  would  be  within  the  circle <comma> and  so  on <period> and  then  i  was  there  on  september  11th <comma> and  i  stood  in  the  streets  with  everyone <period> and  it  was  quite  an  experience  to  be  there <period> i  got  up  the  next  morning  and  walked  out  of  the  city <comma> and  all  the  sanitation  trucks  were  parked  on  houston  street  and  ready  to  go  down  and  start  taking  the  rubble  away <period> and  i  walked  down  the  middle <comma> up  to  the  train  station <comma> and  everything  below  14th  street  was  closed <period> it  was  quite  a  compelling  experience <comma> but  not  really <comma> i  suppose <comma> a  surprise  to  someone  who'd  had  his  room  full  of  the  books <period> it  was  always  a  surprise  that  it  happened  then  and  there <comma> but  it  was  n't  a  surprise  that  it  happened  at  all <period> and  everyone  then  started  writing  about  this <period> thousands  of  people  started  writing  about  this <period> and  i  eventually  abandoned  the  book <comma> and  then  chris  called  me  to  talk  at  the  conference <period> i  really  do  n't  talk  about  this  anymore  because <comma> you  know <comma> there  's  enough  frustrating  and  depressing  things  going  on <period> but  i  agreed  to  come  and  say  a  few  things  about  this <period> and  i  would  say  that  we  cannot  give  up  the  rule  of  law  to  fight  an  asymmetric  threat <comma> which  is  what  we  seem  to  be  doing  because  of  the  present <comma> the  people  that  are  in  power <comma> because  that  's  to  give  up  the  thing  that  makes  civilization <period> and  we  cannot  fight  the  threat  in  the  kind  of  stupid  way  we  're  doing <comma> because  a  million-dollar  act  causes  a  billion  dollars  of  damage <comma> causes  a  trillion  dollar  response  which  is  largely  ineffective  and  arguably <comma> probably  almost  certainly <comma> has  made  the  problem  worse <period> so  we  cannot  fight  the  thing  with  a  million-to-one  cost <comma> one-to-a-million  cost-benefit  ratio <period> so  after  giving  up  on  the  book <comma> and  i  had  the  great  honor  to  be  able  to  join  kleiner  perkins  about  a  year  ago <period> and  to  work  through  venture  capital  on  the  innovative  side <comma> and  to  try  to  find  some  innovations  that  could  address  what  i  saw  as  some  of  these  big  problems <period> things  where <comma> you  know <comma> a  factor  of  10  difference  can  make  a  factor  of  1,000  difference  in  the  outcome <period> i've  been  amazed  in  the  last  year  at  the  incredible  quality  and  excitement  of  the  innovations  that  have  come  across  my  desk <period> it  's  overwhelming  at  times <period> i  'm  very  thankful  for  google  and  wikipedia  so  i  can  understand  at  least  a  little  of  what  people  are  talking  about  who  come  through  the  doors <period> but  i  wanted  to  share  with  you  three  areas  that  i  'm  particularly  excited  about  and  that  relate  to  the  problems  that  i  was  talking  about  in  the  wired  article <period> the  first  is  this  whole  area  of  education <comma> and  it  really  relates  to  what  nicholas  was  talking  about  with  a  $100  computer <period> and  that  is  to  say  that  there  's  a  lot  of  legs  left  in  moore  's  law <period> the  most  advanced  transistors  today  are  at  65  nanometers <comma> and  we've  seen <comma> and  i've  had  the  pleasure  to  invest  in <comma> companies  that  give  me  great  confidence  that  we  'll  extend  moore  's  law  all  the  way  down  to  roughly  the  10  nanometer  scale <period> another  factor  of <comma> say <comma> six  in  dimensional  reduction <comma> which  should  give  us  about  another  factor  of  100  in  raw  improvement  in  what  the  chips  can  do <period> and  so <comma> to  put  that  in  practical  terms <comma> if  something  costs  about  1,000  dollars  today <comma> say <comma> the  best  personal  computer  you  can  buy <comma> that  might  be  its  cost <comma> i  think  we  can  have  that  in  2020  for  10  dollars <period> okay <questionmark> now <comma> just  imagine  what  that  $100  computer  will  be  in  2020  as  a  tool  for  education <period> i  think  the  challenge  for  us  is <comma> i  'm  very  certain  that  that  will  happen <comma> the  challenge  is <comma> will  we  develop  the  kind  of  educational  tools  and  things  with  the  net  to  let  us  take  advantage  of  that  device <questionmark> i'd  argue  today  that  we  have  incredibly  powerful  computers <comma> but  we  do  n't  have  very  good  software  for  them <period> and  it  's  only  in  retrospect <comma> after  the  better  software  comes  along <comma> and  you  take  it  and  you  run  it  on  a  ten-year-old  machine <comma> you  say <comma> god <comma> the  machine  was  that  fast <questionmark> i  remember  when  they  took  the  apple  mac  interface  and  they  put  it  back  on  the  apple  ii <period> the  apple  ii  was  perfectly  capable  of  running  that  kind  of  interface <comma> we  just  did  n't  know  how  to  do  it  at  the  time <period> so  given  that  we  know  and  should  believe <comma> because  moore  's  law  's  been <comma> like <comma> a  constant <comma> i  mean <comma> it  's  just  been  very  predictable  progress  over  the  last  40  years  or  whatever <period> we  can  know  what  the  computers  are  going  to  be  like  in  2020 <period> it  's  great  that  we  have  initiatives  to  say <comma> let  's  go  create  the  education  and  educate  people  in  the  world <comma> because  that  's  a  great  force  for  peace <period> and  we  can  give  everyone  in  the  world  a  $100  computer  or  a  $10  computer  in  the  next  15  years <period> the  second  area  that  i  'm  focusing  on  is  the  environmental  problem <comma> because  that  's  clearly  going  to  put  a  lot  of  pressure  on  this  world <period> we  'll  hear  a  lot  more  about  that  from  al  gore  very  shortly <period> the  thing  that  we  see  as  the  kind  of  moore  's  law  trend  that  's  driving  improvement  in  our  ability  to  address  the  environmental  problem  is  new  materials <period> we  have  a  challenge <comma> because  the  urban  population  is  growing  in  this  century  from  two  billion  to  six  billion  in  a  very  short  amount  of  time <period> people  are  moving  to  the  cities <period> they  all  need  clean  water <comma> they  need  energy <comma> they  need  transportation <comma> and  we  want  them  to  develop  in  a  green  way <period> we  're  reasonably  efficient  in  the  industrial  sectors <period> we've  made  improvements  in  energy  and  resource  efficiency <comma> but  the  consumer  sector <comma> especially  in  america <comma> is  very  inefficient <period> but  these  new  materials  bring  such  incredible  innovations  that  there  's  a  strong  basis  for  hope  that  these  things  will  be  so  profitable  that  they  can  be  brought  to  the  market <period> and  i  want  to  give  you  a  specific  example  of  a  new  material  that  was  discovered  15  years  ago <period> if  we  take  carbon  nanotubes <comma> you  know <comma> iijima  discovered  them  in  1991 <comma> they  just  have  incredible  properties <period> and  these  are  the  kinds  of  things  we  're  going  to  discover  as  we  start  to  engineer  at  the  nano  scale <period> their  strength <comma> they  're  almost  the  strongest  material <comma> tensile  strength  material  known <period> they  're  very <comma> very  stiff <period> they  stretch  very <comma> very  little <period> in  two  dimensions <comma> if  you  make <comma> like <comma> a  fabric  out  of  them <comma> they  're  30  times  stronger  than  kevlar <period> and  if  you  make  a  three-dimensional  structure <comma> like  a  buckyball <comma> they  have  all  sorts  of  incredible  properties <period> if  you  shoot  a  particle  at  them  and  knock  a  hole  in  them <comma> they  repair  themselves <period> they  go  zip  and  they  repair  the  hole  in  femtoseconds <comma> which  is  not <comma> is  really  quick <period> if  you  shine  a  light  on  them <comma> they  produce  electricity <period> in  fact <comma> if  you  flash  them  with  a  camera  they  catch  on  fire <period> if  you  put  electricity  on  them <comma> they  emit  light <period> if  you  run  current  through  them <comma> you  can  run  1,000  times  more  current  through  one  of  these  than  through  a  piece  of  metal <period> you  can  make  both  p-  and  n-type  semiconductors <comma> which  means  you  can  make  transistors  out  of  them <period> they  conduct  heat  along  their  length  but  not  across <comma> well <comma> there  is  no  width <comma> but  not  in  the  other  direction  if  you  stack  them  up <period> that  's  a  property  of  carbon  fiber  also <period> if  you  put  particles  in  them <comma> and  they  go  shooting  out  the  tip <comma> they  're  like  miniature  linear  accelerators  or  electron  guns <period> the  inside  of  the  nanotubes  is  so  small <comma> the  smallest  ones  are  07  nanometers <comma> that  it  's  basically  a  quantum  world <period> it  's  a  strange  place  inside  a  nanotube <period> and  so  we  begin  to  see <comma> and  we've  seen  business  plans  already <comma> where  the  kind  of  things  lisa  randall  's  talking  about  are  in  there <period> i  had  one  business  plan  where  i  was  trying  to  learn  more  about  witten  's  cosmic  dimension  strings  to  try  to  understand  what  the  phenomenon  was  going  on  in  this  proposed  nanomaterial <period> so  inside  of  a  nanotube <comma> we  're  really  at  the  limit  here <period> so  what  we  see  is  with  these  and  other  new  materials  that  we  can  do  things  with  different  properties <comma> lighter <comma> stronger <comma> and  apply  these  new  materials  to  the  environmental  problems <period> new  materials  that  can  make  water <comma> new  materials  that  can  make  fuel  cells  work  better <comma> new  materials  that  catalyze  chemical  reactions <comma> that  cut  pollution  and  so  on <period> ethanol <comma> new  ways  of  making  ethanol <period> new  ways  of  making  electric  transportation <period> the  whole  green  dream <comma> because  it  can  be  profitable <period> and  we've  dedicated <comma> we've  just  raised  a  new  fund <comma> we  dedicated  100  million  dollars  to  these  kinds  of  investments <period> we  believe  that  genentech <comma> the  compaq <comma> the  lotus <comma> the  sun <comma> the  netscape <comma> the  amazon <comma> the  google  in  these  fields  are  yet  to  be  found <comma> because  this  materials  revolution  will  drive  these  things  forward <period> the  third  area  that  we  're  working  on <comma> and  we  just  announced  last  week <comma> we  were  all  in  new  york <period> we  raised  200  million  dollars  in  a  specialty  fund  to  work  on  a  pandemic  in  biodefense <period> and  to  give  you  an  idea  of  the  last  fund  that  kleiner  raised  was  a  $400  million  fund <comma> so  this  for  us  is  a  very  substantial  fund <period> and  what  we  did <comma> over  the  last  few  months <comma> well <comma> a  few  months  ago <comma> ray  kurzweil  and  i  wrote  an  op-ed  in  the  new  york  times  about  how  publishing  the  1918  genome  was  very  dangerous <period> and  john  doerr  and  brook  and  others  got  concerned <comma> unclear <comma> and  we  started  looking  around  at  what  the  world  was  doing  about  being  prepared  for  a  pandemic <period> and  we  saw  a  lot  of  gaps <period> and  so  we  asked  ourselves <comma> you  know <comma> can  we  find  innovative  things  that  will  go  fill  these  gaps <questionmark> and  brooks  told  me  in  a  break  here <comma> he  said  he  's  found  so  much  stuff  he  cannot  sleep <period> because  there  's  so  many  great  technologies  out  there <comma> we  're  essentially  buried <period> and  we  need  them <comma> you  know <period> we  have  one  antiviral  that  people  are  talking  about  stockpiling  that  still  works <comma> roughly <period> that  's  tamiflu <period> but  tamiflu <comma> the  virus  is  resistant <period> it  is  resistant  to  tamiflu <period> we've  discovered  with  aids  we  need  cocktails  to  work  well  so  that  the  viral  resistance <comma> we  need  several  anti-virals <period> we  need  better  surveillance <period> we  need  networks  that  can  find  out  what  's  going  on <period> we  need  rapid  diagnostics  so  that  we  can  tell  if  somebody  has  a  strain  of  flu  which  we  have  only  identified  very  recently <period> we've  got  to  be  able  to  make  the  rapid  diagnostics  quickly <period> we  need  new  anti-virals  and  cocktails <period> we  need  new  kinds  of  vaccines <period> vaccines  that  are  broad  spectrum <period> vaccines  that  we  can  manufacture  quickly <period> cocktails <comma> more  polyvalent  vaccines <period> you  normally  get  a  trivalent  vaccine  against  three  possible  strains <period> we  need <comma> we  do  n't  know  where  this  thing  is  going <period> we  believe  that  if  we  could  fill  these  10  gaps <comma> we  have  a  chance  to  help  really  reduce  the  risk  of  a  pandemic <period> and  the  difference  between  a  normal  flu  season  and  a  pandemic  is  about  a  factor  of  1,000  in  deaths  and  certainly  enormous  economic  impact <period> so  we  're  very  excited  because  we  think  we  can  fund  10 <comma> or  speed  up  10  projects  and  see  them  come  to  market  in  the  next  couple  years  that  will  address  this <period> so  if  we  can  address <comma> use  technology <comma> help  address  education <comma> help  address  the  environment <comma> help  address  the  pandemic <comma> does  that  solve  the  larger  problem  that  i  was  talking  about  in  the  wired  article <questionmark> and  i  'm  afraid  the  answer  is  really  no <period> because  you  cannot  solve  a  problem  with  the  management  of  technology  with  more  technology <period> if  we  let  an  unlimited  amount  of  power  loose <comma> then  we  will <comma> a  very  small  number  of  people  will  be  able  to  abuse  it <period> we  cannot  fight  at  a  million-to-one  disadvantage <period> so  what  we  need  to  do  is <comma> we  need  better  policy <period> and  for  example <comma> some  things  we  could  do  that  would  be  policy  solutions  which  are  not  really  in  the  political  air  right  now  but  perhaps  with  the  change  of  administration  would  be <comma> use  markets <period> markets  are  a  very  strong  force <period> for  example <comma> rather  than  trying  to  regulate  away  problems <comma> which  probably  wo  n't  work <comma> if  we  could  price  into  the  cost  of  doing  business <comma> the  cost  of  catastrophe <comma> so  that  people  who  are  doing  things  that  had  a  higher  cost  of  catastrophe  would  have  to  take  insurance  against  that  risk <period> so  if  you  wanted  to  put  a  drug  on  the  market  you  could  put  it  on <period> but  it  would  n't  have  to  be  approved  by  regulators <period> you'd  have  to  convince  an  actuary  that  it  would  be  safe <period> and  if  you  apply  the  notion  of  insurance  more  broadly <comma> you  can  use  a  more  powerful  force <comma> a  market  force <comma> to  provide  feedback <period> how  could  you  keep  the  law <questionmark> i  think  the  law  would  be  a  really  good  thing  to  keep <period> well <comma> you  have  to  hold  people  accountable <period> the  law  requires  accountability <period> today  scientists <comma> technologists <comma> businessmen <comma> engineers  do  n't  have  any  personal  responsibility  for  the  consequences  of  their  actions <period> so  if  you  tie  that <comma> you  have  to  tie  that  back  with  the  law <period> and  finally <comma> i  think  we  have  to  do  something  that  's  not  really <comma> it  's  almost  unacceptable  to  say  this <comma> which <comma> we  have  to  begin  to  design  the  future <period> we  cannot  pick  the  future <comma> but  we  can  steer  the  future <period> our  investment  in  trying  to  prevent  pandemic  flu  is  affecting  the  distribution  of  possible  outcomes <period> we  may  not  be  able  to  stop  it <comma> but  the  likelihood  that  it  will  get  past  us  is  lower  if  we  focus  on  that  problem <period> so  we  can  design  the  future  if  we  choose  what  kind  of  things  we  want  to  have  happen  and  not  have  happen <comma> and  steer  us  to  a  lower-risk  place <period> vice  president  gore  will  talk  about  how  we  could  steer  the  climate  trajectory  into  a  lower  probability  of  catastrophic  risk <period> but  above  all <comma> what  we  have  to  do  is  we  have  to  help  the  good  guys <comma> the  people  on  the  defensive  side <comma> have  an  advantage  over  the  people  who  want  to  abuse  things <period> and  what  we  have  to  do  to  do  that  is  we  have  to  limit  access  to  certain  information <period> and  growing  up  as  we  have <comma> and  holding  very  high  the  value  of  free  speech <comma> this  is  a  hard  thing  for  us  to  accept <comma> for  all  of  us  to  accept <period> it  's  especially  hard  for  the  scientists  to  accept  who  still  remember <comma> you  know <comma> galileo  essentially  locked  up <comma> and  who  are  still  fighting  this  battle  against  the  church <period> but  that  's  the  price  of  having  a  civilization <period> the  price  of  retaining  the  rule  of  law  is  to  limit  the  access  to  the  great  and  kind  of  unbridled  power <period> thank  you <period> imagine  spending  seven  years  at  mit  and  research  laboratories <comma> only  to  find  out  that  you  're  a  performance  artist <period> i  'm  also  a  software  engineer <comma> and  i  make  lots  of  different  kinds  of  art  with  the  computer <period> and  i  think  the  main  thing  that  i  'm  interested  in  is  trying  to  find  a  way  of  making  the  computer  into  a  personal  mode  of  expression <period> and  many  of  you  out  there  are  the  heads  of  macromedia  and  microsoft <comma> and  in  a  way  those  are  my  bane: <period> i  think  there  's  a  great  homogenizing  force  that  software  imposes  on  people  and  limits  the  way  they  think  about  what  's  possible  on  the  computer <period> of  course <comma> it  's  also  a  great  liberating  force  that  makes  possible <comma> you  know <comma> publishing  and  so  forth <comma> and  standards <comma> and  so  on <period> but <comma> in  a  way <comma> the  computer  makes  possible  much  more  than  what  most  people  think <comma> and  my  art  has  just  been  about  trying  to  find  a  personal  way  of  using  the  computer <comma> and  so  i  end  up  writing  software  to  do  that <period> chris  has  asked  me  to  do  a  short  performance <comma> and  so  i  'm  going  to  take  just  this  time <comma> maybe  10  minutes <comma> to  do  that <comma> and  hopefully  at  the  end  have  just  a  moment  to  show  you  a  couple  of  my  other  projects  in  video  form <period> thank  you <period> we've  got  about  a  minute  left <period> i'd  just  like  to  show  a  clip  from  a  most  recent  project <period> i  did  a  performance  with  two  singers  who  specialize  in  making  strange  noises  with  their  mouths <period> and  this  just  came  off  last  september  at  ars  electronica <period> we  repeated  it  in  england <period> and  the  idea  is  to  visualize  their  speech  and  song  behind  them  with  a  large  screen <period> we  used  a  computer  vision  tracking  system  in  order  to  know  where  they  were <period> and  since  we  know  where  their  heads  are <comma> and  we  have  a  wireless  mic  on  them  that  we  're  processing  the  sound  from <comma> we  're  able  to  create  visualizations  which  are  linked  very  tightly  to  what  they  're  doing  with  their  speech <period> this  will  take  about  30  seconds  or  so <period> he  's  making  a <comma> kind  of <comma> cheek-flapping  sound <period> well <comma> suffice  it  to  say  it  's  not  all  like  that <comma> but  that  's  part  of  it <period> thanks  very  much <period> there  's  always  lots  more <period> i  'm  overtime <comma> so  i  just  wanted  to  say  you  can <comma> if  you  're  in  new  york <comma> you  can  check  out  my  work  at  the  whitney  biennial  next  week <comma> and  also  at  bitforms  gallery  in  chelsea <period> and  with  that <comma> i  think  i  should  give  up  the  stage <period> so <comma> thank  you  so  much <period> so  sometimes  i  get  invited  to  give  weird  talks <period> i  got  invited  to  speak  to  the  people  who  dress  up  in  big  stuffed  animal  costumes  to  perform  at  sporting  events <period> unfortunately  i  could  n't  go <period> but  it  got  me  thinking  about  the  fact  that  these  guys <comma> at  least  most  of  them <comma> know  what  it  is  that  they  do  for  a  living <period> what  they  do  is  they  dress  up  as  stuffed  animals  and  entertain  people  at  sporting  events <period> shortly  after  that  i  got  invited  to  speak  at  the  convention  of  the  people  who  make  balloon  animals <period> and  again <comma> i  could  n't  go <period> but  it  's  a  fascinating  group <period> they  make  balloon  animals <period> there  is  a  big  schism  between  the  ones  who  make  gospel  animals  and  porn  animals <comma> but  -- <period> they  do  a  lot  of  really  cool  stuff  with  balloons <period> sometimes  they  get  in  trouble <comma> but  not  often <period> and  the  other  thing  about  these  guys  is <comma> they  also  know  what  they  do  for  a  living <period> they  make  balloon  animals <period> but  what  do  we  do  for  a  living <questionmark> what  exactly  to  the  people  watching  this  do  every  day <questionmark> and  i  want  to  argue  that  what  we  do  is  we  try  to  change  everything <period> that  we  try  to  find  a  piece  of  the  status  quo <comma> something  that  bothers  us <comma> something  that  needs  to  be  improved <comma> something  that  is  itching  to  be  changed <comma> and  we  change  it <period> we  try  to  make  big <comma> permanent <comma> important  change <period> but  we  do  n't  think  about  it  that  way <period> and  we  have  n't  spent  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  what  that  process  is  like <period> and  i've  been  studying  it  for  a  couple  years <period> and  i  want  to  share  a  couple  stories  with  you  today <period> first <comma> about  a  guy  named  nathan  winograd <period> nathan  was  the  number  two  person  at  the  san  francisco  spca <period> and  what  you  may  not  know  about  the  history  of  the  spca  is <comma> it  was  founded  to  kill  dogs  and  cats <period> cities  gave  them  a  charter  to  get  rid  of  the  stray  animals  on  the  street  and  destroy  them <period> in  a  typical  year  four  million  dogs  and  cats  were  killed <comma> most  of  them  within  24  hours  of  being  scooped  off  of  the  street <period> nathan  and  his  boss  saw  this <period> and  they  could  not  tolerate  it <period> so  they  set  out  to  make  san  francisco  a  no-kill  city: <period> create  an  entire  city  where  every  dog  and  cat <comma> unless  it  was  ill  or  dangerous <comma> would  be  adopted <comma> not  killed <period> and  everyone  said  it  was  impossible <period> nathan  and  his  boss  went  to  the  city  council  to  get  a  change  in  the  ordinance <period> and  people  from  spcas  and  humane  shelters  around  the  country  flew  to  san  francisco  to  testify  against  them <comma> to  say  it  would  hurt  the  movement  and  it  was  inhumane <period> they  persisted <period> and  nathan  went  directly  to  the  community <period> he  connected  with  people  who  cared  about  this: <period> nonprofessionals <comma> people  with  passion <period> and  within  just  a  couple  years <comma> san  francisco  became  the  first  no-kill  city <period> running  no  deficit <comma> completely  supported  by  the  community <period> nathan  left  and  went  to  tompkins  county <comma> new  york  -- <period> a  place  as  different  from  san  francisco  as  you  can  be  and  still  be  in  the  united  states <period> and  he  did  it  again <period> he  went  from  being  a  glorified  dogcatcher  to  completely  transforming  the  community <period> and  then  he  went  to  north  carolina  and  did  it  again <period> and  he  went  to  reno  and  he  did  it  again <period> and  when  i  think  about  what  nathan  did <comma> and  when  i  think  about  what  people  here  do <comma> i  think  about  ideas <period> and  i  think  about  the  idea  that  creating  an  idea <comma> spreading  an  idea  has  a  lot  behind  it <period> i  do  n't  know  if  you've  ever  been  to  a  jewish  wedding <period> but  what  they  do  is <comma> they  take  a  light  bulb  and  they  smash  it <period> now  there  is  a  bunch  of  reasons  for  that <comma> and  stories  about  it <period> but  one  reason  is  because  it  indicates  a  change <comma> from  before  to  after <period> it  is  a  moment  in  time <period> and  i  want  to  argue  that  we  are  living  through  and  are  right  at  the  key  moment  of  a  change  in  the  way  ideas  are  created  and  spread  and  implemented <period> we  started  with  the  factory  idea: <period> that  you  could  change  the  whole  world  if  you  had  an  efficient  factory  that  could  churn  out  change <period> we  then  went  to  the  tv  idea <period> that  said  if  you  had  a  big  enough  mouthpiece <comma> if  you  could  get  on  tv  enough  times <comma> if  you  could  buy  enough  ads <comma> you  could  win <period> and  now  we  're  in  this  new  model  of  leadership <period> where  the  way  we  make  change  is  not  by  using  money  or  power  to  lever  a  system <comma> but  by  leading <period> so  let  me  tell  you  about  the  three  cycles <period> the  first  one  is  the  factory  cycle <period> henry  ford  comes  up  with  a  really  cool  idea <period> it  enables  him  to  hire  men  who  used  to  get  paid  50  cents  a  day  and  pay  them  five  dollars  a  day <period> because  he  's  got  an  efficient  enough  factory <period> well  with  that  sort  of  advantage  you  can  churn  out  a  lot  of  cars <period> you  can  make  a  lot  of  change <period> you  can  get  roads  built <period> you  can  change  the  fabric  of  an  entire  country <period> that  the  essence  of  what  you  're  doing  is  you  need  ever-cheaper  labor <comma> and  ever-faster  machines <period> and  the  problem  we've  run  into  is <comma> we  're  running  out  of  both <period> ever-cheaper  labor  and  ever-faster  machines <period> so  we  shift  gears  for  a  minute <comma> and  say <comma> i  know <comma> television <period> advertising <period> push  push <period> take  a  good  idea  and  push  it  on  the  world <period> i  have  a  better  mousetrap <period> and  if  i  can  just  get  enough  money  to  tell  enough  people <comma> i  'll  sell  enough <period> and  you  can  build  an  entire  industry  on  that <period> if  necessary  you  can  put  babies  in  your  ads <period> if  necessary  you  can  use  babies  to  sell  other  stuff <period> and  if  babies  do  n't  work <comma> you  can  use  doctors <period> but  be  careful <period> because  you  do  n't  want  to  get  an  unfortunate  juxtaposition <comma> where  you  're  talking  about  one  thing  instead  of  the  other <period> this  model  requires  you  to  act  like  the  king <comma> like  the  person  in  the  front  of  the  room  throwing  things  to  the  peons  in  the  back <period> that  you  are  in  charge <comma> and  you  're  going  to  tell  people  what  to  do  next <period> the  quick  little  diagram  of  it  is <comma> you  're  up  here <comma> and  you  are  pushing  it  out  to  the  world <period> this  method <comma> mass  marketing <comma> requires  average  ideas <comma> because  you  're  going  to  the  masses <comma> and  plenty  of  ads <period> what  we've  done  as  spammers  is  tried  to  hypnotize  everyone  into  buying  our  idea <period> hypnotize  everyone  into  donating  to  our  cause <period> hypnotize  everyone  into  voting  for  our  candidate <period> and <comma> unfortunately <comma> it  does  n't  work  so  well  anymore  either <period> but  there  is  good  news  around  the  corner <comma> really  good  news <period> i  call  it  the  idea  of  tribes <period> what  tribes  are <comma> is  a  very  simple  concept  that  goes  back  50,000  years <period> it  's  about  leading  and  connecting  people  and  ideas <period> and  it  's  something  that  people  have  wanted  forever <period> lots  of  people  are  used  to  having  a  spiritual  tribe <comma> or  a  church  tribe <comma> having  a  work  tribe <comma> having  a  community  tribe <period> but  now <comma> thanks  to  the  internet <comma> thanks  to  the  explosion  of  mass  media <comma> thanks  to  a  lot  of  other  things  that  are  bubbling  through  our  society  around  the  world <comma> tribes  are  everywhere <period> the  internet  was  supposed  to  homogenize  everyone  by  connecting  us  all <period> instead  what  it  's  allowed  is  silos  of  interest <period> so  you've  got  the  red-hat  ladies  over  here <period> you've  got  the  red-hat  triathletes  over  there <period> you've  got  the  organized  armies  over  here <period> you've  got  the  disorganized  rebels  over  here <period> you've  got  people  in  white  hats  making  food <period> and  people  in  white  hats  sailing  boats <period> the  point  is  that  you  can  find  ukrainian  folk  dancers  and  connect  with  them <period> because  you  want  to  be  connected <period> that  people  on  the  fringes  can  find  each  other <comma> connect  and  go  somewhere <period> every  town  that  has  a  volunteer  fire  department  understands  this  way  of  thinking <period> now  it  turns  out  this  is  a  legitimate  non-photoshopped  photo <period> people  i  know  who  are  firemen  told  me  that  this  is  not  uncommon <period> and  that  what  firemen  do  to  train  sometimes  is  they  take  a  house  that  is  going  to  be  torn  down <comma> and  they  burn  it  down  instead <comma> and  practice  putting  it  out <period> but  they  always  stop  and  take  a  picture <period> you  know  the  pirate  tribe  is  a  fascinating  one <period> they've  got  their  own  flag <period> they've  got  the  eye  patches <period> you  can  tell  when  you  're  running  into  someone  in  a  tribe <period> and  it  turns  out  that  it  's  tribes <comma> not  money <comma> not  factories <comma> that  can  change  our  world <comma> that  can  change  politics <comma> that  can  align  large  numbers  of  people <period> not  because  you  force  them  to  do  something  against  their  will <period> but  because  they  wanted  to  connect <period> that  what  we  do  for  a  living  now <comma> all  of  us <comma> i  think <comma> is  find  something  worth  changing <comma> and  then  assemble  tribes  that  assemble  tribes  that  spread  the  idea  and  spread  the  idea <period> and  it  becomes  something  far  bigger  than  ourselves <period> it  becomes  a  movement <period> so  when  al  gore  set  out  to  change  the  world  again <comma> he  did  n't  do  it  by  himself <period> and  he  did  n't  do  it  by  buying  a  lot  of  ads <period> he  did  it  by  creating  a  movement <period> thousands  of  people  around  the  country  who  could  give  his  presentation  for  him <period> because  he  cannot  be  in  100  or  200  or  500  cities  in  each  night <period> you  do  n't  need  everyone <period> what  kevin  kelley  has  taught  us  is  you  just  need <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> a  thousand  true  fans  -- <period> a  thousand  people  who  care  enough  that  they  will  get  you  the  next  round  and  the  next  round  and  the  next  round <period> and  that  means  that  the  idea  you  create <comma> the  product  you  create <comma> the  movement  you  create  is  n't  for  everyone <period> it  's  not  a  mass  thing <period> that  's  not  what  this  is  about <period> what  it  's  about  instead  is  finding  the  true  believers <period> it  's  easy  to  look  at  what  i've  said  so  far <comma> and  say <comma> wait  a  minute <comma> i  do  n't  have  what  it  takes  to  be  that  kind  of  leader <period> so  here  are  two  leaders <period> they  do  n't  have  a  lot  in  common <period> they  're  about  the  same  age <period> but  that  's  about  it <period> what  they  did <comma> though <comma> is  each  in  their  own  way <comma> created  a  different  way  of  navigating  your  way  through  technology <period> so  some  people  will  go  out  and  get  people  to  be  on  one  team <period> and  some  people  will  get  people  to  be  on  the  other  team <period> it  also  informs  the  decisions  you  make  when  you  make  products  or  services <period> you  know <comma> this  is  one  of  my  favorite  devices <period> but  what  a  shame  that  it  's  not  organized  to  help  authors  create  movements <period> what  would  happen  if <comma> when  you  're  using  your  kindle <comma> you  could  see  the  comments  and  quotes  and  notes  from  all  the  other  people  reading  the  same  book  as  you  in  that  moment <period> or  from  your  book  group <period> or  from  your  friends <comma> or  from  the  circle  you  want <period> what  would  happen  if  authors <comma> or  people  with  ideas  could  use  version  two <comma> which  comes  out  on  monday <comma> and  use  it  to  organize  people  who  want  to  talk  about  something <period> now  there  is  a  million  things  i  could  share  with  you  about  the  mechanics  here <period> but  let  me  just  try  a  couple <period> the  beatles  did  not  invent  teenagers <period> they  merely  decided  to  lead  them <period> that  most  movements <comma> most  leadership  that  we  're  doing  is  about  finding  a  group  that  's  disconnected  but  already  has  a  yearning  -- <period> not  persuading  people  to  want  something  they  do  n't  have  yet <period> when  diane  hatz  worked  on  the  meatrix <comma> her  video  that  spread  all  across  the  internet  about  the  way  farm  animals  are  treated <comma> she  did  n't  invent  the  idea  of  being  a  vegan <period> she  did  n't  invent  the  idea  of  caring  about  this  issue <period> but  she  helped  organize  people <comma> and  helped  turn  it  into  a  movement <period> hugo  chavez  did  not  invent  the  disaffected  middle  and  lower  class  of  venezuela <period> he  merely  led  them <period> bob  marley  did  not  invent  rastafarians <period> he  just  stepped  up  and  said <comma> follow  me <period> derek  sivers  invented  cd  baby <comma> which  allowed  independent  musicians  to  have  a  place  to  sell  their  music  without  selling  out  to  the  man  -- <period> to  have  place  to  take  the  mission  they  already  wanted  to  go  to <comma> and  connect  with  each  other <period> what  all  these  people  have  in  common  is  that  they  are  heretics <period> that  heretics  look  at  the  status  quo  and  say <comma> this  will  not  stand <period> i  cannot  abide  this  status  quo <period> i  am  willing  to  stand  up  and  be  counted  and  move  things  forward <period> i  see  what  the  status  quo  is <period> i  do  n't  like  it <period> that  instead  of  looking  at  all  the  little  rules  and  following  each  one  of  them <comma> that  instead  of  being  what  i  call  a  sheepwalker <comma> somebody  who  's  half  asleep <comma> following  instructions <comma> keeping  their  head  down <comma> fitting  in <comma> every  once  in  a  while  someone  stands  up  and  says <comma> not  me <period> someone  stands  up  and  says <comma> this  one  is  important <period> we  need  to  organize  around  it <period> and  not  everyone  will <period> but  you  do  n't  need  everyone <period> you  just  need  a  few  people <comma> who  will  look  at  the  rules <comma> realize  they  make  no  sense <comma> and  realize  how  much  they  want  to  be  connected <period> so  tony  shea  does  not  run  a  shoe  store <period> zappos  is  n't  a  shoe  store <period> zappos  is  the  one <comma> the  only <comma> the  best-there-ever-was  place  for  people  who  are  into  shoes  to  find  each  other <comma> to  talk  about  their  passion <comma> to  connect  with  people  who  care  more  about  customer  service  than  making  a  nickel  tomorrow <period> it  can  be  something  as  prosaic  as  shoes <comma> and  something  as  complicated  as  overthrowing  a  government <period> it  's  exactly  the  same  behavior  though <period> what  it  requires <comma> as  geraldine  carter  has  discovered <comma> is  to  be  able  to  say <comma> i  cannot  do  this  by  myself <period> but  if  i  can  get  other  people  to  join  my  climb  and  ride <comma> then  together  we  can  get  something  that  we  all  want <period> we  're  just  waiting  for  someone  to  lead  us <period> michelle  kaufman  has  pioneered  new  ways  of  thinking  about  environmental  architecture <period> she  does  n't  do  it  by  quietly  building  one  house  at  a  time <period> she  does  it  by  telling  a  story  to  people  who  want  to  hear  it <period> by  connecting  a  tribe  of  people  who  are  desperate  to  be  connected  to  each  other <period> by  leading  a  movement  and <period> making  change <period> and  around  and  around  and  around  it  goes <period> so  three  questions  i'd  offer  you <period> the  first  one  is <comma> who  exactly  are  you  upsetting <questionmark> because  if  you  're  not  upsetting  anyone <comma> you  're  not  changing  the  status  quo <period> the  second  question  is <comma> who  are  you  connecting <questionmark> because  for  a  lot  of  people <comma> that  's  what  they  're  in  it  for: <period> the  connections  that  are  being  made <comma> one  to  the  other <period> and  the  third  one  is <comma> who  are  you  leading <questionmark> because  focusing  on  that  part  of  it <comma> not  the  mechanics  of  what  you  're  building <comma> but  the  who <comma> and  the  leading  part <comma> is  where  change  comes <period> so  blake <comma> at  tom  's  shoes <comma> had  a  very  simple  idea <period> what  would  happen  if  every  time  someone  bought  a  pair  of  these  shoes  i  gave  exactly  the  same  pair  to  someone  who  does  n't  even  own  a  pair  of  shoes <questionmark> this  is  not  the  story  of  how  you  get  shelf  space  at  neiman  marcus <period> it  's  a  story  of  a  product  that  tells  a  story <period> and  as  you  walk  around  with  this  remarkable  pair  of  shoes  and  someone  says <comma> what  are  those <questionmark> you  get  to  tell  the  story  on  blake  's  behalf <comma> on  behalf  of  the  people  who  got  the  shoes <period> and  suddenly  it  's  not  one  pair  of  shoes  or  100  pairs  of  shoes <period> it  's  tens  of  thousands  of  pairs  of  shoes <period> my  friend  red  maxwell  has  spent  the  last  10  years  fighting  against  juvenile  diabetes <period> not  fighting  the  organization  that  's  fighting  it <comma> fighting  with  them <comma> leading  them <comma> connecting  them <comma> challenging  the  status  quo  because  it  's  important  to  him <period> and  the  people  he  surrounds  himself  with  need  the  connection <period> they  need  the  leadership <period> it  makes  a  difference <period> you  do  n't  need  permission  from  people  to  lead  them <period> but  in  case  you  do <comma> here  it  is: <period> they  're  waiting <comma> we  're  waiting  for  you  to  show  us  where  to  go  next <period> so  here  is  what  leaders  have  in  common <period> the  first  thing  is <comma> they  challenge  the  status  quo <period> they  challenge  what  's  currently  there <period> the  second  thing  is <comma> they  build  a  culture <period> a  secret  language <comma> a  seven-second  handshake <period> a  way  of  knowing  that  you  're  in  or  out <period> they  have  curiosity <period> curiosity  about  people  in  the  tribe <period> curiosity  about  outsiders <period> they  're  asking  questions <period> they  connect  people  to  one  another <period> do  you  know  what  people  want  more  than  anything <questionmark> they  want  to  be  missed <period> they  want  to  be  missed  the  day  they  do  n't  show  up <period> they  want  to  be  missed  when  they  're  gone <period> and  tribe  leaders  can  do  that <period> it  's  fascinating <comma> because  all  tribe  leaders  have  charisma <period> but  you  do  n't  need  charisma  to  become  a  leader <period> being  a  leader  gives  you  charisma <period> if  you  look  and  study  the  leaders  who  have  succeeded <comma> that  's  where  charisma  comes  from <comma> from  the  leading <period> finally <comma> they  commit <period> they  commit  to  the  cause <period> they  commit  to  the  tribe <period> they  commit  to  the  people  who  are  there <period> so  i'd  like  you  to  do  something  for  me <period> and  i  hope  you  'll  think  about  it  before  you  reject  it  out-of-hand <period> what  i  want  you  to  do <comma> it  only  takes  24  hours <comma> is <comma> create  a  movement <period> something  that  matters <period> start <period> do  it <period> we  need  it <period> thank  you  very  much <period> i  appreciate  it <period> i  told  you  three  things  last  year <period> i  told  you  that  the  statistics  of  the  world  have  not  been  made  properly  available <period> because  of  that <comma> we  still  have  the  old  mindset  of  developing  in  industrialized  countries <comma> which  is  wrong <period> and  that  animated  graphics  can  make  a  difference <period> things  are  changing <period> and  today <comma> on  the  united  nations  statistic  division  home  page <comma> it  says <comma> by  first  of  may <comma> full  access  to  the  databases <period> and  if  i  could  share  the  image  with  you  on  the  screen <period> so  three  things  have  happened <period> un <period> opened  their  statistic  databases <comma> and  we  have  a  new  version  of  the  software  up  working  as  a  beta  on  the  net <comma> so  you  do  n't  have  to  download  it  any  longer <period> and  let  me  repeat  what  you  saw  last  year <period> the  bubbles  are  the  countries <period> here  you  have  the  fertility  rate <comma> the  number  of  children  per  woman <comma> and  there  you  have  the  length  of  life  in  years <period> this  is  1950 <comma> those  were  the  industrialized  countries <comma> those  were  developing  countries <period> at  that  time  there  was  a  we  and  them <period> there  was  a  huge  difference  in  the  world <period> but  then  it  changed <comma> and  it  went  on  quite  well <period> and  this  is  what  happens <period> you  can  see  how  china  is  the  red <comma> big  bubble <period> the  blue  there  is  india <period> a  little  more  serious  this  year  in  showing  you  how  things  really  changed <period> and  it  's  africa  that  stands  out  as  the  problem  down  here <comma> does  n't  it <questionmark> large  families  still <comma> and  the  hiv  epidemic  brought  down  the  countries  like  this <period> this  is  more  or  less  what  we  saw  last  year <comma> and  this  is  how  it  will  go  on  into  the  future <period> and  i  will  talk  on <comma> is  this  possible <questionmark> because  you  see  now <comma> i  presented  statistics  that  do  n't  exist <period> because  this  is  where  we  are <period> will  it  be  possible  that  this  will  happen <questionmark> i  cover  my  lifetime  here <comma> you  know <questionmark> i  expect  to  live  100  years <period> and  this  is  where  we  are  today <period> now  could  we  look  here  instead  at  the  economic  situation  in  the  world <questionmark> and  i  would  like  to  show  that  against  child  survival <period> we  'll  swap  the  axis <period> here  you  have  child  mortality <comma> that  is <comma> survival <comma> four  kids  dying  there <comma> 200  dying  there <period> and  this  is  gdp  per  capita  on  this  axis <period> and  this  was  2007 <period> and  if  i  go  back  in  time <comma> i've  added  some  historical  statistics <comma> here  we  go <comma> here  we  go <comma> here  we  go <comma> not  so  much  statistics  100  years  ago <period> some  countries  still  had  statistics <period> we  are  looking  down  in  the  archive <comma> and  when  we  are  down  into  1820 <comma> there  is  only  austria  and  sweden  that  can  produce  numbers <period> but  they  were  down  here <period> they  had  1,000  dollars  per  person  per  year <period> and  they  lost  one-fifth  of  their  kids  before  their  first  birthday <period> so  this  is  what  happens  in  the  world <comma> if  we  play  the  entire  world <period> how  they  got  slowly  richer  and  richer <comma> and  they  add  statistics <period> is  n't  it  beautiful  when  they  get  statistics <questionmark> you  see  the  importance  of  that <questionmark> and  here <comma> children  do  n't  live  longer <period> the  last  century <comma> 1870 <comma> was  bad  for  the  kids  in  europe <comma> because  most  of  this  statistics  is  europe <period> it  was  only  by  the  turn  of  the  century  that  more  than  90  percent  of  the  children  survived  their  first  year <period> this  is  india  coming  up <comma> with  the  first  data  from  india <period> and  this  is  the  united  states  moving  away  here <comma> earning  more  money <period> and  we  will  soon  see  china  coming  up  in  the  very  far  end  corner  here <period> and  it  moves  up  with  mao  tse-tung  getting  health <comma> not  getting  so  rich <period> there  he  died <comma> then  deng  xiaoping  brings  money <period> it  moves  this  way  over  here <period> and  the  bubbles  keep  moving  up  there <comma> and  this  is  what  the  world  looks  like  today <period> let  us  have  a  look  at  the  united  states <period> we  have  a  function  here <comma> i  can  tell  the  world <comma> stay  where  you  are  and  i  take  the  united  states <comma> we  still  want  to  see  the  background <comma> i  put  them  up  like  this <comma> and  now  we  go  backwards <period> and  we  can  see  that  the  united  states  goes  to  the  right  of  the  mainstream <period> they  are  on  the  money  side  all  the  time <period> and  down  in  1915 <comma> the  united  states  was  a  neighbor  of  india <comma> present <comma> contemporary  india <period> and  that  means  united  states  was  richer <comma> but  lost  more  kids  than  india  is  doing  today <comma> proportionally <period> and  look  here <comma> compare  to  the  philippines  of  today <period> the  philippines  of  today  has  almost  the  same  economy  as  the  united  states  during  the  first  world  war <period> but  we  have  to  bring  united  states  forward  quite  a  while  to  find  the  same  health  of  the  united  states  as  we  have  in  the  philippines <period> about  1957  here <comma> the  health  of  the  united  states  is  the  same  as  the  philippines <period> and  this  is  the  drama  of  this  world  which  many  call  globalized <comma> is  that  asia <comma> arabic  countries <comma> latin  america <comma> are  much  more  ahead  in  being  healthy <comma> educated <comma> having  human  resources  than  they  are  economically <period> there  's  a  discrepancy  in  what  's  happening  today  in  the  emerging  economies <period> there  now <comma> social  benefits <comma> social  progress <comma> are  going  ahead  of  economical  progress <period> and  1957 <comma> the  united  states  had  the  same  economy  as  chile  has  today <period> and  how  long  do  we  have  to  bring  united  states  to  get  the  same  health  as  chile  has  today <questionmark> i  think  we  have  to  go <comma> there <comma> we  have  2001 <comma> or  2002 <comma> the  united  states  has  the  same  health  as  chile <period> chile  's  catching  up <period> within  some  years  chile  may  have  better  child  survival  than  the  united  states <period> this  is  really  a  change <comma> that  you  have  this  lag  of  more  or  less  30 <comma> 40  years  difference  on  the  health <period> and  behind  the  health  is  the  educational  level <period> and  there  's  a  lot  of  infrastructure  things <comma> and  general  human  resources  are  there <period> now  we  can  take  away  this <comma> and  i  would  like  to  show  you  the  rate  of  speed <comma> the  rate  of  change <comma> how  fast  they  have  gone <period> and  we  go  back  to  1920 <comma> and  i  want  to  look  at  japan <period> and  i  want  to  look  at  sweden  and  the  united  states <period> and  i  'm  going  to  stage  a  race  here  between  this  sort  of  yellowish  ford  here  and  the  red  toyota  down  there <comma> and  the  brownish  volvo <period> and  here  we  go <period> here  we  go <period> the  toyota  has  a  very  bad  start  down  here <comma> you  can  see <comma> and  the  united  states  ford  is  going  off-road  there <period> and  the  volvo  is  doing  quite  fine <period> this  is  the  war <period> the  toyota  got  off  track <comma> and  now  the  toyota  is  coming  on  the  healthier  side  of  sweden <comma> can  you  see  that <questionmark> and  they  are  taking  over  sweden <comma> and  they  are  now  healthier  than  sweden <period> that  's  the  part  where  i  sold  the  volvo  and  bought  the  toyota <period> and  now  we  can  see  that  the  rate  of  change  was  enormous  in  japan <period> they  really  caught  up <period> and  this  changes  gradually <period> we  have  to  look  over  generations  to  understand  it <period> and  let  me  show  you  my  own  sort  of  family  history <comma> we  made  these  graphs  here <period> and  this  is  the  same  thing <comma> money  down  there <comma> and  health <comma> you  know <questionmark> and  this  is  my  family <period> this  is  sweden <comma> 1830 <comma> when  my  great-great-grandma  was  born <period> sweden  was  like  sierra  leone  today <period> and  this  is  when  great-grandma  was  born <comma> 1863 <period> and  sweden  was  like  mozambique <period> and  this  is  when  my  grandma  was  born <comma> 1891 <period> she  took  care  of  me  as  a  child <comma> so  i  'm  not  talking  about  statistic  now <comma> now  it  's  oral  history  in  my  family <period> that  's  when  i  believe  statistics <comma> when  it  's  grandma-verified  statistics <period> i  think  it  's  the  best  way  of  verifying  historical  statistics <period> sweden  was  like  ghana <period> it  's  interesting  to  see  the  enormous  diversity  within  sub-saharan  africa <period> i  told  you  last  year <comma> i  'll  tell  you  again <comma> my  mother  was  born  in  egypt <comma> and  i <comma> who  am  i <questionmark> i  'm  the  mexican  in  the  family <period> and  my  daughter <comma> she  was  born  in  chile <comma> and  the  grand-daughter  was  born  in  singapore <comma> now  the  healthiest  country  on  this  earth <period> it  bypassed  sweden  about  two  to  three  years  ago <comma> with  better  child  survival <period> but  they  're  very  small <comma> you  know <questionmark> they  're  so  close  to  the  hospital  we  can  never  beat  them  out  in  these  forests <period> but  homage  to  singapore <period> singapore  is  the  best  one <period> now  this  looks  also  like  a  very  good  story <period> but  it  's  not  really  that  easy <comma> that  it  's  all  a  good  story <period> because  i  have  to  show  you  one  of  the  other  facilities <period> we  can  also  make  the  color  here  represent  the  variable <comma> and  what  am  i  choosing  here <questionmark> carbon-dioxide  emission <comma> metric  ton  per  capita <period> this  is  1962 <comma> and  united  states  was  emitting  16  tons  per  person <period> and  china  was  emitting  06 <comma> and  india  was  emitting  032  tons  per  capita <period> and  what  happens  when  we  moved  on <questionmark> well <comma> you  see  the  nice  story  of  getting  richer  and  getting  healthier  -- <period> everyone  did  it  at  the  cost  of  emission  of  carbon  dioxide <period> there  is  no  one  who  has  done  it  so  far <period> and  we  do  n't  have  all  the  updated  data  any  longer <comma> because  this  is  really  hot  data  today <period> and  there  we  are <comma> 2001 <period> and  in  the  discussion  i  attended  with  global  leaders <comma> you  know <comma> many  say  now  the  problem  is  that  the  emerging  economies <comma> they  are  getting  out  too  much  carbon  dioxide <period> the  minister  of  the  environment  of  india  said <comma> well <comma> you  were  the  one  who  caused  the  problem <period> the  oecd  countries <comma> the  high-income  countries <comma> they  were  the  ones  who  caused  the  climate  change <period> but  we  forgive  you <comma> because  you  did  n't  know  it <period> but  from  now  on <comma> we  count  per  capita <period> from  now  on  we  count  per  capita <period> and  everyone  is  responsible  for  the  per  capita  emission  this  really  shows  you <comma> we  have  not  seen  good  economic  and  health  progress  anywhere  in  the  world  without  destroying  the  climate <period> and  this  is  really  what  has  to  be  changed <period> i've  been  criticized  for  showing  you  a  too  positive  image  of  the  world <comma> but  i  do  n't  think  it  's  like  this <period> the  world  is  quite  a  messy  place <period> this  we  can  call  dollar  street <period> everyone  lives  on  this  street  here <period> what  they  earn  here <comma> what  number  they  live  on <comma> is  how  much  they  earn  per  day <period> this  family  earns  about  one  dollar  per  day <period> we  drive  up  the  street  here <comma> we  find  a  family  here  which  earns  about  two  to  three  dollars  a  day <period> and  we  drive  away  here <comma> we  find  the  first  garden  in  the  street <comma> and  they  earn  10  to  50  dollars  a  day <period> and  how  do  they  live <questionmark> if  we  look  at  the  bed  here <comma> we  can  see  that  they  sleep  on  a  rug  on  the  floor <period> this  is  what  poverty  line  is <comma> 80  percent  of  the  family  income  is  just  to  cover  the  energy  needs <comma> the  food  for  the  day <period> this  is  two  to  five  dollars <period> you  have  a  bed <period> and  here  it  's  a  much  nicer  bedroom <comma> you  can  see <period> i  lectured  on  this  for  ikea <comma> and  they  wanted  to  see  the  sofa  immediately  here <period> and  this  is  the  sofa <comma> how  it  will  emerge  from  there <period> and  the  interesting  thing <comma> when  you  go  around  here  in  the  photo  panorama <comma> you  see  the  family  still  sitting  on  the  floor  there <period> although  there  is  a  sofa <period> if  you  watch  in  the  kitchen <comma> you  can  see  that  the  great  difference  for  women  does  not  come  between  one  to  10  dollars <period> it  comes  beyond  here <comma> when  you  really  can  get  good  working  conditions  in  the  family <period> and  if  you  really  want  to  see  the  difference <comma> you  look  at  the  toilet  over  here <period> this  can  change <period> this  can  change <period> these  are  all  pictures  and  images  from  africa <comma> and  it  can  become  much  better <period> we  can  get  out  of  poverty <period> my  own  research  has  not  been  in  it  or  anything  like  this <period> i  spent  20  years  in  interviews  with  african  farmers  who  were  on  the  verge  of  famine <period> and  this  is  the  result  of  the  farmers-needs  research <period> the  nice  thing  here  is  that  you  cannot  see  who  are  the  researchers  in  this  picture <period> that  's  when  research  functions  in  poor  societies <comma> you  must  really  live  with  the  people <period> when  you  're  in  poverty <comma> everything  is  about  survival <period> it  's  about  having  food <period> and  these  two  young  farmers <comma> they  are  girls  now <comma> because  the  parents  are  dead  from  hiv  and  aids <comma> they  discuss  with  a  trained  agronomist <period> this  is  one  of  the  best  agronomists  in  malawi <comma> junatambe  kumbira <comma> and  he  's  discussing  what  sort  of  cassava  they  will  plant <comma> the  best  converter  of  sunshine  to  food  that  man  has  found <period> and  they  are  very <comma> very  eagerly  interested  to  get  advice <comma> and  that  's  to  survive  in  poverty <period> that  's  one  context <period> getting  out  of  poverty <period> the  women  told  us  one  thing <period> get  us  technology <period> we  hate  this  mortar <comma> to  stand  hours  and  hours <period> get  us  a  mill  so  that  we  can  mill  our  flour <comma> then  we  will  be  able  to  pay  for  the  rest  ourselves  technology  will  bring  you  out  of  poverty <comma> but  there  's  a  need  for  a  market  to  get  away  from  poverty <period> and  this  woman  is  very  happy  now <comma> bringing  her  products  to  the  market <period> but  she  's  very  thankful  for  the  public  investment  in  schooling  so  she  can  count <comma> and  wo  n't  be  cheated  when  she  reaches  the  market <period> she  wants  her  kid  to  be  healthy <comma> so  she  can  go  to  the  market  and  does  n't  have  to  stay  home <period> and  she  wants  the  infrastructure <comma> it  is  nice  with  a  paved  road <period> it  's  also  good  with  credit <period> micro-credits  gave  her  the  bicycle <comma> you  know <period> and  information  will  tell  her  when  to  go  to  market  with  which  product <period> you  can  do  this <period> i  find  my  experience  from  20  years  of  africa  is  that  the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible <period> africa  has  not  done  bad <period> in  50  years  they've  gone  from  a  pre-medieval  situation  to  a  very  decent  100-year-ago  europe <comma> with  a  functioning  nation  and  state <period> i  would  say  that  sub-saharan  africa  has  done  best  in  the  world  during  the  last  50  years <period> because  we  do  n't  consider  where  they  came  from <period> it  's  this  stupid  concept  of  developing  countries  that  puts  us <comma> argentina  and  mozambique  together  50  years  ago <comma> and  says  that  mozambique  did  worse <period> we  have  to  know  a  little  more  about  the  world <period> i  have  a  neighbor  who  knows  200  types  of  wine <period> he  knows  everything <period> he  knows  the  name  of  the  grape <comma> the  temperature  and  everything <period> i  only  know  two  types  of  wine <comma> red  and  white <period> but  my  neighbor  only  knows  two  types  of  countries <comma> industrialized  and  developing <period> and  i  know  200 <comma> i  know  about  the  small  data <period> but  you  can  do  that <period> but  i  have  to  get  serious <period> and  how  do  you  get  serious <questionmark> you  make  a  powerpoint <comma> you  know <questionmark> homage  to  the  office  package <comma> no <questionmark> what  is  this <comma> what  is  this <comma> what  am  i  telling <questionmark> i  'm  telling  you  that  there  are  many  dimensions  of  development <period> everyone  wants  your  pet  thing <period> if  you  are  in  the  corporate  sector <comma> you  love  micro-credit <period> if  you  are  fighting  in  a  non-governmental  organization <comma> you  love  equity  between  gender <period> or  if  you  are  a  teacher <comma> you  'll  love  unesco <comma> and  so  on <period> on  the  global  level <comma> we  have  to  have  more  than  our  own  thing <period> we  need  everything <period> all  these  things  are  important  for  development <comma> especially  when  you  just  get  out  of  poverty  and  you  should  go  towards  welfare <period> now <comma> what  we  need  to  think  about  is <comma> what  is  a  goal  for  development <comma> and  what  are  the  means  for  development <questionmark> let  me  first  grade  what  are  the  most  important  means <period> economic  growth  to  me <comma> as  a  public-health  professor <comma> is  the  most  important  thing  for  development  because  it  explains  80  percent  of  survival <period> governance <period> to  have  a  government  which  functions <comma> that  's  what  brought  california  out  of  the  misery  of  1850 <period> it  was  the  government  that  made  law  function  finally <period> education <comma> human  resources  are  important <period> health  is  also  important <comma> but  not  that  much  as  a  mean <period> environment  is  important <period> human  rights  is  also  important <comma> but  it  just  gets  one  cross <period> now  what  about  goals <questionmark> where  are  we  going  toward <questionmark> we  are  not  interested  in  money <period> money  is  not  a  goal <period> it  's  the  best  mean <comma> but  i  give  it  zero  as  a  goal <period> governance <comma> well  it  's  fun  to  vote  in  a  little  thing <comma> but  it  's  not  a  goal <period> and  going  to  school <comma> that  's  not  a  goal <comma> it  's  a  mean <period> health  i  give  two  points <period> i  mean  it  's  nice  to  be  healthy <comma> at  my  age  especially <comma> you  can  stand  here <comma> you  're  healthy <period> and  that  's  good <comma> it  gets  two  plusses <period> environment  is  very <comma> very  crucial <period> there  's  nothing  for  the  grandkid  if  you  do  n't  save  up <period> but  where  are  the  important  goals <questionmark> of  course <comma> it  's  human  rights <period> human  rights  is  the  goal <comma> but  it  's  not  that  strong  of  a  mean  for  achieving  development <period> and  culture <period> culture  is  the  most  important  thing <comma> i  would  say <comma> because  that  's  what  brings  joy  to  life <period> that  's  the  value  of  living <period> so  the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible <period> even  african  countries  can  achieve  this <period> and  i've  shown  you  the  shot  where  the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible <period> and  remember <comma> please  remember  my  main  message <comma> which  is  this <comma> the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible <period> we  can  have  a  good  world <period> i  showed  you  the  shots <comma> i  proved  it  in  the  powerpoint <comma> and  i  think  i  will  convince  you  also  by  culture <period> bring  me  my  sword <period> sword  swallowing  is  from  ancient  india <period> it  's  a  cultural  expression  that  for  thousands  of  years  has  inspired  human  beings  to  think  beyond  the  obvious <period> and  i  will  now  prove  to  you  that  the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible  by  taking  this  piece  of  steel <comma> solid  steel <comma> this  is  the  army  bayonet  from  the  swedish  army <comma> 1850 <comma> in  the  last  year  we  had  war <period> and  it  's  all  solid  steel <comma> you  can  hear  here <period> and  i  'm  going  to  take  this  blade  of  steel <comma> and  push  it  down  through  my  body  of  blood  and  flesh <comma> and  prove  to  you  that  the  seemingly  impossible  is  possible <period> can  i  request  a  moment  of  absolute  silence <questionmark> i  get  asked  a  lot  what  the  difference  between  my  work  is  and  typical  pentagon  long-range  strategic  planners <period> and  the  answer  i  like  to  offer  is  what  they  typically  do  is  they  think  about  the  future  of  wars  in  the  context  of  war <period> and  what  i've  spent  15  years  doing  in  this  business <comma> and  it  's  taken  me  almost  14  to  figure  it  out <comma> is  i  think  about  the  future  of  wars  in  the  context  of  everything  else <period> so  i  tend  to  specialize  on  the  scene  between  war  and  peace <period> the  material  i  'm  going  to  show  you  is  one  idea  from  a  book <period> with  a  lot  of  ideas <period> it  's  the  one  that  takes  me  around  the  world  right  now  interacting  with  foreign  militaries  quite  a  bit <period> the  material  was  generated  in  two  years  of  work  i  did  for  the  secretary  of  defense <comma> thinking  about  a  new  national  grand  strategy  for  the  united  states <period> i  'm  going  to  present  a  problem  and  try  to  give  you  an  answer <period> here  's  my  favorite  bonehead  concept  from  the  1990s  in  the  pentagon <comma> the  theory  of  anti-access <comma> area-denial  asymmetrical  strategies <period> why  do  we  call  it  that <questionmark> because  it  's  got  all  those  a  's  lined  up  i  guess <period> this  is  gobbledygook  for  if  the  united  states  fights  somebody  we  're  going  to  be  huge <period> they  're  going  to  be  small <period> and  if  they  try  to  fight  us  in  the  traditional <comma> straight-up  manner  we  're  going  to  kick  their  ass <comma> which  is  why  people  do  n't  try  to  do  that  any  more <period> i  met  the  last  air  force  general  who  had  actually  shot  down  an  enemy  plane  in  combat <period> he  's  now  a  one  star  general <period> that  's  how  distant  we  are  from  even  meeting  an  air  force  willing  to  fly  against  ours <period> so  that  overmatched  capability  creates  problems <comma> catastrophic  successes  the  white  house  calls  them <period> and  we  're  trying  to  figure  that  out <comma> because  it  is  an  amazing  capability <period> the  question  is <comma> what  's  the  good  you  can  do  with  it <questionmark> ok <questionmark> the  theory  of  anti-access <comma> area-denial  asymmetrical  strategies <comma> gobbledygook  that  we  sell  to  congress <comma> because  if  we  just  told  them  we  can  kick  anybody  's  asses  they  would  n't  buy  us  all  the  stuff  we  want <period> so  we  say <comma> area-denial <comma> anti-access  asymmetrical  strategies  and  their  eyes  glaze  over <period> and  they  say <comma> will  you  build  it  in  my  district <questionmark> here  's  my  parody  and  it  ai  n't  much  of  one <period> let  's  talk  about  a  battle  space <period> i  do  n't  know <comma> taiwan  straits  2025 <period> let  's  talk  about  an  enemy  embedded  within  that  battle  space <period> i  do  n't  know <comma> the  million  man  swim <period> the  united  states  has  to  access  that  battle  space  instantaneously <period> they  throw  up  anti-access <comma> area-denial  asymmetrical  strategies <period> a  banana  peel  on  the  tarmac <period> trojan  horses  on  our  computer  networks  reveal  all  our  achilles  heels  instantly <period> we  say <comma> china <comma> it  's  yours <period> prometheus  approach <comma> largely  a  geographic  definition <comma> focuses  almost  exclusively  on  the  start  of  conflict <period> we  field  the  first-half  team  in  a  league  that  insists  on  keeping  score  until  the  end  of  the  game <period> that  's  the  problem <period> we  can  run  the  score  up  against  anybody <comma> and  then  get  our  asses  kicked  in  the  second  half <comma> what  they  call  fourth  generation  warfare <period> here  's  the  way  i  like  to  describe  it  instead <period> there  is  no  battle  space  the  us <period> military  cannot  access <period> they  said  we  could  n't  do  afghanistan <period> we  did  it  with  ease <period> they  said  we  could  n't  do  iraq <period> we  did  it  with  150  combat  casualties  in  six  weeks <period> we  did  it  so  fast  we  were  n't  prepared  for  their  collapse <period> there  is  nobody  we  cannot  take  down <period> the  question  is <comma> what  do  you  do  with  the  power <questionmark> so  there  's  no  trouble  accessing  battle  spaces <period> what  we  have  trouble  accessing  is  the  transition  space  that  must  naturally  follow <comma> and  creating  the  peace  space  that  allows  us  to  move  on <period> problem  is <comma> the  defense  department  over  here  beats  the  hell  out  of  you <period> the  state  department  over  here  says <comma> come  on  boy <comma> i  know  you  can  make  it  and  that  poor  country  runs  off  that  ledge <comma> does  that  cartoon  thing  and  then  drops <period> this  is  not  about  overwhelming  force <comma> but  proportional  force <period> it  's  about  non-lethal  technologies <comma> because  if  you  fire  real  ammo  into  a  crowd  of  women  and  children  rioting  you  're  going  to  lose  friends  very  quickly <period> this  is  not  about  projecting  power <comma> but  about  staying  power <comma> which  is  about  legitimacy  with  the  locals <period> who  do  you  access  in  this  transition  space <questionmark> you  have  to  create  internal  partners <period> you  have  to  access  coalition  partners <period> we  asked  the  indians  for  17,000  peace  keepers <period> i  know  their  senior  leadership <comma> they  wanted  to  give  it  to  us <period> but  they  said  to  us <comma> you  know  what <questionmark> in  that  transition  space  you  're  mostly  hat  not  enough  cattle <period> we  do  n't  think  you  can  pull  it  off <comma> we  're  not  going  to  give  you  our  17,000  peace  keepers  for  fodder <period> we  asked  the  russians  for  40,000 <period> they  said  no <period> i  was  in  china  in  august <comma> i  said <comma> you  should  have  50,000  peace  keepers  in  iraq <period> it  's  your  oil <comma> not  ours  which  is  the  truth <period> it  's  their  oil <period> and  the  chinese  said  to  me <comma> dr.  barnett <comma> you  're  absolutely  right <period> in  a  perfect  world  we'd  have  50,000  there <period> but  it  's  not  a  perfect  world <comma> and  your  administration  is  n't  getting  us  any  closer  but  we  have  trouble  accessing  our  outcomes <period> we  lucked  out <comma> frankly <comma> on  the  selection <period> we  face  different  opponents  across  these  three <period> and  it  's  time  to  start  admitting  you  cannot  ask  the  same  19-year-old  to  do  it  all <comma> day  in  and  day  out <period> it  's  just  too  damn  hard <period> we  have  an  unparalleled  capacity  to  wage  war <period> we  do  n't  do  the  everything  else  so  well <period> frankly <comma> we  do  it  better  than  anybody  and  we  still  suck  at  it <period> we  have  a  brilliant  secretary  of  war <period> we  do  n't  have  a  secretary  of  everything  else <period> because  if  we  did <comma> that  guy  would  be  in  front  of  the  senate <comma> still  testifying  over  abu  ghraib <period> the  problem  is  he  does  n't  exist <period> there  is  no  secretary  of  everything  else <period> i  think  we  have  an  unparalleled  capacity  to  wage  war <period> i  call  that  the  leviathan  force <period> what  we  need  to  build  is  a  force  for  the  everything  else <period> i  call  them  the  system  administrators <period> what  i  think  this  really  represents  is  lack  of  an  a  to  z  rule  set  for  the  world  as  a  whole  for  processing  politically  bankrupt  states <period> we  have  one  for  processing  economically  bankrupt  states <period> it  's  the  imf  sovereign  bankruptcy  plan <comma> ok <questionmark> we  argue  about  it  every  time  we  use  it <period> argentina  just  went  through  it <comma> broke  a  lot  of  rules <period> they  got  out  on  the  far  end <comma> we  said <comma> fine <comma> do  n't  worry  about  it <period> it  's  transparent <period> a  certain  amount

and  those  who  see  a  future  that  starts  to  scare  them <period> like  the  us <period> submarine  community <comma> which  watches  the  soviet  navy  disappear  overnight <period> ah <period> so  they  start  moving  from  reality  towards  desire  and  they  create  their  own  special  language  to  describe  their  voyage  of  self-discovery  and  self-actualization <period> the  problem  is  you  need  a  big <comma> sexy  opponent  to  fight  against <period> and  if  you  cannot  find  one  you've  got  to  make  one  up <period> china <comma> all  grown  up <comma> going  to  be  a  looker <period> the  rest  of  the  military  got  dragged  down  into  the  muck  across  the  1990s <period> and  they  developed  this  very  derisive  term  to  describe  it <comma> military  operations  other  than  war <period> i  ask  you <comma> who  joins  the  military  to  do  things  other  than  war <questionmark> actually <comma> most  of  them <period> jessica  lynch

they  spent  the  1990s  working  the  messy  scene  between  globalized  parts  of  the  world <period> what  i  call  the  core  and  the  gap <period> the  clinton  administration  was  n't  interested  in  running  this <period> for  eight  years <comma> after  screwing  up  the  relationship  on  day  one <comma> inauguration  day  with  gays  in  the  military <comma> which  was  deft <period> so  we  were  home  alone  for  eight  years <period> and  what  did  we  do  home  alone <questionmark> we  bought  one  military  and  we  operated  another <period> it  's  like  the  guy

<period> bad  pentagon <comma> bad  and  they'd  say <comma> dr.  barnett <comma> you  are  so  right <period> can  you  come  back  next  year  and  remind  us  again  some  people  say  9/11  heals  the  rift <comma> jerks  the  long-term  transformation  gurus  out  of  their  30,000  foot  view  of  history <comma> drags  them  down  in  to  the  muck  and  says <comma> you  want  a  networked

<comma> because  that  's  how  you  're  going  to  shrink  that  gap <period> some  people  put  these  two  things  together  and  they  call  it  empire <comma> which  i  think  is  a  boneheaded  concept <period> empire  is  about  the  enforcement  of  not  just  minimal  rule  sets <comma> which  you  cannot  do <comma> but  maximum  rule  sets  which  you  must  do <period> it  's  not  our

<period> they  can  kill  three  million  in  chicago  tomorrow  and  we  do  n't  go  to  the  mattresses  with  nukes <period> that  's  the  scary  part <period> the  question  is  how  do  we  reconnect  american  national  security  with  global  security  to  make  the  world  a  lot  more  comfortable <comma> and  to  embed  and  contextualize  our  employment  of  force  around  the

<comma> staring  at  the  sky  and  the  sun  and  the  moon <period> alexander  asked <comma> what  are  you  doing  and  the  gymnosophist  answered <comma> i  'm  experiencing  nothingness  then  the  gymnosophist  asked <comma> what  are  you  doing  and  alexander  said <comma> i  am  conquering  the  world  and  they  both  laughed <period> each  one  thought  that  the  other  was  a  fool <period> the  gymnosophist  said <comma> why  is  he  conquering  the  world <questionmark> it  's  pointless  and  alexander  thought <comma> why  is  he  sitting  around <comma> doing  nothing <questionmark> what  a  waste  of  a  life  to  understand  this  difference  in  viewpoints <comma> we  have  to  understand  the  subjective  truth  of  alexander <comma> his  myth <comma> and  the  mythology  that  constructed  it <period> alexander  's  mother <comma> his  parents <comma> his  teacher  aristotle  told  him  the  story  of  homer  's  iliad <period> they  told  him  of  a  great  hero  called  achilles <comma> who <comma> when  he  participated  in  battle <comma> victory  was  assured <comma> but  when  he  withdrew  from  the  battle <comma> defeat  was  inevitable <period> achilles  was  a  man  who  could  shape  history <comma> a  man  of  destiny <comma> and  this  is  what  you  should  be <comma> alexander  that  's  what  he  heard <period> what  should  you  not  be <questionmark> you  should  not  be  sisyphus <comma> who  rolls  a  rock  up  a  mountain  all  day  only  to  find  the  boulder  rolled  down  at  night <period> do  n't  live  a  life  which  is  monotonous <comma> mediocre <comma> meaningless <period> be  spectacular <comma> like  the  greek  heroes <comma> like  jason <comma> who  went  across  the  sea  with  the  argonauts  and  fetched  the  golden  fleece <period> be  spectacular  like  theseus <comma> who  entered  the  labyrinth  and  killed  the  bull-headed  minotaur <period> when  you  play  in  a  race <comma> win <comma> because  when  you  win <comma> the  exhilaration  of  victory  is  the  closest  you  will  come  to  the  ambrosia  of  the  gods  because <comma> you  see <comma> the  greeks  believed  you  live  only  once <comma> and  when  you  die <comma> you  have  to  cross  the  river  styx <period> and  if  you  have  lived  an  extraordinary  life <comma> you  will  be  welcomed  to  elysium <comma> or  what  the  french  call  champs-élysées <comma> the  heaven  of  the  heroes <period> but  these  are  not  the  stories  that  the  gymnosophist  heard <period> he  heard  a  very  different  story <period> he  heard  of  a  man  called  bharat <comma> after  whom  india  is  called  bhārata <period> bharat  also  conquered  the  world <period> and  then  he  went  to  the  top-most  peak  of  the  greatest  mountain  of  the  center  of  the  world  called  meru <period> and  he  wanted  to  hoist  his  flag  to  say <comma> i  was  here  first  but  when  he  reached  the  mountain  peak <comma> he  found  the  peak  covered  with  countless  flags  of  world-conquerors  before  him <comma> each  one  claiming  i  was  here  first <period> that  's  what  i  thought  until  i  came  here  and  suddenly <comma> in  this  canvas  of  infinity <comma> bharat  felt  insignificant <period> this  was  the  mythology  of  the  gymnosophist <period> you  see <comma> he  had  heroes <comma> like  ram <comma> raghupati  ram  and  krishna <comma> govinda  hari <period> but  they  were  not  two  characters  on  two  different  adventures <period> they  were  two  lifetimes  of  the  same  hero <period> when  the  ramayana  ends  the  mahabharata  begins <period> when  ram  dies <comma> krishna  is  born <period> when  krishna  dies <comma> eventually  he  will  be  back  as  ram <period> you  see <comma> the  indians  also  had  a  river  that  separates  the  land  of  the  living  from  the  land  of  the  dead <period> but  you  do  n't  cross  it  once <period> you  go  to  and  fro  endlessly <period> it  was  called  the  vaitarani <period> you  go  again  and  again  and  again <period> because <comma> you  see <comma> nothing  lasts  forever  in  india <comma> not  even  death <period> and  so <comma> you  have  these  grand  rituals  where  great  images  of  mother  goddesses  are  built  and  worshiped  for  10  days <period> and  what  do  you  do  at  the  end  of  10  days <questionmark> you  dunk  it  in  the  river <period> because  it  has  to  end <period> and  next  year <comma> she  will  come  back <period> what  goes  around  always  comes  around <comma> and  this  rule  applies  not  just  to  man <comma> but  also  the  gods <period> you  see <comma> the  gods  have  to  come  back  again  and  again  and  again  as  ram <comma> as  krishna <period> not  only  do  they  live  infinite  lives <comma> but  the  same  life  is  lived  infinite  times  till  you  get  to  the  point  of  it  all <period> groundhog  day <period> two  different  mythologies <period> which  is  right <questionmark> two  different  mythologies <comma> two  different  ways  of  looking  at  the  world <period> one  linear <comma> one  cyclical <period> one  believes  this  is  the  one  and  only  life <period> the  other  believes  this  is  one  of  many  lives <period> and  so <comma> the  denominator  of  alexander  's  life  was  one <period> so <comma> the  value  of  his  life  was  the  sum  total  of  his  achievements <period> the  denominator  of  the  gymnosophist  's  life  was  infinity <period> so <comma> no  matter  what  he  did <comma> it  was  always  zero <period> and  i  believe  it  is  this  mythological  paradigm  that  inspired  indian  mathematicians  to  discover  the  number  zero <period> who  knows <questionmark> and  that  brings  us  to  the  mythology  of  business <period> if  alexander  's  belief  influenced  his  behavior <comma> if  the  gymnosophist  's  belief  influences  his  behavior <comma> then  it  was  bound  to  influence  the  business  they  were  in <period> you  see <comma> what  is  business  but  the  result  of  how  the  market  behaves  and  how  the  organization  behaves <questionmark> and  if  you  look  at  cultures  around  the  world <comma> all  you  have  to  do  is  understand  the  mythology  and  you  will  see  how  they  behave  and  how  they  do  business <period> take  a  look <period> if  you  live  only  once <comma> in  one-life  cultures  around  the  world <comma> you  will  see  an  obsession  with  binary  logic <comma> absolute  truth <comma> standardization <comma> absoluteness <comma> linear  patterns  in  design <period> but  if  you  look  at  cultures  which  have  cyclical  and  based  on  infinite  lives <comma> you  will  see  a  comfort  with  fuzzy  logic <comma> with  opinion <comma> with  contextual  thinking <comma> with  everything  is  relative <comma> sort  of <comma> mostly <period> you  look  at  art <period> look  at  the  ballerina <period> how  linear  she  is  in  her  performance <period> and  then  look  at  the  indian  classical  dancer <comma> the  kuchipudi  dancer <comma> the  bharatanatyam  dancer <comma> curvaceous <period> and  then  look  at  business <period> standard  business  model <comma> vision <comma> mission <comma> values <comma> processes <period> sounds  very  much  like  the  journey  through  the  wilderness  to  the  promised  land <comma> with  the  commandments  held  by  the  leader <period> and  if  you  comply <comma> you  will  go  to  heaven <period> but  in  india  there  is  no  the  promised  land <period> there  are  many  promised  lands <comma> depending  on  your  station  in  society <comma> depending  on  your  stage  of  life <period> you  see <comma> businesses  are  not  run  as  institutions <comma> by  the  idiosyncrasies  of  individuals <period> it  's  always  about  taste <period> it  's  always  about  my  taste <period> you  see <comma> indian  music <comma> for  example <comma> does  not  have  the  concept  of  harmony <period> there  is  no  orchestra  conductor <period> there  is  one  performer  standing  there <comma> and  everybody  follows <period> and  you  can  never  replicate  that  performance  twice <period> it  is  not  about  documentation  and  contract <period> it  's  about  conversation  and  faith <period> it  's  not  about  compliance <period> it  's  about  setting <comma> getting  the  job  done <comma> by  bending  or  breaking  the  rules <comma> just  look  at  your  indian  people  around  here <comma> you  'll  see  them  smile <period> they  know  what  it  is <period> and  then  look  at  people  who  have  done  business  in  india <comma> you  'll  see  the  exasperation  on  their  faces <period> you  see <comma> this  is  what  india  is  today <period> the  ground  reality  is  based  on  a  cyclical  world  view <period> so <comma> it  's  rapidly  changing <comma> highly  diverse <comma> chaotic <comma> ambiguous <comma> unpredictable <period> and  people  are  okay  with  it <period> and  then  globalization  is  taking  place <period> the  demands  of  modern  institutional  thinking  is  coming  in <period> which  is  rooted  in  one-life  culture <period> and  a  clash  is  going  to  take  place <comma> like  on  the  banks  of  the  indus <period> it  is  bound  to  happen <period> i  have  personally  experienced  it <period> i  'm  trained  as  a  medical  doctor <period> i  did  not  want  to  study  surgery <period> do  n't  ask  me  why <period> i  love  mythology  too  much <period> i  wanted  to  learn  mythology <period> but  there  is  nowhere  you  can  study <period> so <comma> i  had  to  teach  it  to  myself <period> and  mythology  does  not  pay <comma> well <comma> until  now <period> so <comma> i  had  to  take  up  a  job <period> and  i  worked  in  the  pharma  industry <period> and  i  worked  in  the  healthcare  industry <period> and  i  worked  as  a  marketing  guy <comma> and  a  sales  guy <comma> and  a  knowledge  guy <comma> and  a  content  guy <comma> and  a  training  guy <period> i  even  was  a  business  consultant <comma> doing  strategies  and  tactics <period> and  i  would  see  the  exasperation  between  my  american  and  european  colleagues <comma> when  they  were  dealing  with  india <period> example <comma> please  tell  us  the  process  to  invoice  hospitals <period> step  a <period> step  b <period> step  c <period> mostly <period> how  do  you  parameterize  mostly <questionmark> how  do  you  put  it  in  a  nice  little  software <questionmark> you  cannot <period> i  would  give  my  viewpoints  to  people <period> but  nobody  was  interested  in  listening  to  it <comma> you  see <comma> until  i  met  kishore  biyani  of  the  future  group <period> you  see <comma> he  has  established  the  largest  retail  chain <comma> called  big  bazaar <period> and  there  are  more  than  200  formats <comma> across  50  cities  and  towns  of  india <period> and  he  was  dealing  with  diverse  and  dynamic  markets <period> and  he  knew  very  intuitively <comma> that  best  practices <comma> developed  in  japan  and  china  and  europe  and  america  will  not  work  in  india <period> he  knew  that  institutional  thinking  does  n't  work  in  india <period> individual  thinking  does <period> he  had  an  intuitive  understanding  of  the  mythic  structure  of  india <period> so <comma> he  had  asked  me  to  be  the  chief  belief  officer <comma> and  said <comma> all  i  want  to  do  is  align  belief  sounds  so  simple <period> but  belief  is  not  measurable <period> you  cannot  measure  it <period> you  cannot  manage  it <period> so <comma> how  do  you  construct  belief <questionmark> how  do  you  enhance  the  sensitivity  of  people  to  indian-ness <period> even  if  you  are  indian <comma> it  is  not  very  explicit <comma> it  is  not  very  obvious <period> so <comma> i  tried  to  work  on  the  standard  model  of  culture <comma> which  is <comma> develop  stories <comma> symbols  and  rituals <period> and  i  will  share  one  of  the  rituals  with  you <period> you  see  it  is  based  on  the  hindu  ritual  of  darshan <period> hindus  do  n't  have  the  concept  of  commandments <period> so <comma> there  is  nothing  right  or  wrong  in  what  you  do  in  life <period> so <comma> you  're  not  really  sure  how  you  stand  in  front  of  god <period> so <comma> when  you  go  to  the  temple <comma> all  you  seek  is  an  audience  with  god <period> you  want  to  see  god <period> and  you  want  god  to  see  you <comma> and  hence  the  gods  have  very  large  eyes <comma> large  unblinking  eyes <comma> sometimes  made  of  silver <comma> so  they  look  at  you <period> because  you  do  n't  know  whether  you  're  right  or  wrong <comma> and  so  all  you  seek  is  divine  empathy <period> just  know  where  i  came  from <comma> why  i  did  the  jugaad  why  did  i  do  the  setting <comma> why  i  do  n't  care  for  the  processes <period> just  understand  me <comma> please  and  based  on  this <comma> we  created  a  ritual  for  leaders <period> after  a  leader  completes  his  training  and  is  about  to  take  over  the  store <comma> we  blindfold  him <comma> we  surround  him  with  the  stakeholders <comma> the  customer <comma> his  family <comma> his  team <comma> his  boss <period> you  read  out  his  kra <comma> his  kpi <comma> you  give  him  the  keys <comma> and  then  you  remove  the  blindfold <period> and  invariably <comma> you  see  a  tear <comma> because  the  penny  has  dropped <period> he  realizes  that  to  succeed <comma> he  does  not  have  to  be  a  professional <comma> he  does  not  have  to  cut  out  his  emotions <comma> he  has  to  include  all  these  people  in  his  world  to  succeed <comma> to  make  them  happy <comma> to  make  the  boss  happy <comma> to  make  everyone  happy <period> the  customer  is  happy <comma> because  the  customer  is  god <period> that  sensitivity  is  what  we  need <period> once  this  belief  enters <comma> behavior  will  happen <comma> business  will  happen <period> and  it  has <period> so <comma> then  we  come  back  to  alexander  and  to  the  gymnosophist <period> and  everybody  asks  me <comma> which  is  the  better  way <comma> this  way  or  that  way  and  it  's  a  very  dangerous  question <period> because  it  leads  you  to  the  path  of  fundamentalism  and  violence <period> so <comma> i  will  not  answer  the  question <period> what  i  will  give  you  is  an  indian  answer <comma> the  indian  head-shake <period> depending  on  the  context <comma> depending  on  the  outcome <comma> choose  your  paradigm <period> you  see <comma> because  both  the  paradigms  are  human  constructions <period> they  are  cultural  creations <comma> not  natural  phenomena <period> and  so  the  next  time  you  meet  someone <comma> a  stranger <comma> one  request <comma> understand  that  you  live  in  the  subjective  truth <comma> and  so  does  he <period> understand  it <period> and  when  you  understand  it  you  will  discover  something  spectacular <period> you  will  discover  that  within  infinite  myths  lies  the  eternal  truth <period> who  sees  it  all <questionmark> varuna  has  but  a  thousand  eyes <period> indra <comma> a  hundred <period> you  and  i <comma> only  two <period> thank  you <period> namaste <period> my  age  is  three  hundred  and  seventy-two  i  think  with  the  deepest  regret  how  i  used  to  pick  up  and  voraciously  chew  the  dear  little  boys  that  i  met  i've  eaten  them  raw  in  their  holiday  suits <comma> eaten  them  curried  with  rice <comma> i've  eaten  them  baked  in  their  jackets  and  boots <comma> and  found  them  exceedingly  nice <period> but  now  that  my  jaws  are  too  weak  for  such  fare <comma> i  think  it  's  increasingly  rude  to  do  such  a  thing  when  i  'm  quite  well  aware  little  boys  do  not  like  being  chewed <period> little  boys  do  not  like  being  chewed <period> so  now  i  contentedly  live  upon  eels <comma> and  try  to  do  nothing  amiss  and  pass  all  the  time  i  can  spare  from  my  meals  in  innocent  slumber  like  this <comma> innocent  slumber  like  this <period> i  suppose  i  owe  you  an  explanation <period> i've  been  working  on  a  project  for  the  last  six  years  adapting  children  's  poetry  to  music <period> and  that  's  a  poem  by  charles  edward  carryl <comma> who  was  a  stockbroker  in  new  york  city  for  45  years <comma> but  in  the  evenings <comma> he  wrote  nonsense  for  his  children <period> and  this  book  was  one  of  the  most  famous  books  in  america  for  about  35  years <period> the  sleepy  giant <comma> which  is  the  song  that  i  just  sang <comma> is  one  of  his  poems <period> now <comma> we  're  going  to  do  other  poems  for  you <period> and  here  's  a  preview  of  some  of  the  poets <period> this  is  rachel  field <comma> robert  graves <comma> a  very  young  robert  graves <comma> christina  rossetti <period> ghosts <comma> right <questionmark> have  nothing  to  say  to  us <period> obsolete <period> gone  -- <period> not  so <period> what  i  really  enjoyed  about  this  project  is  reviving  these  people  's  words <period> taking  them  off  the  dead <comma> flat  pages <period> bringing  them  to  life <comma> bringing  them  to  light <period> so <comma> what  we  're  going  to  do  next  is  a  poem  that  was  written  by  nathalia  crane <period> nathalia  crane  was  a  little  girl  from  brooklyn <period> when  she  was  10  years  old  in  1927 <comma> she  published  her  first  book  of  poems  called  the  janitor  's  boy <period> here  she  is <period> and  here  's  her  poem <period> oh <comma> i  'm  in  love  with  the  janitor  's  boy <comma> and  the  janitor  's  boy  is  in  love  with  me <period> oh <comma> i  'm  in  love  with  the  janitor  's  boy <comma> and  the  janitor  's  boy  is  in  love  with  me <period> he  's  going  to  hunt  for  a  desert  isle  in  our  geography <period> a  desert  isle  with  spicy  trees  somewhere  in  sheepshead  bay <period> a  right  nice  place

down  in  the  cellar  he  's  making  a  raft  out  of  an  old  settee <period> he  'll  carry  me  off <comma> i  know  that  he  will <comma> for  his  hair  is  exceedingly  red <period> and  the  only  thing  that  occurs  to  me  is  to  dutifully  shiver  in  bed <period> and  on  the  day  that  we  sail <comma> i  will  leave  a  little  note  for  my  parents  i  hate  to  annoy <comma>

always  ourselves  that  we  find  at  the  sea  thank  you <period> the  next  poem  is  if  no  one  ever  marries  me <period> it  was  written  by  laurence  alma-tadema <period> she  was  the  daughter  of  a  very <comma> very  famous  dutch  painter  who  had  made  his  fame  in  england <period> he  went  there  after  the  death  of  his  wife  of  smallpox  and  brought  his  two  young  children <period> one  was  his  daughter <comma> laurence <period> she  wrote  this  poem  when  she  was  18  years  old  in  1888 <comma> and  i  look  at  it  as  kind  of  a  very  sweet  feminist  manifesto  tinged  with  a  little  bit  of  defiance  and  a  little  bit  of  resignation  and  regret <period> well <comma> if  no  one  ever  marries  me  and  i  do  n't  see  why  they  should <comma> nurse  says  i  'm  not  pretty <comma> and  you  know  i  'm  seldom  good <comma> seldom  good <comma> well <comma> if  no  one  ever  marries  me  i  sha  n't  mind  very  much

became  very  curious  about  the  poets  after  spending  six  years  with  them <comma> and  started  to  research  their  lives <comma> and  then  decided  to  write  a  book  about  it <period> and  the  burning  question  about  alma-tadema  was <comma> did  she  marry <questionmark> and  the  answer  was  no <comma> which  i  found  in  the  london  times  archive <period> she  died  alone  in  1940  in  the  company  of  her  books  and  her  dear  friends <period> gerard  manley  hopkins <comma> a  saintly  man <period> he  became  a  jesuit <period> he  converted  from  his  anglican  faith <period> he  was  moved  to  by  the  tractarian  movement <comma> the  oxford  movement <comma> otherwise  known  as <comma> and  he  became  a  jesuit  priest <period> he  burned  all  his  poetry  at  the  age  of  24  and  then  did  not  write  another  poem  for  at  least  seven  years  because  he  could  n't  rectify  the  life  of  a  poet  with  the  life  of  a  priest <period> he  died  typhoid  fever  at  the  age  of  44 <comma> i  believe <comma> 43  or  44 <period> at  the  time <comma> he  was  teaching  classics  at  trinity  college  in  dublin <period> a  few  years  before  he  died <comma> after  he  had  resumed  writing  poetry <comma> but  in  secret <comma> he  confessed  to  a  friend  in  a  letter  that  i  found  when  i  was  doing  my  research <comma> i've  written  a  verse <period> it  is  to  explain  death  to  a  child <period> and  it  deserves  a  piece  of  plain-song  music <period> and  my  blood  froze  when  i  read  that  because  i  had  written  the  plain-song  music  130  years  after  he'd  written  the  letter <period> and  the  poem  is  called <comma> spring  and  fall <period> margaret <comma> are  you  grieving  over  goldengrove  unleaving <comma> by  and  by <questionmark> leaves <comma> like  the  things  of  man <comma> you  with  your  fresh  thoughts  care  for <comma> can  you <questionmark>

decrescendo <period> gradually <comma> bringing  it  down <comma> bringing  it  down <period> i  want  to  thank  you <comma> thank  you  finger  popping <comma> ai  n't  no  stopping <period> thank  you  so  much <period> i've  been  working  on  issues  of  poverty  for  more  than  20  years <comma> and  so  it  's  ironic  that  the  problem  that  and  question  that  i  most  grapple  with  is  how  you  actually  define  poverty <period> what  does  it  mean <questionmark> so  often <comma> we  look  at  dollar  terms <comma> people  making  less  than  a  dollar  or  two  or  three  a  day <period> and  yet  the  complexity  of  poverty  really  has  to  look  at  income  as  only  one  variable <period> because  really <comma> it  's  a  condition  about  choice <period> and  the  lack  of  freedom <period> and  i  had  an  experience  that  really  deepened  and  elucidated  for  me  the  understanding  that  i  have <period> it  was  in  kenya <comma> and  i  want  to  share  it  with  you <period> i  was  with  my  friend  susan  meiselas <comma> the  photographer <comma> in  the  mathare  valley  slums <period> now <comma> mathare  valley  is  one  of  the  oldest  slums  in  africa <period> it  's  about  three  miles  out  of  nairobi <comma> and  it  's  a  mile  long  and  about  two-tenths  of  a  mile  wide <comma> where  over  half  a  million  people  live  crammed  in  these  little  tin  shacks <comma> generation  after  generation <comma> renting  them <comma> often  eight  or  10  people  to  a  room <period> and  it  's  known  for  prostitution <comma> violence <comma> drugs: <period> a  hard  place  to  grow  up <period> and  when  we  were  walking  through  the  narrow  alleys <comma> it  was  literally  impossible  not  to  step  in  the  raw  sewage  and  the  garbage  alongside  the  little  homes <period> but  at  the  same  time  it  was  also  impossible  not  to  see  the  human  vitality <comma> the  aspiration  and  the  ambition  of  the  people  who  live  there: <period> women  washing  their  babies <comma> washing  their  clothes <comma> hanging  them  out  to  dry <period> i  met  this  woman <comma> mama  rose <comma> who  has  rented  that  little  tin  shack  for  32  years <comma> where  she  lives  with  her  seven  children <period> four  sleep  in  one  twin  bed <comma> and  three  sleep  on  the  mud  and  linoleum  floor <period> and  she  keeps  them  all  in  school  by  selling  water  from  that  kiosk <comma> and  from  selling  soap  and  bread  from  the  little  store  inside <period> it  was  also  the  day  after  the  inauguration <comma> and  i  was  reminded  how  mathare  is  still  connected  to  the  globe <period> and  i  would  see  kids  on  the  street  corners <period> and  they'd  say  obama <comma> he  's  our  brother <period> and  i'd  say  well <comma> obama  's  my  brother <comma> so  that  makes  you  my  brother  too <period> and  they  would  look  quizzically <comma> and  then  be  like <comma> high  five <period> and  it  was  here  that  i  met  jane <period> i  was  struck  immediately  by  the  kindness  and  the  gentleness  in  her  face <comma> and  i  asked  her  to  tell  me  her  story <period> she  started  off  by  telling  me  her  dream <period> she  said <comma> i  had  two <period> my  first  dream  was  to  be  a  doctor <comma> and  the  second  was  to  marry  a  good  man  who  would  stay  with  me  and  my  family <period> because  my  mother  was  a  single  mom <comma> and  could  n't  afford  to  pay  for  school  fees <period> so  i  had  to  give  up  the  first  dream <comma> and  i  focused  on  the  second <period> she  got  married  when  she  was  18 <comma> had  a  baby  right  away <period> and  when  she  turned  20 <comma> found  herself  pregnant  with  a  second  child <comma> her  mom  died  and  her  husband  left  her <comma> married  another  woman <period> so  she  was  again  in  mathare <comma> with  no  income <comma> no  skill  set <comma> no  money <period> and  so  she  ultimately  turned  to  prostitution <period> it  was  n't  organized  in  the  way  we  often  think  of  it <period> she  would  go  into  the  city  at  night  with  about  20  girls <comma> look  for  work <comma> and  sometimes  come  back  with  a  few  shillings <period> or  sometimes  with  nothing <period> and  she  said <comma> you  know <comma> the  poverty  was  n't  so  bad <period> it  was  the  humiliation <period> and  the  embarrassment  of  it  all <period> in  2001 <comma> her  life  changed <period> she  had  a  girlfriend  who  had  heard  about  this  organization <comma> jamii  bora <comma> that  would  lend  money  to  people  no  matter  how  poor  you  were <comma> as  long  as  you  provided  a  commensurate  amount  in  savings <period> and  so  she  spent  a  year  to  save  50  dollars <comma> and  started  borrowing <comma> and  over  time  she  was  able  to  buy  a  sewing  machine <period> she  started  tailoring <period> and  that  turned  into  what  she  does  now <comma> which  is  to  go  into  the  secondhand  clothing  markets <comma> and  for  about  three  dollars  and  25  cents  she  buys  an  old  ball  gown <period> some  of  them  might  be  ones  you  gave <period> and  she  repurposes  them  with  frills  and  ribbons <comma> and  makes  these  frothy  confections  that  she  sells  to  women  for  their  daughter  's  sweet  16  or  first  holy  communion <comma> those  milestones  in  a  life  that  people  want  to  celebrate <period> all  along  the  economic  spectrum <period> and  she  does  really  good  business <period> in  fact <comma> i  watched  her  walk  through  the  streets  hawking <period> and  before  you  knew  it <comma> there  was  a  crowd  of  women  around  her <comma> buying  these  dresses <period> and  i  reflected <comma> as  i  was  watching  her  sell  the  dresses <comma> and  also  the  jewelry  that  she  makes <comma> that  now  jane  makes  more  than  four  dollars  a  day <period> and  by  many  definitions  she  is  no  longer  poor <period> but  she  still  lives  in  mathare  valley <period> and  so  she  cannot  move  out <period> she  lives  with  all  of  that  insecurity <comma> and  in  fact <comma> in  january <comma> during  the  ethnic  riots <comma> she  was  chased  from  her  home  and  had  to  find  a  new  shack <period> in  which  she  would  live <period> jamii  bora  understands  that  and  understands  that  when  we  're  talking  about  poverty <comma> we've  got  to  look  at  people  all  along  the  economic  spectrum <period> and  so  with  patient  capital  from  acumen  and  other  organizations <comma> loans  and  investments  that  will  go  the  long  term  with  them <comma> they  built  a  low-cost  housing  development <comma> about  an  hour  outside  nairobi  central <period> and  they  designed  it  from  the  perspective  of  customers  like  jane  herself <comma> insisting  on  responsibility  and  accountability <period> so  she  has  to  give  10  percent  of  the  mortgage <comma> of  the  total  value <comma> or  about  400  dollars  in  savings <period> and  then  they  match  her  mortgage  to  what  she  paid  in  rent  for  her  little  shanty <period> and  in  the  next  couple  of  weeks <comma> she  's  going  to  be  among  the  first  200  families  to  move  into  this  development <period> when  i  asked  her  if  she  feared  anything <comma> or  whether  she  would  miss  anything  from  mathare <comma> she  said <comma> what  would  i  fear <period> that  i  have  n't  confronted  already <questionmark> i  'm  hiv  positive <period> i've  dealt  with  it  all <period> and  she  said <comma> what  would  i  miss <questionmark> you  think  i  will  miss  the  violence  or  the  drugs <questionmark> the  lack  of  privacy <questionmark> do  you  think  i  'll  miss  not  knowing  if  my  children  are  going  to  come  home  at  the  end  of  the  day  she  said  if  you  gave  me  10  minutes <period> my  bags  would  be  packed <period> i  said <comma> well  what  about  your  dreams <questionmark> and  she  said <comma> well <comma> you  know <comma> my  dreams  do  n't  look  exactly  like  i  thought  they  would  when  i  was  a  little  girl <period> but  if  i  think  about  it <comma> i  thought  i  wanted  a  husband <comma> but  what  i  really  wanted  was  a  family <period> that  was  loving <period> and  i  fiercely  love  my  children <comma> and  they  love  me  back <period> she  said <comma> i  thought  that  i  wanted  to  be  a  doctor <comma> but  what  i  really  wanted  to  be  was  somebody <period> who  served  and  healed  and  cured <period> and  so  i  feel  so  blessed  with  everything  that  i  have <comma> that  two  days  a  week  i  go  and  i  counsel  hiv  patients <period> and  i  say <comma> look  at  me <period> you  are  not  dead <period> you  are  still  alive <period> and  if  you  are  still  alive  you  have  to  serve' <period> and  she  said <comma> i  'm  not  a  doctor  who  gives  out  pills <period> but  maybe  me <comma> i  give  out  something  better <period> because  i  give  them  hope <period> and  in  the  middle  of  this  economic  crisis <comma> where  so  many  of  us  are  inclined  to  pull  in  with  fear <comma> i  think  we  're  well  suited  to  take  a  cue  from  jane  and  reach  out <comma> recognizing  that  being  poor  does  n't  mean  being  ordinary <period> because  when  systems  are  broken <comma> like  the  ones  that  we  're  seeing  around  the  world <comma> it  's  an  opportunity  for  invention  and  for  innovation <period> it  's  an  opportunity  to  truly  build  a  world  where  we  can  extend  services  and  products  to  all  human  beings <comma> so  that  they  can  make  decisions  and  choices  for  themselves <period> i  truly  believe  it  's  where  dignity  starts <period> we  owe  it  to  the  janes  of  the  world <period> and  just  as  important <comma> we  owe  it  to  ourselves <period> thank  you <period> this  is  the  first  of  two  rather  extraordinary  photographs  i  'm  going  to  show  you  today <period> it  was  taken  18  years  ago <period> i  was  19  years  old  at  the  time <period> i  had  just  returned  from  one  of  the  deepest  dives  i'd  ever  made  at  that  time, <comma> a  little  over  200  feet  -- <period> and <comma> i  had  caught  this  little  fish  here <period> it  turns  out  that  that  particular  one  was  the  first  live  one  of  that  ever  taken  alive <period> i  'm  not  just  an  ichthyologist <comma> i  'm  a  bona  fide  fish  nerd <period> and  to  a  fish  nerd <comma> this  is  some  pretty  exciting  stuff <period> and  more  exciting  was  the  fact  that  the  person  who  took  this  photo  was  a  guy  named  jack  randall <comma> the  greatest  living  ichthyologist  on  earth <comma> the  grand  poobah  of  fish  nerds <comma> if  you  will <period> and  so <comma> it  was  really  exciting  to  me  to  have  this  moment  in  time <comma> it  really  set  the  course  for  the  rest  of  my  life <period> but  really  the  most  significant  thing <comma> the  most  profound  thing  about  this  picture  is  that  it  was  taken  two  days  before  i  was  completely  paralyzed  from  the  neck  down <period> i  made  a  really  stupid  kind  of  mistake  that  most  19-year-old  males  do  when  they  think  they  're  immortal <comma> and  i  got  a  bad  case  of  the  bends <comma> and  was  paralyzed <comma> and  had  to  be  flown  back  for  treatment <period> i  learned  two  really  important  things  that  day <period> the  first  thing  i  learned <comma> well <comma> i  'm  mortal <comma> that  's  a  really  big  one <period> and  the  second  thing  i  learned  was  that  i  knew <comma> with  profound  certainty <comma> that  this  is  exactly  what  i  was  going  to  do  for  the  rest  of  my  life <period> i  had  to  focus  all  my  energies  towards  going  to  find  new  species  of  things  down  on  deep  coral  reefs <period> now <comma> when  you  think  of  a  coral  reef <comma> this  is  what  most  people  think  of <comma> all  these  big <comma> hard <comma> elaborate  corals  and  lots  of  bright <comma> colorful  fishes  and  things <period> but <comma> this  is  really  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg <period> if  you  look  at  this  diagram  of  a  coral  reef <comma> we  know  a  lot  about  that  part  up  near  the  top <comma> and  the  reason  we  know  so  much  about  it  is  scuba  divers  can  very  easily  go  down  there  and  access  it <period> there  is  a  problem  with  scuba  though <comma> in  that  it  imposes  some  limitations  on  how  deep  you  can  go <comma> and  it  turns  out  that  depth  is  about  200  feet <period> i  'll  get  into  why  that  is  in  just  a  minute <period> but <comma> the  point  is  that  scuba  divers  generally  stay  less  than  100  feet  deep <comma> and  very  rarely  go  much  below  this <comma> at  least <comma> not  with  any  kind  of  sanity <period> so <comma> to  go  deeper <comma> most  biologists  have  turned  to  submersibles <period> now <comma> submersibles  are  great <comma> wonderful  things <comma> but  if  you  're  going  to  spend  30,000  dollars  a  day  to  use  one  of  these  things <comma> and  it  's  capable  of  going  2,000  feet <comma> you  're  sure  not  going  to  go  farting  around  up  here  in  a  couple  of  hundred  feet <comma> you  're  going  to  go  way <comma> way <comma> way <comma> down  deep <period> so <comma> the  bottom  line  is  that  almost  all  research  using  submersibles  has  taken  place  well  below  500  feet <period> now <comma> it  's  pretty  obvious  at  this  point  that  there  's  this  zone  here  in  the  middle  and  that  's  the  zone  that  really  centers  around  my  own  personal  pursuit  of  happiness <period> i  want  to  find  out  what  's  in  this  zone <period> we  know  almost  nothing  about  it <period> scuba  divers  cannot  get  there <comma> submarines  go  right  on  past  it <period> it  took  me  a  year  to  learn  how  to  walk  again  after  i  had  my  diving  accident  in  palau  and  during  that  year  i  spent  a  lot  of  time  learning  about  the  physics  and  physiology  of  diving  and  figuring  out  how  to  overcome  these  limitations <period> so <comma> i  'm  just  going  to  show  you  a  basic  idea <period> we  're  all  breathing  air  right  now <period> air  is  a  mixture  of  oxygen  and  nitrogen <comma> about  20  percent  oxygen <period> about  80  percent  nitrogen  is  in  our  lungs <period> and  there  's  a  phenomenon  called  henry  's  law  that  says  that  gases  will  dissolve  into  a  fluid  in  proportion  to  the  partial  pressures  which  you  're  exposing  them  to <period> so <comma> basically  the  gas  dissolves  into  our  body <period> the  oxygen  is  bound  by  metabolism <comma> we  use  it  for  energy <period> the  nitrogen  just  sort  of  floats  around  in  our  blood  and  tissues <comma> and  that  's  all  fine <comma> that  's  how  we  're  designed <period> the  problem  happens  when  you  start  to  go  underwater <period> now <comma> the  deeper  you  go  underwater <comma> the  higher  the  pressure  is <period> if  you  were  to  go  down  to  a  depth  of  about  130  feet <comma> which  is  the  recommended  limit  for  most  scuba  divers <comma> you  get  this  pressure  effect <period> and  the  effect  of  that  pressure  is  that  you  have  an  increased  density  of  gas  molecules  in  every  breath  you  take <period> over  time <comma> those  gas  molecules  dissolve  into  your  blood  and  tissues  and  start  to  fill  you  up <period> now <comma> if  you  were  to  go  down  to <comma> say <comma> 300  feet <comma> you  do  n't  have  five  times  as  many  gas  molecules  in  your  lungs <comma> you've  got  10  times  as  many  gas  molecules  in  your  lungs <period> and <comma> sure  enough <comma> they  dissolve  into  your  blood <comma> and  into  your  tissues  as  well <period> and  of  course <comma> if  you  were  to  down  to  where  there  's  15  times  as  much <comma> the  deeper  you  go <comma> the  more  exacerbating  the  problem  becomes <period> and  the  problem <comma> the  limitation  of  diving  with  air  is  all  those  dots  in  your  body <comma> all  the  nitrogen  and  all  the  oxygen <period> there  're  three  basic  limitations  of  scuba  diving <period> the  first  limitation  is  the  oxygen <comma> oxygen  toxicity <period> now <comma> we  all  know  the  song <comma> love  is  like  oxygen/ <period> you  get  too  much <comma> you  get  too  high/ <period> not  enough <comma> and  you  're  going  to  die <period> well <comma> in  the  context  of  diving <comma> you  get  too  much <comma> you  die  also <period> you  die  also  because  oxygen  toxicity  can  cause  a  seizure <comma> makes  you  convulse  underwater <comma> not  a  good  thing  to  happen  underwater <period> it  happens  because  there  's  too  much  concentration  of  oxygen  in  your  body <period> the  nitrogen  has  two  problems <period> one  of  them  is  what  jacques  cousteau  called  rapture  of  the  deep <period> it  's  nitrogen  narcosis <period> it  makes  you  loopy <period> the  deeper  you  go <comma> the  loopier  you  get <period> you  do  n't  want  to  drive  drunk <comma> you  do  n't  want  to  dive  drunk <comma> so  that  's  a  real  big  problem <period> and  of  course <comma> the  third  problem  is  the  one  i  found  out  the  hard  way  in  palau <comma> which  is  the  bends <period> now  the  one  thing  that  i  forgot  to  mention <comma> is  that  to  obviate  the  problem  of  the  nitrogen  narcosis <comma> all  of  those  blue  dots  in  our  body <comma> you  remove  the  nitrogen  and  you  replace  it  with  helium <period> now  helium  's  a  gas <comma> there  're  a  lot  of  reasons  why  helium  's  good <comma> it  's  a  tiny  molecule <comma> it  's  inert <comma> it  does  n't  give  you  narcosis <period> so  that  's  the  basic  concept  that  we  use <period> but <comma> the  theory  's  relatively  easy <period> the  tricky  part  is  the  implementation <period> so <comma> this  is  how  i  began <comma> about  15  years  ago <period> i  'll  admit <comma> it  was  n't  exactly  the  smartest  of  starts <comma> but <comma> you  know <comma> you  got  to  start  somewhere <period> at  the  time <comma> i  was  n't  the  only  one  who  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing <comma> almost  nobody  did <period> and  this  rig  was  actually  used  for  a  dive  of  300  feet <period> over  time  we  got  a  little  bit  better  at  it <comma> and  we  came  up  with  this  really  sophisticated-looking  rig  with  four  scuba  tanks  and  five  regulators  and  all  the  right  gas  mixtures  and  all  that  good  stuff <period> and  it  was  fine  and  dandy <comma> and  it  allowed  us  to  go  down  and  find  new  species <period> this  picture  was  taken  300  feet  deep <comma> catching  new  species  of  fish <period> but <comma> the  problem  was  that  it  did  n't  allow  us  much  time <period> for  all  its  bulk  and  size <comma> it  only  gave  us  about  15  minutes  at  most  down  at  those  sorts  of  depths <period> we  needed  more  time <period> there  had  to  be  a  better  way <period> and <comma> indeed <comma> there  is  a  better  way <period> in  1994 <comma> i  was  fortunate  enough  to  get  access  to  these  prototype  closed-circuit  rebreathers <period> alright <comma> closed-circuit  rebreather <comma> what  is  it  about  it  that  makes  it  different  from  scuba <comma> and  why  is  it  better <questionmark> well <comma> there  are  three  main  advantages  to  a  rebreather <period> one <comma> they  're  quiet <comma> they  do  n't  make  any  noise <period> two <comma> they  allow  you  to  stay  underwater  longer <period> three <comma> they  allow  you  to  go  deeper <period> how  is  it  that  they  do  that <questionmark> well <comma> in  order  to  really  understand  how  they  do  that  you  have  to  take  off  the  hood <comma> and  look  underneath  and  see  what  's  going  on <period> there  are  three  basic  systems  to  a  closed-  circuit  rebreather <period> the  most  fundamental  of  these  is  called  the  breathing  loop <period> it  's  a  breathing  loop  because  you  breathe  off  of  it <comma> and  it  's  a  closed  loop <comma> and  you  breathe  the  same  gas  around  and  around  and  around <period> so  there  's  a  mouthpiece  that  you  put  in  your  mouth <comma> and  there  's  also  a  counterlung <comma> or  in  this  case <comma> two  counterlungs <period> now <comma> the  counterlungs  are  n't  high-tech <comma> they  're  just  simply  flexible  bags <period> they  allow  you  to  mechanically  breathe <comma> or  mechanically  ventilate <period> when  you  exhale  your  breath <comma> it  goes  in  the  exhale  counterlung <comma> when  you  inhale  a  breath <comma> it  comes  from  the  inhale  counterlung <period> it  's  just  pure  mechanics <comma> allowing  you  to  cycle  air  through  this  breathing  loop <period> and <comma> the  other  component  on  a  breathing  loop  is  the  carbon  dioxide  absorbent  canister <period> now <comma> as  we  breathe <comma> we  produce  carbon  dioxide <comma> and  that  carbon  dioxide  needs  to  be  scrubbed  out  of  the  system <period> there  's  a  chemical  filter  in  there  that  pulls  the  carbon  dioxide  out  of  the  breathing  gas <comma> so  that <comma> when  it  comes  back  to  us  to  breathe  again <comma> it  's  safe  to  breathe  again <period> so  that  's  the  breathing  loop  in  a  nutshell <period> the  second  main  component  of  a  closed-circuit  rebreather  is  the  gas  system <period> the  primary  purpose  of  the  gas  system  is  to  provide  oxygen <comma> to  replenish  the  oxygen  that  your  body  consumes <period> so  the  main  tank <comma> the  main  critical  thing <comma> is  this  oxygen  gas  supply  cylinder  we  have  here <period> but <comma> if  we  only  had  an  oxygen  gas  supply  cylinder  we  would  n't  be  able  to  go  very  deep <comma> because  we'd  run  into  oxygen  toxicity  very <comma> very  quickly <period> so  we  need  another  gas <comma> something  to  dilute  the  oxygen  with <period> and  that <comma> fittingly  enough <comma> is  called  the  diluent  gas  supply <period> in  our  applications <comma> we  generally  put  air  inside  this  diluent  gas  supply <comma> because  it  's  a  very  cheap  and  easy  source  of  nitrogen <period> so  that  's  where  we  get  our  nitrogen  from <period> but <comma> if  we  want  to  go  deeper <comma> of  course <comma> we  need  another  gas  supply <period> we  need  helium <comma> and  the  helium  is  what  we  really  need  to  go  deep <period> and  usually  we  'll  have  a  slightly  larger  cylinder  mounted  exterior  on  the  rebreather <comma> like  this <period> and  that  's  what  we  use  to  inject <comma> as  we  start  to  do  our  deep  dives <period> we  also  have  a  second  oxygen  cylinder <comma> that  's  solely  as  a  back-up  in  case  there  's  a  problem  with  our  first  oxygen  supply  we  can  continue  to  breathe <period> and  the  way  you  manage  all  these  different  gases  and  all  these  different  gas  supplies  is  this  really  high-tech <comma> sophisticated  gas  block  up  on  the  front  here <comma> where  it  's  easy  to  reach <period> it  's  got  all  the  valves  and  knobs  and  things  you  need  to  do  to  inject  the  right  gases  at  the  right  time <period> now <comma> normally  you  do  n't  have  to  do  that  because  all  of  it  's  done  automatically  for  you  with  the  electronics <comma> the  third  system  of  a  rebreather <period> the  most  critical  part  of  a  rebreather  is  the  oxygen  sensors <period> you  need  three  of  them <comma> so  that  if  one  of  them  goes  bad <comma> you  know  which  one  it  is <period> you  need  voting  logic <period> you  also  have  three  microprocessors <period> any  one  of  those  computers  can  run  the  entire  system <comma> so  if  you  have  to  lose  two  of  them <period> there  's  also  back-up  power  supplies <period> and  of  course  there  're  multiple  displays <comma> to  get  the  information  to  the  diver <period> this  is  the  high-tech  gadgetry  that  allows  us  to  do  what  we  do  on  these  kinds  of  deep  dives <period> and  i  can  talk  about  it  all  day <comma> just  ask  my  wife  -- <period> but  i  want  to  move  on  to  something  that  's  kind  of  much  more  interesting <period> i  'm  going  to  take  you  on  a  deep  dive <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  what  it  's  like  to  do  one  of  these  dives  that  we  do <period> we  start  up  here  on  the  boat <comma> and  for  all  this  high-tech <comma> expensive  equipment <comma> this  is  still  the  best  way  to  get  in  the  water <comma> just  pfft <comma> flop  over  the  side  of  the  boat <period> now <comma> as  i  showed  you  in  the  earlier  diagram <comma> these  reefs  that  we  dive  on  start  out  near  the  surface  and  they  go  almost  vertically <comma> completely  straight  down <period> so <comma> we  drop  in  the  water <comma> and  we  just  sort  of  go  over  the  edge  of  this  cliff <comma> and  then  we  just  start  dropping <comma> dropping <comma> dropping <period> people  have  asked  me <comma> it  must  take  a  long  time  to  get  there <questionmark> no <comma> it  only  takes  a  couple  of  minutes  to  get  all  the  way  down  to  three  or  four  hundred  feet <comma> which  is  where  we  're  aiming  for <period> it  's  kind  of  like  skydiving  in  slow  motion <period> it  's  really  a  very  interesting <comma> you  ever  see  the  abyss  where  ed  harris <comma> you  know <comma> he  's  sinking  down  along  the  side  of  the  wall <questionmark> that  's  kind  of  what  it  feels  like <period> it  's  pretty  amazing <period> also <comma> when  you  get  down  there <comma> you  find  that  the  water  is  very <comma> very  clear <period> it  's  extremely  clear  water <comma> because  there  's  hardly  any  plankton <period> but <comma> when  you  turn  on  your  light <comma> you  look  around  at  the  caves <comma> and  all  of  a  sudden  you  're  confronted  with  a  tremendous  amount  of  diversity <comma> much  more  than  anyone  used  to  believe <period> now  not  all  of  it  is  new  species <comma> like  that  fish  you  see  with  the  white  stripe <comma> that  's  a  known  species <period> but <comma> if  you  look  carefully  into  the  cracks  and  crevices <comma> you  'll  see  little  things  scurrying  all  over  the  place <period> there  's  a  just-unbelievable  diversity <period> it  's  not  just  fish <comma> either <period> these  are  crinoids <comma> sponges <comma> black  corals <period> there  're  some  more  fishes <period> and  those  fishes  that  you  see  right  now  are  new  species <period> they  're  still  new  species  because  i  had  a  video  camera  on  this  dive  instead  of  my  net <comma> so  they  're  still  waiting  down  there  for  someone  to  go  find  them <period> but  this  is  what  it  looks  like <comma> and  this  kind  of  habitat  just  goes  on  and  on  and  on  for  miles <period> this  is  papua <comma> new  guinea <period> now  little  fishes  and  invertebrates  are  n't  the  only  things  we  see  down  there <period> we  also  see  sharks <comma> much  more  regularly  than  i  would  have  expected  to <period> and  we  're  not  quite  sure  why <period> but  what  i  want  you  to  do  right  now  is  imagine  yourself  400  feet  underwater <comma> with  all  this  high-tech  gear  on  your  back <comma> you  're  in  a  remote  reef  off  papua <comma> new  guinea <comma> thousands  of  miles  from  the  nearest  recompression  chamber <comma> and  you  're  completely  surrounded  by  sharks <period> video <comma> look  at  those <period> uh-oh <period> uh-oh <period> i  think  we  have  their  attention <period> richard  pyle <comma> when  you  start  talking  like  donald  duck <comma> there  's  no  situation  in  the  world  that  can  seem  tense <period> so <comma> we  're  down  there <comma> and  this  is  at  400  feet <comma> that  's  looking  straight  up <comma> by  the  way <comma> so  you  can  get  a  sense  of  how  far  away  the  surface  is <period> and  if  you  're  a  biologist  and  you  know  about  sharks <comma> and  you  want  to  assess <comma> you  know <comma> how  much  jeopardy  am  i  really  in  here <comma> there  's  one  question  that  sort  of  jumps  to  the  forefront  of  your  mind  immediately  which  is <comma> diver  1   <comma> what  kind  of  sharks <questionmark> diver  2 <comma> uh <comma> silvertip  sharks <period> diver  1 <comma> oh <period> rp <comma> silvertip  sharks <comma> they  're  actually  three  species  of  sharks  here <period> the  silvertips  are  the  one  with  the  white  edges  on  the  fin <comma> and  there  're  also  gray  reef  sharks  and  some  hammerheads  off  in  the  distance <period> and  yes <comma> it  's  a  little  nerve-wracking <period> diver  2   <comma> hoo <period> that  little  guy  is  frisky <period> now <comma> you've  seen  video  like  this  on  tv  a  lot <comma> and  it  's  very  intimidating <comma> and  i  think  it  gives  the  wrong  impression  about  sharks <period> sharks  are  actually  not  very  dangerous  animals  and  that  's  why  we  were  n't  worried  much <comma> why  we  were  joking  around  down  there <period> more  people  are  killed  by  pigs <comma> more  people  are  killed  by  lightning  strikes <comma> more  people  are  killed  at  soccer  games  in  england <period> there  's  a  lot  of  other  ways  you  can  die <period> and  i  'm  not  making  that  stuff  up <period> coconuts <period> you  can  get  killed  by  a  coconut  more  likely  than  killed  by  a  shark <period> so  sharks  are  n't  quite  as  dangerous  as  most  people  make  them  out  to  be <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  know  if  any  of  you  get  us <period> news  and  world  report <comma> i  got  the  recent  issue <period> there  's  a  cover  story  all  about  the  great  explorers  of  our  time <period> the  last  article  is  an  article  entitled  no  new  frontiers <period> it  questions  whether  or  not  there  really  are  any  new  frontiers  out  there <comma> whether  there  are  any  real <comma> true <comma> hardcore  discoveries  that  can  still  be  made <period> and  this  is  my  favorite  line  from  the  article <period> as  a  fish  nerd <comma> i  have  to  laugh <comma> because  you  know  they  do  n't  call  us  fish  nerds  for  nothing <comma> we  actually  do  get  excited  about  finding  a  new  dorsal  spine  in  a  guppy <period> but <comma> it  's  much  more  than  that <period> and <comma> i  want  to  show  you  a  few  of  the  guppies  we've  found  over  the  years <period> this  one  's <comma> you  know <comma> you  can  see  how  ugly  it  is <period> even  if  you  ignore  the  scientific  value  of  this  thing <comma> just  look  at  the  monetary  value  of  this  thing <period> a  couple  of  these  ended  up  getting  sold  through  the  aquarium  trade  to  japan <comma> where  they  sold  for  15,000  dollars  apiece <period> that  's  half-a-million  dollars  per  pound <period> here  's  another  new  angelfish  we  discovered <period> this  one  we  actually  first  discovered  back  in  the  air  days <comma> the  bad  old  air  days <comma> as  we  used  to  say <comma> when  we  were  doing  these  kind  of  dives  with  air <period> we  were  at  360  feet <period> and  i  remember  coming  up  from  one  of  these  deep  dives <comma> and  i  had  this  fog <comma> and  the  narcosis  takes  a  little  while  to <comma> you  know <comma> fade  away <period> it  's  sort  of  like  sobering  up <period> and  i  had  this  vague  recollection  of  seeing  these  yellow  fish  with  a  black  spot <comma> and  i  thought <comma> aw <comma> damn <period> i  should  have  caught  one <period> i  think  that  's  a  new  species  and  then <comma> eventually <comma> i  got  around  to  looking  in  my  bucket <period> sure  enough <comma> i  had  caught  one <comma> i  just  completely  forgot  that  i  had  caught  one <period> and  so  this  one  we  decided  to  give  the  name  centropyge  narcosis  to <period> so  that  's  it  's  official  scientific  name <comma> in  reference  to  its  deep-dwelling  habits <period> and  this  is  another  neat  one <period> when  we  first  found  it <comma> we  were  n't  even  sure  what  family  this  thing  belonged  to <comma> so  we  just  called  it  the  dr.  seuss  fish <comma> because  it  looked  like  something  out  of  one  of  those  books <period> now <comma> this  one  's  pretty  cool <period> if  you  go  to  papua <comma> new  guinea <comma> and  go  down  300  feet <comma> you  're  going  to  see  these  big  mounds <period> and  this  may  be  kind  of  hard  to  see <comma> but  they  're  about <comma> oh <comma> a  couple  meters  in  diameter <period> if  you  look  closely <comma> you  'll  see  there  's  a  little  white  fish  and  gray  fish  that  hangs  out  near  them <period> well <comma> it  turns  out  this  little  white  fish  builds  these  giant  mounds <comma> one  pebble  at  a  time <period> it  's  really  extraordinary  to  find  something  like  this <period> it  's  not  just  new  species <comma> it  's  new  behavior <comma> it  's  new  ecology  it  's  all  kind  of  new  things <period> so <comma> what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  right  now <comma> very  quickly <comma> is  just  a  sampling  of  a  few  of  the  new  species  we've  discovered <period> what  's  extraordinary  about  this  is  not  just  the  sheer  number  of  species  we  're  finding <comma> although  as  you  can  see  that  's  pretty  amazing <comma> this  is  only  half  of  what  we've  found <comma> what  's  extraordinary  is  how  quickly  we  find  them <period> we  're  up  to  seven  new  species  per  hour  of  time  we  spend  at  that  depth <period> now <comma> if  you  go  to  an  amazon  jungle  and  fog  a  tree <comma> you  may  get  a  lot  of  bugs <comma> but  for  fishes <comma> there  's  nowhere  in  the  world  you  can  get  seven  new  species  per  hour  of  time <period> now <comma> we've  done  some  back  of  the  envelope  calculations <comma> and  we  're  predicting  that  there  are  probably  on  the  order  of  2,000  to  2,500  new  species  in  the  indo-pacific  alone <period> there  are  only  five  to  six  thousand  known  species <period> so  a  very  large  percentage  of  what  is  out  there  is  n't  really  known <period> we  thought  we  had  a  handle  on  all  the  reef  fish  diversity <comma> evidently  not <period> and  i  'm  going  to  just  close  on  a  very  somber  note <period> at  the  beginning  i  told  you  that  i  was  going  to  show  you  two  extraordinary  photographs <period> this  is  the  second  extraordinary  photograph  i  'm  going  to  show  you <period> this  one  was  taken  at  the  exact  moment  i  was  down  there  filming  those  sharks <period> this  was  taken  exactly  300  feet  above  my  head <period> and  the  reason  this  photograph  is  extraordinary  is  because  it  captures  a  moment  in  the  very  last  minute  of  a  person  's  life <period> less  than  60  seconds  after  this  picture  was  taken <comma> this  guy  was  dead <period> when  we  recovered  his  body <comma> we  figured  out  what  had  gone  wrong <period> he  had  made  a  very  simple  mistake <period> he  turned  the  wrong  valve  when  he  filled  his  cylinder <comma> he  had  80  percent  oxygen  in  his  tank  when  he  should  have  had  40 <period> he  had  an  oxygen  toxicity  seizure  and  he  drowned <period> the  reason  i  show  this <comma> not  to  put  a  downer  on  everything <comma> but  i  just  want  to  use  it  to  key  off  my  philosophy  of  life  in  general <comma> which  is  that  we  all  have  two  goals <period> the  first  goal  we  share  with  every  other  living  thing  on  this  planet <comma> which  is  to  survive <period> i  call  it  perpetuation: <period> the  survival  of  the  species  and  survival  of  ourselves <comma> because  they  're  both  about  perpetuating  the  genome <period> and  the  second  goal <comma> for  those  of  us  who  have  mastered  that  first  goal <comma> is  to <comma> you  know <comma> you  call  it  spiritual  fulfillment <comma> you  can  call  it  financial  success <comma> you  can  call  it  any  number  of  different  things <period> i  call  it  seeking  joy <comma> this  pursuit  of  happiness <period> so <comma> i  guess  my  theme  on  this  is  this  guy  lived  his  life  to  the  fullest <comma> he  absolutely  did <period> you  have  to  balance  those  two  goals <period> if  you  live  your  whole  life  in  fear <comma> i  mean <comma> life  is  a  sexually  transmitted  disease  with  100  percent  mortality <period> so <comma> you  cannot  live  your  life  in  fear <period> i  thought  that  was  an  old  one <period> but <comma> at  the  same  time  you  do  n't  want  to  get  so  focused  on  rule  number  two <comma> or  goal  number  two <comma> that  you  neglect  goal  number  one <period> because  once  you  're  dead <comma> you  really  cannot  enjoy  anything  after  that <period> i  wish  you  all  the  best  of  luck  in  maintaining  that  balance  in  your  future  endeavors <period> thanks <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  today  about  the  pleasures  of  everyday  life <period> but  i  want  to  begin  with  a  story  of  an  unusual  and  terrible  man <period> this  is  hermann  goering <period> goering  was  hitler  's  second  in  command  in  world  war  ii <comma> his  designated  successor <period> and  like  hitler <comma> goering  fancied  himself  a  collector  of  art <period> he  went  through  europe <comma> through  world  war  ii <comma> stealing <comma> extorting  and  occasionally  buying  various  paintings  for  his  collection <period> and  what  he  really  wanted  was  something  by  vermeer <period> hitler  had  two  of  them <comma> and  he  did  n't  have  any <period> so  he  finally  found  an  art  dealer <comma> a  dutch  art  dealer  named  han  van  meegeren <comma> who  sold  him  a  wonderful  vermeer  for  the  cost  of  what  would  now  be  10  million  dollars <period> and  it  was  his  favorite  artwork  ever <period> world  war  ii  came  to  an  end <comma> and  goering  was  captured <comma> tried  at  nuremberg  and  ultimately  sentenced  to  death <period> then  the  allied  forces  went  through  his  collections  and  found  the  paintings  and  went  after  the  people  who  sold  it  to  him <period> and  at  some  point  the  dutch  police  came  into  amsterdam  and  arrested  van  meegeren <period> van  meegeren  was  charged  with  the  crime  of  treason <comma> which  is  itself  punishable  by  death <period> six  weeks  into  his  prison  sentence <comma> van  meegeren  confessed <period> but  he  did  n't  confess  to  treason <period> he  said <comma> i  did  not  sell  a  great  masterpiece  to  that  nazi <period> i  painted  it  myself <period> i  'm  a  forger <period> now  nobody  believed  him <period> and  he  said <comma> i  'll  prove  it <period> bring  me  a  canvas  and  some  paint <comma> and  i  will  paint  a  vermeer  much  better  than  i  sold  that  disgusting  nazi <period> i  also  need  alcohol  and  morphine <comma> because  it  's  the  only  way  i  can  work <period> so  they  brought  him  in <period> he  painted  a  beautiful  vermeer <period> and  then  the  charges  of  treason  were  dropped <period> he  had  a  lesser  charge  of  forgery <comma> got  a  year  sentence  and  died  a  hero  to  the  dutch  people <period> there  's  a  lot  more  to  be  said  about  van  meegeren <comma> but  i  want  to  turn  now  to  goering <comma> who  's  pictured  here  being  interrogated  at  nuremberg <period> now  goering  was <comma> by  all  accounts <comma> a  terrible  man <period> even  for  a  nazi <comma> he  was  a  terrible  man <period> his  american  interrogators  described  him  as  an  amicable  psychopath <period> but  you  could  feel  sympathy  for  the  reaction  he  had  when  he  was  told  that  his  favorite  painting  was  actually  a  forgery <period> according  to  his  biographer <comma> he  looked  as  if  for  the  first  time  he  had  discovered  there  was  evil  in  the  world <period> and  he  killed  himself  soon  afterwards <period> he  had  discovered  after  all  that  the  painting  he  thought  was  this  was  actually  that <period> it  looked  the  same <comma> but  it  had  a  different  origin <comma> it  was  a  different  artwork <period> it  was  n't  just  him  who  was  in  for  a  shock <period> once  van  meegeren  was  on  trial <comma> he  could  n't  stop  talking <period> and  he  boasted  about  all  the  great  masterpieces  that  he  himself  had  painted  that  were  attributed  to  other  artists <period> in  particular <comma> the  supper  at  emmaus  which  was  viewed  as  vermeer  's  finest  masterpiece <comma> his  best  work <comma> people  would  come  from  all  over  the  world  to  see  it <comma> was  actually  a  forgery <period> it  was  not  that  painting <comma> but  that  painting <period> and  when  that  was  discovered <comma> it  lost  all  its  value  and  was  taken  away  from  the  museum <period> why  does  this  matter <questionmark> i  'm  a  psychologists <comma> why  do  origins  matter  so  much <questionmark> why  do  we  respond  so  much  to  our  knowledge  of  where  something  comes  from <questionmark> well  there  's  an  answer  that  many  people  would  give <period> many  sociologists  like  veblen  and  wolfe  would  argue  that  the  reason  why  we  take  origins  so  seriously  is  because  we  're  snobs <comma> because  we  're  focused  on  status <period> among  other  things <comma> if  you  want  to  show  off  how  rich  you  are <comma> how  powerful  you  are <comma> it  's  always  better  to  own  an  original  than  a  forgery  because  there  's  always  going  to  be  fewer  originals  than  forgeries <period> i  do  n't  doubt  that  that  plays  some  role <comma> but  what  i  want  to  convince  you  of  today  is  that  there  's  something  else  going  on <period> i  want  to  convince  you  that  humans  are <comma> to  some  extent <comma> natural  born  essentialists <period> what  i  mean  by  this  is  we  do  n't  just  respond  to  things  as  we  see  them <comma> or  feel  them <comma> or  hear  them <period> rather <comma> our  response  is  conditioned  on  our  beliefs <comma> about  what  they  really  are <comma> what  they  came  from <comma> what  they  're  made  of <comma> what  their  hidden  nature  is <period> i  want  to  suggest  that  this  is  true <comma> not  just  for  how  we  think  about  things <comma> but  how  we  react  to  things <period> so  i  want  to  suggest  that  pleasure  is  deep <comma> and  that  this  is  n't  true  just  for  higher  level  pleasures  like  art <comma> but  even  the  most  seemingly  simple  pleasures  are  affected  by  our  beliefs  about  hidden  essences <period> so  take  food <period> would  you  eat  this <questionmark> well <comma> a  good  answer  is <comma> it  depends <period> what  is  it <questionmark> some  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  pork <comma> but  not  beef <period> some  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  beef <comma> but  not  pork <period> few  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  a  rat  or  a  human <period> some  of  you  would  eat  it  only  if  it  's  a  strangely  colored  piece  of  tofu <period> that  's  not  so  surprising <period> but  what  's  more  interesting  is  how  it  tastes  to  you  will  depend  critically  on  what  you  think  you  're  eating <period> so  one  demonstration  of  this  was  done  with  young  children <period> how  do  you  make  children  not  just  be  more  likely  to  eat  carrots  and  drink  milk <comma> but  to  get  more  pleasure  from  eating  carrots  and  drinking  milk <comma> to  think  they  taste  better <questionmark> it  's  simple <comma> you  tell  them  they  're  from  mcdonald  's <period> they  believe  mcdonald  's  food  is  tastier <comma> and  it  leads  them  to  experience  it  as  tastier <period> how  do  you  get  adults  to  really  enjoy  wine <questionmark> it  's  very  simple <comma> pour  it  from  an  expensive  bottle <period> there  are  now  dozens <comma> perhaps  hundreds  of  studies  showing  that  if  you  believe  you  're  drinking  the  expensive  stuff <comma> it  tastes  better  to  you <period> this  was  recently  done  with  a  neuroscientific  twist <period> they  get  people  into  a  fmri  scanner <comma> and  while  they  're  lying  there <comma> through  a  tube <comma> they  get  to  sip  wine <period> in  front  of  them  on  a  screen  is  information  about  the  wine <period> everybody <comma> of  course <comma> drinks  exactly  the  same  wine <period> but  if  you  believe  you  're  drinking  expensive  stuff <comma> parts  of  the  brain  associated  with  pleasure  and  reward  light  up  like  a  christmas  tree <period> it  's  not  just  that  you  say  it  's  more  pleasurable <comma> you  say  you  like  it  more <comma> you  really  experience  it  in  a  different  way <period> or  take  sex <period> these  are  stimuli  i've  used  in  some  of  my  studies <period> and  if  you  simply  show  people  these  pictures <comma> they  'll  say  these  are  fairly  attractive  people <period> but  how  attractive  you  find  them <comma> how  sexually  or  romantically  moved  you  are  by  them <comma> rests  critically  on  who  you  think  you  're  looking  at <period> you  probably  think  the  picture  on  the  left  is  male <comma> the  one  on  the  right  is  female <period> if  that  belief  turns  out  to  be  mistaken <comma> it  will  make  a  difference <period> it  will  make  a  difference  if  they  turn  out  to  be  much  younger  or  much  older  than  you  think  they  are <period> it  will  make  a  difference  if  you  were  to  discover  that  the  person  you  're  looking  at  with  lust  is  actually  a  disguised  version  of  your  son  or  daughter <comma> your  mother  or  father <period> knowing  somebody  's  your  kin  typically  kills  the  libido <period> maybe  one  of  the  most  heartening  findings  from  the  psychology  of  pleasure  is  there  's  more  to  looking  good  than  your  physical  appearance <period> if  you  like  somebody <comma> they  look  better  to  you <period> this  is  why  spouses  in  happy  marriages  tend  to  think  that  their  husband  or  wife  looks  much  better  than  anyone  else  thinks  that  they  do <period> a  particularly  dramatic  example  of  this  comes  from  a  neurological  disorder  known  as  capgras  syndrome <period> so  capgras  syndrome  is  a  disorder  where  you  get  a  specific  delusion <period> sufferers  of  capgras  syndrome  believe  that  the  people  they  love  most  in  the  world  have  been  replaced  by  perfect  duplicates <period> now  often <comma> a  result  of  capgras  syndrome  is  tragic <period> people  have  murdered  those  that  they  loved <comma> believing  that  they  were  murdering  an  imposter <period> but  there  's  at  least  one  case  where  capgras  syndrome  had  a  happy  ending <period> this  was  recorded  in  1931 <period> research  described  a  woman  with  capgras  syndrome  who  complained  about  her  poorly  endowed  and  sexually  inadequate  lover <period> but  that  was  before  she  got  capgras  syndrome <period> after  she  got  it <comma> she  was  happy  to  report  that  she  has  discovered  that  he  possessed  a  double  who  was  rich <comma> virile <comma> handsome  and  aristocratic <period> of  course <comma> it  was  the  same  man <comma> but  she  was  seeing  him  in  different  ways <period> as  a  third  example <comma> consider  consumer  products <period> so  one  reason  why  you  might  like  something  is  its  utility <period> you  can  put  shoes  on  your  feet <period> you  can  play  golf  with  golf  clubs <period> and  chewed  up  bubble  gum  does  n't  do  anything  at  all  for  you <period> but  each  of  these  three  objects  has  value  above  and  beyond  what  it  can  do  for  you  based  on  its  history <period> the  golf  clubs  were  owned  by  john  f <period> kennedy  and  sold  for  three-quarters  of  a  million  dollars  at  auction <period> the  bubble  gum  was  chewed  up  by  pop  star  britney  spears  and  sold  for  several  hundreds  of  dollars <period> and  in  fact <comma> there  's  a  thriving  market  in  the  partially  eaten  food  of  beloved  people <period> the  shoes  are  perhaps  the  most  valuable  of  all <period> according  to  an  unconfirmed  report <comma> a  saudi  millionaire  offered  10  million  dollars  for  this  pair  of  shoes <period> they  were  the  ones  thrown  at  george  bush  at  an  iraqi  press  conference  several  years  ago <period> now  this  attraction  to  objects  does  n't  just  work  for  celebrity  objects <period> each  one  of  us <comma> most  people <comma> have  something  in  our  life  that  's  literally  irreplaceable <comma> in  that  it  has  value  because  of  its  history <comma> maybe  your  wedding  ring <comma> maybe  your  child  's  baby  shoes <comma> so  that  if  it  was  lost <comma> you  could  n't  get  it  back <period> you  could  get  something  that  looked  like  it  or  felt  like  it <comma> but  you  could  n't  get  the  same  object  back <period> with  my  colleagues  george  newman  and  gil  diesendruck <comma> we've  looked  to  see  what  sort  of  factors <comma> what  sort  of  history <comma> matters  for  the  objects  that  people  like <period> so  in  one  of  our  experiments <comma> we  asked  people  to  name  a  famous  person  who  they  adored <comma> a  living  person  they  adored <period> so  one  answer  was  george  clooney <period> then  we  asked  them <comma> how  much  would  you  pay  for  george  clooney  's  sweater <questionmark> and  the  answer  is  a  fair  amount <comma> more  than  you  would  pay  for  a  brand  new  sweater  or  a  sweater  owned  by  somebody  who  you  did  n't  adore <period> then  we  asked  other  groups  of  subjects <comma> we  gave  them  different  restrictions  and  different  conditions <period> so  for  instance <comma> we  told  some  people <comma> look <comma> you  can  buy  the  sweater <comma> but  you  cannot  tell  anybody  you  own  it <comma> and  you  cannot  resell  it <period> that  drops  the  value  of  it <comma> suggesting  that  that  's  one  reason  why  we  like  it <period> but  what  really  causes  an  effect  is  you  tell  people <comma> look <comma> you  could  resell  it <comma> you  could  boast  about  it <comma> but  before  it  gets  to  you <comma> it  's  thoroughly  washed <period> that  causes  a  huge  drop  in  the  value <period> as  my  wife  put  it <comma> you've  washed  away  the  clooney  cooties <period> so  let  's  go  back  to  art <period> i  would  love  a  chagall <period> i  love  the  work  of  chagall <period> if  people  want  to  get  me  something  at  the  end  of  the  conference <comma> you  could  buy  me  a  chagall <period> but  i  do  n't  want  a  duplicate <comma> even  if  i  cannot  tell  the  difference <period> that  's  not  because <comma> or  it  's  not  simply  because <comma> i  'm  a  snob  and  want  to  boast  about  having  an  original <period> rather <comma> it  's  because  i  want  something  that  has  a  specific  history <period> in  the  case  of  artwork <comma> the  history  is  special  indeed <period> the  philosopher  denis  dutton  in  his  wonderful  book  the  art  instinct  makes  the  case  that <comma> the  value  of  an  artwork  is  rooted  in  assumptions  about  the  human  performance  underlying  its  creation <period> and  that  could  explain  the  difference  between  an  original  and  a  forgery <period> they  may  look  alike <comma> but  they  have  a  different  history <period> the  original  is  typically  the  product  of  a  creative  act <comma> the  forgery  is  n't <period> i  think  this  approach  can  explain  differences  in  people  's  taste  in  art <period> this  is  a  work  by  jackson  pollock <period> who  here  likes  the  work  of  jackson  pollock <questionmark> okay <period> who  here <comma> it  does  nothing  for  them <questionmark> they  just  do  n't  like  it <period> i  'm  not  going  to  make  a  claim  about  who  's  right <comma> but  i  will  make  an  empirical  claim  about  people  's  intuitions <comma> which  is  that <comma> if  you  like  the  work  of  jackson  pollock <comma> you  'll  tend  more  so  than  the  people  who  do  n't  like  it  to  believe  that  these  works  are  difficult  to  create <comma> that  they  require  a  lot  of  time  and  energy  and  creative  energy <period> i  use  jackson  pollock  on  purpose  as  an  example  because  there  's  a  young  american  artist  who  paints  very  much  in  the  style  of  jackson  pollock <comma> and  her  work  was  worth  many  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars <comma> in  large  part  because  she  's  a  very  young  artist <period> this  is  marla  olmstead  who  did  most  of  her  work  when  she  was  three  years  old <period> the  interesting  thing  about  marla  olmstead  is  her  family  made  the  mistake  of  inviting  the  television  program  60  minutes  ii  into  their  house  to  film  her  painting <period> and  they  then  reported  that  her  father  was  coaching  her <period> when  this  came  out  on  television <comma> the  value  of  her  art  dropped  to  nothing <period> it  was  the  same  art <comma> physically <comma> but  the  history  had  changed <period> i've  been  focusing  now  on  the  visual  arts <comma> but  i  want  to  give  two  examples  from  music <period> this  is  joshua  bell <comma> a  very  famous  violinist <period> and  the  washington  post  reporter  gene  weingarten  decided  to  enlist  him  for  an  audacious  experiment <period> the  question  is <comma> how  much  would  people  like  joshua  bell <comma> the  music  of  joshua  bell <comma> if  they  did  n't  know  they  were  listening  to  joshua  bell <questionmark> so  he  got  joshua  bell  to  take  his  million  dollar  violin  down  to  a  washington  dc <period> subway  station  and  stand  in  the  corner  and  see  how  much  money  he  would  make <period> and  here  's  a  brief  clip  of  this <period> after  being  there  for  three-quarters  of  an  hour <comma> he  made  32  dollars <period> not  bad <period> it  's  also  not  good <period> apparently  to  really  enjoy  the  music  of  joshua  bell <comma> you  have  to  know  you  're  listening  to  joshua  bell <period> he  actually  made  20  dollars  more  than  that <comma> but  he  did  n't  count  it <period> because  this  woman  comes  up <comma> you  see  at  the  end  of  the  video <comma> she  comes  up <period> she  had  heard  him  at  the  library  of  congress  a  few  weeks  before  at  this  extravagant  black-tie  affair <period> so  she  's  stunned  that  he  's  standing  in  a  subway  station <period> so  she  's  struck  with  pity <period> she  reaches  into  her  purse  and  hands  him  a  20 <period> the  second  example  from  music  is  from  john  cage  's  modernist  composition <comma> 4'33 <period> as  many  of  you  know <comma> this  is  the  composition  where  the  pianist  sits  at  a  bench <comma> opens  up  the  piano  and  sits  and  does  nothing  for  four  minutes  and  33  seconds <comma> that  period  of  silence <period> and  people  have  different  views  on  this <period> but  what  i  want  to  point  out  is  you  can  buy  this  from  itunes <period> for  a  dollar  99 <comma> you  can  listen  to  that  silence <comma> which  is  different  than  other  forms  of  silence <period> now  i've  been  talking  so  far  about  pleasure <comma> but  what  i  want  to  suggest  is  that  everything  i've  said  applies  as  well  to  pain <period> and  how  you  think  about  what  you  're  experiencing <comma> your  beliefs  about  the  essence  of  it <comma> affect  how  it  hurts <period> one  lovely  experiment  was  done  by  kurt  gray  and  dan  wegner <period> what  they  did  was  they  hooked  up  harvard  undergraduates  to  an  electric  shock  machine <period> and  they  gave  them  a  series  of  painful  electric  shocks <period> so  it  was  a  series  of  five  painful  shocks <period> half  of  them  are  told  that  they  're  being  given  the  shocks  by  somebody  in  another  room <comma> but  the  person  in  the  other  room  does  n't  know  they  're  giving  them  shocks <period> there  's  no  malevolence <comma> they  're  just  pressing  a  button <period> the  first  shock  is  recorded  as  very  painful <period> the  second  shock  feels  less  painful <comma> because  you  get  a  bit  used  to  it <period> the  third  drops <comma> the  fourth <comma> the  fifth <period> the  pain  gets  less <period> in  the  other  condition <comma> they  're  told  that  the  person  in  the  next  room  is  shocking  them  on  purpose <comma> knows  they  're  shocking  them <period> the  first  shock  hurts  like  hell <period> the  second  shock  hurts  just  as  much <comma> and  the  third  and  the  fourth  and  the  fifth <period> it  hurts  more  if  you  believe  somebody  is  doing  it  to  you  on  purpose <period> the  most  extreme  example  of  this  is  that  in  some  cases <comma> pain  under  the  right  circumstances  can  transform  into  pleasure <period> humans  have  this  extraordinarily  interesting  property  that  will  often  seek  out  low-level  doses  of  pain  in  controlled  circumstances  and  take  pleasure  from  it <comma> as  in  the  eating  of  hot  chili  peppers  and  roller  coaster  rides <period> the  point  was  nicely  summarized  by  the  poet  john  milton  who  wrote <comma> the  mind  is  its  own  place <comma> and  in  itself  can  make  a  heaven  of  hell <comma> a  hell  of  heaven <period> and  i  'll  end  with  that <period> thank  you <period> it  is  a  thrill  to  be  here  at  a  conference  that  's  devoted  to  inspired  by  nature <comma> you  can  imagine <period> and  i  'm  also  thrilled  to  be  in  the  foreplay  section <period> did  you  notice  this  section  is  foreplay <questionmark> because  i  get  to  talk  about  one  of  my  favorite  critters <comma> which  is  the  western  grebe <period> you  have  n't  lived  until  you've  seen  these  guys  do  their  courtship  dance <period> i  was  on  bowman  lake  in  glacier  national  park <comma> which  is  a  long <comma> skinny  lake  with  sort  of  mountains  upside  down  in  it <comma> and  my  partner  and  i  have  a  rowing  shell <period> and  so  we  were  rowing <comma> and  one  of  these  western  grebes  came  along <period> and  what  they  do  for  their  courtship  dance  is <comma> they  go  together <comma> the  two  of  them <comma> the  two  mates <comma> and  they  begin  to  run  underwater <period> they  paddle  faster <comma> and  faster <comma> and  faster <comma> until  they  're  going  so  fast  that  they  literally  lift  up  out  of  the  water <comma> and  they  're  standing  upright <comma> sort  of  paddling  the  top  of  the  water <period> and  one  of  these  grebes  came  along  while  we  were  rowing <period> and  so  we  're  in  a  skull <comma> and  we  're  moving  really <comma> really  quickly <period> and  this  grebe <comma> i  think <comma> sort  of <comma> mistaked  us  for  a  prospect <comma> and  started  to  run  along  the  water  next  to  us <comma> in  a  courtship  dance <comma> for  miles <period> it  would  stop <comma> and  then  start <comma> and  then  stop <comma> and  then  start <period> now  that  is  foreplay <period> i  came  this  close  to  changing  species  at  that  moment <period> obviously <comma> life  can  teach  us  something  in  the  entertainment  section <period> life  has  a  lot  to  teach  us <period> but  what  i'd  like  to  talk  about  today  is  what  life  might  teach  us  in  technology  and  in  design <period> what  's  happened  since  the  book  came  out <comma> the  book  was  mainly  about  research  in  biomimicry  -- <period> and  what  's  happened  since  then  is  architects <comma> designers <comma> engineers <comma> people  who  make  our  world <comma> have  started  to  call  and  say <comma> we  want  a  biologist  to  sit  at  the  design  table  to  help  us <comma> in  real  time <comma> become  inspired <period> or <comma> and  this  is  the  fun  part  for  me <comma> we  want  you  to  take  us  out  into  the  natural  world <period> we  'll  come  with  a  design  challenge  and  we  find  the  champion  adapters  in  the  natural  world <comma> who  might  inspire  us <period> so  this  is  a  picture  from  a  galapagos  trip  that  we  took  with  some  wastewater  treatment  engineers <period> they  purify  wastewater <period> and  some  of  them  were  very  resistant <comma> actually <comma> to  being  there <period> what  they  said  to  us  at  first  was <comma> you  know <comma> we  already  do  biomimicry <period> we  use  bacteria  to  clean  our  water <period> and  we  said <comma> well <comma> that  's  not  exactly  being  inspired  by  nature <period> that  's  bioprocessing <comma> you  know <period> that  's  bio-assisted  technology <comma> using  an  organism  to  do  your  wastewater  treatment  is  an  old <comma> old  technology  called  domestication <period> this  is  learning  something <comma> learning  an  idea <comma> from  an  organism  and  then  applying  it <period> and  so  they  still  were  n't  getting  it <period> so  we  went  for  a  walk  on  the  beach  and  i  said <comma> well <comma> give  me  one  of  your  big  problems <period> give  me  a  design  challenge <comma> sustainability  speed  bump <comma> that  's  keeping  you  from  being  sustainable <period> and  they  said  scaling <comma> which  is  the  build-up  of  minerals  inside  of  pipes <period> and  they  said <comma> you  know  what  happens  is <comma> mineral <comma> just  like  at  your  house <comma> mineral  builds  up <period> and  then  the  aperture  closes <comma> and  we  have  to  flush  the  pipes  with  toxins <comma> or  we  have  to  dig  them  up <period> so  if  we  had  some  way  to  stop  this  scaling <comma> and  so  i  picked  up  some  shells  on  the  beach <period> and  i  asked  them <comma> what  is  scaling <questionmark> what  's  inside  your  pipes <questionmark> and  they  said <comma> calcium  carbonate <period> and  i  said <comma> that  's  what  this  is <period> this  is  calcium  carbonate <period> and  they  did  n't  know  that <period> they  did  n't  know  that  what  a  seashell  is <comma> it  's  templated  by  proteins <comma> and  then  ions  from  the  seawater  crystallize  in  place  to  create  a  shell <period> so  the  same  sort  of  a  process <comma> without  the  proteins <comma> is  happening  on  the  inside  of  their  pipes <period> they  did  n't  know <period> this  is  not  for  lack  of  information <period> it  's  a  lack  of  integration <period> you  know <comma> it  's  a  silo <comma> people  in  silos <period> they  did  n't  know  that  the  same  thing  was  happening <period> so  one  of  them  thought  about  it  and  said <comma> ok <comma> well <comma> if  this  is  just  crystallization  that  happens  automatically  out  of  seawater <comma> self-assembly <comma> then  why  are  n't  shells  infinite  in  size <questionmark> what  stops  the  scaling <questionmark> why  do  n't  they  just  keep  on  going <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> well <comma> in  the  same  way  that  they  exude  a  protein  and  it  starts  the  crystallization <comma> and  then  they  all  sort  of  leaned  in <comma> they  let  go  of  a  protein  that  stops  the  crystallization <period> it  literally  adheres  to  the  growing  face  of  the  crystal <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> there  is  a  product  called  tpa  that  's  mimicked  that  protein <comma> that  stop-protein <comma> and  it  's  an  environmentally  friendly  way  to  stop  scaling  in  pipes <period> that  changed  everything <period> from  then  on <comma> you  could  not  get  these  engineers  back  in  the  boat <period> the  first  day  they  would  take  a  hike <comma> and  it  was <comma> click <comma> click <comma> click <comma> click <period> five  minutes  later  they  were  back  in  the  boat <period> we  're  done <period> you  know <comma> i've  seen  that  island <period> after  this <comma> they  were  crawling  all  over <period> they  would  snorkel  for  as  long  as  we  would  let  them  snorkel <period> what  had  happened  was  that  they  realized  that  there  were  organisms  out  there  that  had  already  solved  the  problems  that  they  had  spent  their  careers  trying  to  solve <period> learning  about  the  natural  world  is  one  thing <period> learning  from  the  natural  world <comma> that  's  the  switch <period> that  's  the  profound  switch <period> what  they  realized  was  that  the  answers  to  their  questions  are  everywhere <period> they  just  needed  to  change  the  lenses  with  which  they  saw  the  world <period> 38  billion  years  of  field-testing <period> 10  to  30 <comma> craig  venter  will  probably  tell  you <period> i  think  there  's  a  lot  more  than  30  million <comma> well-adapted  solutions <period> the  important  thing  for  me  is  that  these  are  solutions  solved  in  context <period> and  the  context  is  the  earth <comma> the  same  context  that  we  're  trying  to  solve  our  problems  in <period> so  it  's  the  conscious  emulation  of  life  's  genius <period> it  's  not  slavishly  mimicking <comma> although  al  is  trying  to  get  the  hairdo  going <comma> it  's  not  a  slavish  mimicry <period> it  's  taking  the  design  principles <comma> the  genius  of  the  natural  world <comma> and  learning  something  from  it <period> now <comma> in  a  group  with  so  many  it  people <comma> i  do  have  to  mention  what  i  'm  not  going  to  talk  about <comma> and  that  is  that  your  field  is  one  that  has  learned  an  enormous  amount  from  living  things <comma> on  the  software  side <period> so  there  's  computers  that  protect  themselves <comma> like  an  immune  system <comma> and  we  're  learning  from  gene  regulation  and  biological  development <period> and  we  're  learning  from  neural  nets <comma> genetic  algorithms <comma> evolutionary  computing <period> that  's  on  the  software  side <period> but  what  's  interesting  to  me  is  that  we  have  n't  looked  at  this <comma> as  much <period> i  mean <comma> these  machines  are  really  not  very  high  tech  in  my  estimation  in  the  sense  that  there  's  dozens  and  dozens  of  carcinogens  in  the  water  in  silicon  valley <period> so  the  hardware  is  not  at  all  up  to  snuff  in  terms  of  what  life  would  call  a  success <period> so  what  can  we  learn  about  making <comma> not  just  computers <comma> but  everything <questionmark> the  plane  you  came  in <comma> cars <comma> the  seats  that  you  're  sitting  on <period> how  do  we  redesign  the  world  that  we  make <comma> the  human-made  world <questionmark> more  importantly <comma> what  should  we  ask  in  the  next  10  years <questionmark> and  there  's  a  lot  of  cool  technologies  out  there  that  life  has <period> what  's  the  syllabus <questionmark> three  questions <comma> for  me <comma> are  key <period> how  does  life  make  things <questionmark> this  is  the  opposite <period> this  is  how  we  make  things <period> it  's  called  heat <comma> beat  and  treat <comma> that  's  what  material  scientists  call  it <period> and  it  's  carving  things  down  from  the  top <comma> with  96  percent  waste  left  over  and  only  4  percent  product <period> you  heat  it  up <period> you  beat  it  with  high  pressures <period> you  use  chemicals <period> ok <period> heat <comma> beat  and  treat <period> life  cannot  afford  to  do  that <period> how  does  life  make  things <questionmark> how  does  life  make  the  most  of  things <questionmark> that  's  a  geranium  pollen <period> and  its  shape  is  what  gives  it  the  function  of  being  able  to  tumble  through  air  so  easily <period> look  at  that  shape <period> life  adds  information  to  matter <period> in  other  words <comma> structure <period> it  gives  it  information <period> by  adding  information  to  matter <comma> it  gives  it  a  function  that  's  different  than  without  that  structure <period> and  thirdly <comma> how  does  life  make  things  disappear  into  systems <questionmark> because  life  does  n't  really  deal  in  things <period> there  are  no  things  in  the  natural  world  divorced  from  their  systems <period> really  quick  syllabus <period> as  i  'm  reading  more  and  more  now <comma> and  following  the  story <comma> there  are  some  amazing  things  coming  up  in  the  biological  sciences <period> and  at  the  same  time <comma> i  'm  listening  to  a  lot  of  businesses  and  finding  what  their  sort  of  grand  challenges  are <period> the  two  groups  are  not  talking  to  each  other <period> at  all <period> what  in  the  world  of  biology  might  be  helpful  at  this  juncture <comma> to  get  us  through  this  sort  of  evolutionary  knothole  that  we  're  in <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  try  to  go  through  12 <comma> really  quickly <period> one  that  's  exciting  to  me  is  self-assembly <period> now <comma> you've  heard  about  this  in  terms  of  nanotechnology <period> back  to  that  shell <comma> the  shell  is  a  self-assembling  material <period> on  the  lower  left  there  is  a  picture  of  mother  of  pearl  forming  out  of  seawater <period> it  's  a  layered  structure  that  's  mineral  and  then  polymer <comma> and  it  makes  it  very <comma> very  tough <period> it  's  twice  as  tough  as  our  high-tech  ceramics <period> but  what  's  really  interesting <comma> unlike  our  ceramics  that  are  in  kilns <comma> it  happens  in  seawater <period> it  happens  near <comma> in  and  near <comma> the  organism  's  body <period> this  is  sandia  national  labs <period> a  guy  named  jeff  brinker  has  found  a  way  to  have  a  self-assembling  coding  process <period> imagine  being  able  to  make  ceramics  at  room  temperature  by  simply  dipping  something  into  a  liquid <comma> lifting  it  out  of  the  liquid <comma> and  having  evaporation  force  the  molecules  in  the  liquid  together <comma> so  that  they  jigsaw  together  in  the  same  way  as  this  crystallization  works <period> imagine  making  all  of  our  hard  materials  that  way <period> imagine  spraying  the  precursors  to  a  pv  cell <comma> to  a  solar  cell <comma> onto  a  roof <comma> and  having  it  self-assemble  into  a  layered  structure  that  harvests  light <period> here  's  an  interesting  one  for  the  it  world <comma> bio-silicon <period> this  is  a  diatom <comma> which  is  made  of  silicates <period> and  so  silicon <comma> which  we  make  right  now <comma> it  's  part  of  our  carcinogenic  problem  in  the  manufacture  of  our  chips <comma> this  is  a  bio-mineralization  process  that  's  now  being  mimicked <period> this  is  at  uc  santa  barbara <period> look  at  these  diatoms <period> this  is  from  ernst  haeckel  's  work <period> imagine  being  able  to <comma> and <comma> again <comma> it  's  a  templated  process <comma> and  it  solidifies  out  of  a  liquid  process <comma> imagine  being  able  to  have  that  sort  of  structure  coming  out  at  room  temperature <period> imagine  being  able  to  make  perfect  lenses <period> on  the  left <comma> this  is  a  brittle  star <period> it  's  covered  with  lenses  that  the  people  at  lucent  technologies  have  found  have  no  distortion  whatsoever <period> it  's  one  of  the  most  distortion-free  lenses  we  know  of <period> and  there  's  many  of  them <comma> all  over  its  entire  body <period> what  's  interesting <comma> again <comma> is  that  it  self-assembles <period> a  woman  named  joanna  aizenberg <comma> at  lucent <comma> is  now  learning  to  do  this  in  a  low-temperature  process  to  create  these  sort  of  lenses <period> she  's  also  looking  at  fiber  optics <period> that  's  a  sea  sponge  that  has  a  fiber  optic <period> down  at  the  very  base  of  it <comma> there  's  fiber  optics  that  work  better  than  ours <comma> actually <comma> to  move  light <period> but  you  can  tie  them  in  a  knot <period> they  're  incredibly  flexible <period> here  's  another  big  idea <comma> co2  as  a  feedstock <period> a  guy  named  geoff  coates <comma> at  cornell <comma> said  to  himself <comma> you  know <comma> plants  do  not  see  co2  as  the  biggest  poison  of  our  time <period> we  see  it  that  way <period> plants  are  busy  making  long  chains  of  starches  and  glucose <comma> right <comma> out  of  co2 <period> he  's  found  a  way <comma> he  's  found  a  catalyst <comma> and  he  's  found  a  way  to  take  co2  and  make  it  into  polycarbonates <period> biodegradable  plastics  out  of  co2 <comma> how  plant-like <period> solar  transformations <comma> the  most  exciting  one <period> there  are  people  who  are  mimicking  the  energy-harvesting  device  inside  of  purple  bacterium <comma> the  people  at  asu <period> even  more  interesting <comma> lately <comma> in  the  last  couple  of  weeks <comma> people  have  seen  that  there  's  an  enzyme  called  hydrogenase  that  's  able  to  evolve  hydrogen  from  proton  and  electrons <comma> and  is  able  to  take  hydrogen  up <comma> basically  what  's  happening  in  a  fuel  cell <comma> in  the  anode  of  a  fuel  cell  and  in  a  reversible  fuel  cell <period> in  our  fuel  cells <comma> we  do  it  with  platinum <period> life  does  it  with  a  very <comma> very  common  iron <period> and  a  team  has  now  just  been  able  to  mimic  that  hydrogen-juggling  hydrogenase <period> that  's  very  exciting  for  fuel  cells <comma> to  be  able  to  do  that  without  platinum <period> power  of  shape <comma> here  's  a  whale <period> we've  seen  that  the  fins  of  this  whale  have  tubercles  on  them <period> and  those  little  bumps  actually  increase  efficiency  in <comma> for  instance <comma> the  edge  of  an  airplane <comma> increase  efficiency  by  about  32  percent <period> which  is  an  amazing  fossil  fuel  savings <comma> if  we  were  to  just  put  that  on  the  edge  of  a  wing <period> color  without  pigments <comma> this  peacock  is  creating  color  with  shape <period> light  comes  through <comma> it  bounces  back  off  the  layers <period> it  's  called  thin-film  interference <period> imagine  being  able  to  self-assemble  products  with  the  last  few  layers  playing  with  light  to  create  color <period> imagine  being  able  to  create  a  shape  on  the  outside  of  a  surface <comma> so  that  it  's  self-cleaning  with  just  water <period> that  's  what  a  leaf  does <period> see  that  up-close  picture <questionmark> that  's  a  ball  of  water <comma> and  those  are  dirt  particles <period> and  that  's  an  up-close  picture  of  a  lotus  leaf <period> there  's  a  company  making  a  product  called  lotusan <comma> which  mimics <comma> when  the  building  facade  paint  dries <comma> it  mimics  the  bumps  in  a  self-cleaning  leaf <comma> and  rainwater  cleans  the  building <period> water  is  going  to  be  our  big <comma> grand  challenge <comma> quenching  thirst <period> here  are  two  organisms  that  pull  water <period> the  one  on  the  left  is  the  namibian  beetle  pulling  water  out  of  fog <period> the  one  on  the  right  is  a  pill  bug <comma> pulls  water  out  of  air <period> does  not  drink  fresh  water <period> pulling  water  out  of  monterey  fog  and  out  of  the  sweaty  air  in  atlanta <comma> before  it  gets  into  a  building <comma> are  key  technologies <period> separation  technologies  are  going  to  be  extremely  important <period> what  if  we  were  to  say <comma> no  more  hard  rock  mining <questionmark> what  if  we  were  to  separate  out  metals  from  waste  streams <comma> small  amounts  of  metals  in  water <questionmark> that  's  what  microbes  do <period> they  chelate  metals  out  of  water <period> there  's  a  company  here  in  san  francisco  called  mr3  that  is  embedding  mimics  of  the  microbes  molecules  on  filters  to  mine  waste  streams <period> green  chemistry  is  chemistry  in  water <period> we  do  chemistry  in  organic  solvents <period> this  is  a  picture  of  the  spinnerets  coming  out  of  a  spider  and  the  silk  being  formed  from  a  spider <period> is  n't  that  beautiful <questionmark> green  chemistry  is  replacing  our  industrial  chemistry  with  nature  's  recipe  book <period> it  's  not  easy <comma> because  life  uses  only  a  subset  of  the  elements  in  the  periodic  table <period> and  we  use  all  of  them <comma> even  the  toxic  ones <period> to  figure  out  the  elegant  recipes  that  would  take  the  small  subset  of  the  periodic  table <comma> and  create  miracle  materials  like  that  cell <comma> is  the  task  of  green  chemistry <period> timed  degradation <comma> packaging  that  is  good  until  you  do  n't  want  it  to  be  good  anymore <comma> and  dissolves  on  cue <period> that  's  a  mussel  you  can  find  in  the  waters  out  here <period> and  the  threads  holding  it  to  a  rock  are  timed <period> at  exactly  two  years <comma> they  begin  to  dissolve <period> healing <comma> this  is  a  good  one <period> that  little  guy  over  there  is  a  tardigrade <period> there  is  a  problem  with  vaccines  around  the  world  not  getting  to  patients <period> and  the  reason  is  that  the  refrigeration  somehow  gets  broken <period> what  's  called  the  cold  chain  gets  broken <period> a  guy  named  bruce  rosner  looked  at  the  tardigrade <comma> which  dries  out  completely <comma> and  yet  stays  alive  for  months  and  months  and  months <comma> and  is  able  to  regenerate  itself <period> and  he  found  a  way  to  dry  out  vaccines <comma> encase  them  in  the  same  sort  of  sugar  capsules  as  the  tardigrade  has  within  its  cells <comma> meaning  that  vaccines  no  longer  need  to  be  refrigerated <period> they  can  be  put  in  a  glove  compartment <comma> ok <period> learning  from  organisms <period> this  is  a  session  about  water <comma> learning  about  organisms  that  can  do  without  water <comma> in  order  to  create  a  vaccine  that  lasts  and  lasts  and  lasts  without  refrigeration <period> i  'm  not  going  to  get  to  12 <period> but  what  i  am  going  to  do  is  tell  you  that  the  most  important  thing <comma> besides  all  of  these  adaptations <comma> is  the  fact  that  these  organisms  have  figured  out  a  way  to  do  the  amazing  things  they  do  while  taking  care  of  the  place  that  's  going  to  take  care  of  their  offspring <period> when  they  're  involved  in  foreplay <comma> they  're  thinking  about  something  very <comma> very  important <comma> and  that  's  having  their  genetic  material  remain <comma> 10,000  generations  from  now <period> and  that  means  finding  a  way  to  do  what  they  do  without  destroying  the  place  that  'll  take  care  of  their  offspring <period> that  's  the  biggest  design  challenge <period> luckily <comma> there  are  millions  and  millions  of  geniuses  willing  to  gift  us  with  their  best  ideas <period> good  luck  having  a  conversation  with  them <period> thank  you <period> chris  anderson <comma> talk  about  foreplay <comma> i <comma> we  need  to  get  to  12 <comma> but  really  quickly <period> janine  benyus <comma> oh  really <questionmark> ca <comma> yeah <period> just  like <comma> you  know <comma> like  the  10-second  version  of  10 <comma> 11  and  12 <period> because  we  just <comma> your  slides  are  so  gorgeous <comma> and  the  ideas  are  so  big <comma> i  cannot  stand  to  let  you  go  down  without  seeing  10 <comma> 11  and  12 <period> jb <comma> ok <comma> put  this <comma> ok <comma> i  'll  just  hold  this  thing <period> ok <comma> great <period> ok <comma> so  that  's  the  healing  one <period> sensing  and  responding <comma> feedback  is  a  huge  thing <period> this  is  a  locust <period> there  can  be  80  million  of  them  in  a  square  kilometer <comma> and  yet  they  do  n't  collide  with  one  another <period> and  yet  we  have  36  million  car  collisions  a  year <period> right <period> there  's  a  person  at  newcastle  who  has  figured  out  that  it  's  a  very  large  neuron <period> and  she  's  actually  figuring  out  how  to  make  a  collision-avoidance  circuitry  based  on  this  very  large  neuron  in  the  locust <period> this  is  a  huge  and  important  one <comma> number  11 <period> and  that  's  the  growing  fertility <period> that  means <comma> you  know <comma> net  fertility  farming <period> we  should  be  growing  fertility <period> and <comma> oh  yes <comma> we  get  food <comma> too <period> because  we  have  to  grow  the  capacity  of  this  planet  to  create  more  and  more  opportunities  for  life <period> and  really <comma> that  's  what  other  organisms  do  as  well <period> in  ensemble <comma> that  's  what  whole  ecosystems  do <comma> they  create  more  and  more  opportunities  for  life <period> our  farming  has  done  the  opposite <period> so <comma> farming  based  on  how  a  prairie  builds  soil <comma> ranching  based  on  how  a  native  ungulate  herd  actually  increases  the  health  of  the  range <period> even  wastewater  treatment  based  on  how  a  marsh  not  only  cleans  the  water <comma> but  creates  incredibly  sparkling  productivity <period> this  is  the  simple  design  brief <period> i  mean <comma> it  looks  simple  because  the  system <comma> over  38  billion  years <comma> has  worked  this  out <period> that  is <comma> those  organisms  that  have  not  been  able  to  figure  out  how  to  enhance  or  sweeten  their  places <comma> are  not  around  to  tell  us  about  it <period> that  's  the  twelfth  one <period> life <comma> and  this  is  the  secret  trick <period> this  is  the  magic  trick <comma> life  creates  conditions  conducive  to  life <period> it  builds  soil <period> it  cleans  air <period> it  cleans  water <period> it  mixes  the  cocktail  of  gases  that  you  and  i  need  to  live <period> and  it  does  that  in  the  middle  of  having  great  foreplay  and  meeting  their  needs <period> so  it  's  not  mutually  exclusive <period> we  have  to  find  a  way  to  meet  our  needs <comma> while  making  of  this  place  an  eden <period> ca <comma> janine <comma> thank  you  so  much <period> alright <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  couple  of  images  from  a  very  diverting  paper  in  the  journal  of  ultrasound  in  medicine <period> i  'm  going  to  go  way  out  on  a  limb  and  say  that  it  is  the  most  diverting  paper  ever  published  in  the  journal  of  ultrasound  in  medicine <period> the  title  is  observations  of  in-utero  masturbation <period> okay <period> now  on  the  left  you  can  see  the  hand <comma> that  's  the  big  arrow  -- <period> and  the  penis  on  the  right <period> the  hand  hovering <period> and  over  here  we  have <comma> in  the  words  of  radiologist  israel  meisner <comma> the  hand  grasping  the  penis  in  a  fashion  resembling  masturbation  movements <period> bear  in  mind  this  was  an  ultrasound <period> so  it  would  have  been  moving  images <period> orgasm  is  a  reflex  of  the  autonomic  nervous  system <period> now  this  is  the  part  of  the  nervous  system  that  deals  with  the  things  that  we  do  n't  consciously  control <period> like  digestion <comma> heart  rate  and  sexual  arousal <period> and  the  orgasm  reflex  can  be  triggered  by  a  surprisingly  broad  range  of  input <period> genital  stimulation <period> duh <period> but  also  kinsey  interviewed  a  woman  who  could  be  brought  to  orgasm  by  having  someone  stroke  her  eyebrow <period> people  with  spinal  cord  injuries <comma> like  paraplegias <comma> quadriplegias <comma> will  often  develop  a  very <comma> very  sensitive  area  right  above  the  level  of  their  injury <comma> wherever  that  is <period> there  is  such  a  thing  as  a  knee  orgasm  in  the  literature <period> i  think  the  most  curious  one  that  i  came  across  was  a  case  report  of  a  woman  who  had  an  orgasm  every  time  she  brushed  her  teeth <period> this  was  something  in  the  complex  sensory-motor  action  of  brushing  her  teeth  was  triggering  orgasm <period> and  she  went  to  a  neurologist  who  was  fascinated <period> he  checked  to  see  if  it  was  something  in  the  toothpaste <period> but  no <comma> it  happened  with  any  brand <period> they  stimulated  her  gums  with  a  toothpick <comma> to  see  if  that  was  doing  it <period> no <period> it  was  the  whole <comma> you  know <comma> motion <period> and  the  amazing  thing  to  me  is  that  now  you  would  think  this  woman  would  like  have  excellent  oral  hygiene <period> sadly  she <comma> this  is  what  it  said  in  the  journal  paper <comma> she  believed  that  she  was  possessed  by  demons  and  switched  to  mouthwash  for  her  oral  care <period> it  's  so  sad <period> i  interviewed <comma> when  i  was  working  on  the  book <comma> i  interviewed  a  woman  who  can  think  herself  to  orgasm <period> she  was  part  of  a  study  at  rutgers  university <period> you  gotta  love  that <period> rutgers <period> so  i  interviewed  her  in  oakland <comma> in  a  sushi  restaurant <period> and  i  said <comma> so <comma> could  you  do  it  right  here <questionmark> and  she  said <comma> yeah <comma> but  you  know  i'd  rather  finish  my  meal  if  you  do  n't  mind <period> but  afterwards  she  was  kind  enough  to  demonstrate  on  a  bench  outside <period> it  was  remarkable <period> it  took  about  one  minute <period> and  i  said  to  her <comma> are  you  just  doing  this  all  the  time <questionmark> she  said <comma> no <period> honestly  when  i  get  home  i  'm  usually  too  tired <period> she  said  that  the  last  time  she  had  done  it  was  on  the  disneyland  tram <period> the  headquarters  for  orgasm <comma> along  the  spinal  nerve <comma> is  something  called  the  sacral  nerve  root <comma> which  is  back  here <period> and  if  you  trigger <comma> if  you  stimulate  with  an  electrode <comma> the  precise  spot <comma> you  will  trigger  an  orgasm <period> and  it  is  a  fact  that  you  can  trigger  spinal  reflexes  in  dead  people  -- <period> a  certain  kind  of  dead  person <comma> a  beating-heart  cadaver <period> now  this  is  somebody  who  is  brain-dead <comma> legally  dead <comma> definitely  checked  out <comma> but  is  being  kept  alive  on  a  respirator <comma> so  that  their  organs  will  be  oxygenated  for  transplantation <period> now  in  one  of  these  brain-dead  people <comma> if  you  trigger  the  right  spot <comma> you  will  see  something  every  now  and  then <period> there  is  a  reflex  called  the  lazarus  reflex <period> and  this  is <comma> i  'll  demonstrate  as  best  i  can <comma> not  being  dead <period> it  's  like  this <period> you  trigger  the  spot <period> the  dead  guy <comma> or  gal <comma> goes <period> like  that <period> very  unsettling  for  people  working  in  pathology  labs <period> now  if  you  can  trigger  the  lazarus  reflex  in  a  dead  person <comma> why  not  the  orgasm  reflex <questionmark> i  asked  this  question  to  a  brain  death  expert <comma> stephanie  mann <comma> who  was  foolish  enough  to  return  my  emails <period> i  said <comma> so <comma> could  you  conceivably  trigger  an  orgasm  in  a  dead  person <questionmark> she  said <comma> yes <comma> if  the  sacral  nerve  is  being  oxygenated <period> you  conceivably  could <period> obviously  it  would  n't  be  as  much  fun  for  the  person <period> but  it  would  be  an  orgasm  -- <period> nonetheless <period> i  actually  suggested  to <comma> there  is  a  researcher  at  the  university  of  alabama  who  does  orgasm  research <period> i  said  to  her <comma> you  should  do  an  experiment <period> you  know <questionmark> you  can  get  cadavers  if  you  work  at  a  university <period> i  said <comma> you  should  actually  do  this <period> she  said <comma> you  get  the  human  subjects  review  board  approval  for  this  one <period> according  to  1930s  marriage  manual  author <comma> theodoor  van  de  velde <comma> a  slight  seminal  odor  can  be  detected  on  the  breath  of  a  woman  within  about  an  hour  after  sexual  intercourse <period> theodoor  van  de  velde  was  something  of  a  semen  connoisseur <period> this  is  a  guy  writing  a  book <comma> ideal  marriage <comma> you  know <period> very  heavy  hetero  guy <period> but  he  wrote  in  this  book <comma> ideal  marriage <comma> he  said  that  he  could  differentiate  between  the  semen  of  a  young  man <comma> which  he  said  had  a  fresh <comma> exhilarating  smell <comma> and  the  semen  of  mature  men <comma> whose  semen  smelled  quote <comma> remarkably  like  that  of  the  flowers  of  the  spanish  chestnut <period> sometimes  quite  freshly  floral <comma> and  then  again  sometimes  extremely  pungent <period> okay <period> in  1999 <comma> in  the  state  of  israel <comma> a  man  began  hiccupping <period> and  this  was  one  of  those  cases  that  went  on  and  on <period> he  tried  everything  his  friends  suggested <period> nothing  seemed  to  help <period> days  went  by <period> at  a  certain  point <comma> the  man <comma> still  hiccupping <comma> had  sex  with  his  wife <period> and  lo  and  behold <comma> the  hiccups  went  away <period> he  told  his  doctor <comma> who  published  a  case  report  in  a  canadian  medical  journal  under  the  title <comma> sexual  intercourse  as  a  potential  treatment  for  intractable  hiccups <period> i  love  this  article  because  at  a  certain  point  they  suggested  that  unattached  hiccuppers  could  try  masturbation <period> i  love  that  because  there  is  like  a  whole  demographic <comma> unattached  hiccuppers <period> married <comma> single <comma> unattached  hiccupper <period> in  the  1900s <comma> early  1900s  gynecologists <comma> a  lot  of  gynecologists  believed  that  when  a  woman  has  an  orgasm  the  contractions  serve  to  suck  the  semen  up  through  the  cervix  and  sort  of  deliver  it  really  quickly  to  the  egg <period> thereby  upping  the  odds  of  conception <period> it  was  called  the  upsuck  theory <period> if  you  go  all  the  way  back  to  hippocrates <comma> physicians  believed  that  orgasm  in  women  was  not  just  helpful  for  conception <comma> but  necessary <period> doctors  back  then  were  routinely  telling  men  the  importance  of  pleasuring  their  wives <period> marriage-manual  author  and  semen-sniffer  theodoor  van  de  velde  -- <period> has  a  line  in  his  book <period> i  loved  this  guy <period> i  got  a  lot  of  mileage  out  of  theodoor  van  de  velde <period> he  had  this  line  in  his  book  that  supposedly  comes  from  the  habsburg  monarchy <period> where  there  was  an  empress  maria  theresa <comma> who  was  having  trouble  conceiving <period> and  apparently  the  royal  court  physician  said  to  her <comma> i  am  of  the  opinion  that  the  vulva  of  your  most  sacred  majesty  be  titillated  for  some  time  prior  to  intercourse <period> it  's  apparently <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> on  the  record  somewhere <period> masters  and  johnson <comma> now  we  're  moving  forward  to  the  1950s <period> masters  and  johnson  were  upsuck  skeptics <comma> which  is  also  really  fun  to  say <period> they  did  n't  buy  it <period> and  they  decided <comma> being  masters  and  johnson <comma> that  they  would  get  to  the  bottom  of  it <period> they  brought  women  into  the  lab <comma> i  think  it  was  five  women  -- <period> and  outfitted  them  with  cervical  caps  containing  artificial  semen <period> and  in  the  artificial  semen  was  a  radio-opaque  substance <comma> such  that  it  would  show  up  on  an  x-ray <period> this  is  the  1950s <period> anyway  these  women  sat  in  front  of  an  x-ray  device <period> and  they  masturbated <period> and  masters  and  johnson  looked  to  see  if  the  semen  was  being  sucked  up <period> did  not  find  any  evidence  of  upsuck <period> you  may  be  wondering <comma> how  do  you  make  artificial  semen <questionmark> i  have  an  answer  for  you <period> i  have  two  answers <period> you  can  use  flour  and  water <comma> or  cornstarch  and  water <period> i  actually  found  three  separate  recipes  in  the  literature <period> my  favorite  being  the  one  that  says  -- <period> you  know <comma> they  have  the  ingredients  listed <comma> and  then  in  a  recipe  it  will  say <comma> for  example <comma> yield <comma> two  dozen  cupcakes <period> this  one  said <comma> yield <comma> one  ejaculate <period> there  's  another  way  that  orgasm  might  boost  fertility <period> this  one  involves  men <period> sperm  that  sit  around  in  the  body  for  a  week  or  more  start  to  develop  abnormalities  that  make  them  less  effective  at  head-banging  their  way  into  the  egg <period> british  sexologist  roy  levin  has  speculated  that  this  is  perhaps  why  men  evolved  to  be  such  enthusiastic  and  frequent  masturbators <period> he  said <comma> if  i  keep  tossing  myself  off  i  get  fresh  sperm  being  made <period> which  i  thought  was  an  interesting  idea <comma> theory <period> so  now  you  have  an  evolutionary  excuse <period> okay <period> alrighty <period> there  is  considerable  evidence  for  upsuck  in  the  animal  kingdom  -- <period> pigs <comma> for  instance <period> in  denmark <comma> the  danish  national  committee  for  pig  production  found  out  that  if  you  sexually  stimulate  a  sow  while  you  artificially  inseminate  her <comma> you  will  see  a  six-percent  increase  in  the  farrowing  rate <comma> which  is  the  number  of  piglets  produced <period> so  they  came  up  with  this  plan <comma> this  five-point  stimulation  plan  for  the  sows <period> and  they  had  the  farmers <comma> there  is  posters  they  put  in  the  barn <comma> and  they  have  a  dvd <period> and  i  got  a  copy  of  this  dvd <period> this  is  my  unveiling <comma> because  i  am  going  to  show  you  a  clip <period> so  uh <comma> okay <period> now  here  we  go  in  to  the <comma> la  la  la <comma> off  to  work <period> it  all  looks  very  innocent <period> he  's  going  to  be  doing  things  with  his  hands  that  the  boar  would  use  his  snout <comma> lacking  hands <period> okay <period> this  is  it <period> the  boar  has  a  very  odd  courtship  repertoire <period> this  is  to  mimic  the  weight  of  the  boar <period> you  should  know <comma> the  clitoris  of  the  pig <comma> inside  the  vagina <period> so  this  may  be  sort  of  titillating  for  her <period> here  we  go <period> and  the  happy  result <period> i  love  this  video <period> there  is  a  point  in  this  video <comma> towards  the  beginning  where  they  zoom  in  for  a  close  up  of  his  hand  with  his  wedding  ring <comma> as  if  to  say <comma> it  's  okay <comma> it  's  just  his  job <period> he  really  does  like  women <period> okay <period> now  i  said <comma> when  i  was  in  denmark <comma> my  host  was  named  anne  marie <period> and  i  said <comma> so  why  do  n't  you  just  stimulate  the  clitoris  of  the  pig <questionmark> why  do  n't  you  have  the  farmers  do  that <questionmark> that  's  not  one  of  your  five  steps <period> she  said <comma> i  have  to  read  you  what  she  said <comma> because  i  love  it <period> she  said <comma> it  was  a  big  hurdle  just  to  get  farmers  to  touch  underneath  the  vulva <period> so  we  thought <comma> let  's  not  mention  the  clitoris  right  now <period> shy  but  ambitious  pig  farmers <comma> however <comma> can  purchase  a <comma> this  is  true <comma> a  sow  vibrator <comma> that  hangs  on  the  sperm  feeder  tube  to  vibrate <period> because <comma> as  i  mentioned <comma> the  clitoris  is  inside  the  vagina <period> so  possibly <comma> you  know <comma> a  little  more  arousing  than  it  looks <period> and  i  also  said  to  her <comma> now  these  sows <period> i  mean <comma> you  may  have  noticed  there <comma> the  sow  does  n't  look  to  be  in  the  throes  of  ecstasy <period> and  she  said <comma> you  cannot  make  that  conclusion <period> because  animals  do  n't  register  pain  or  pleasure  on  their  faces  in  the  same  way  that  we  do <period> they  tend  to <comma> pigs <comma> for  example <comma> are  more  like  dogs <period> they  use  the  upper  half  of  the  face <period> the  ears  are  very  expressive <period> so  you  're  not  really  sure  what  's  going  on  with  the  pig <period> primates <comma> on  the  other  hand <comma> we  use  our  mouths  more <period> this  is  the  ejaculation  face  of  the  stump-tailed  macaque <period> and <comma> interestingly <comma> this  has  been  observed  in  female  macaques <period> but  only  when  mounting  another  female <period> masters  and  johnson <comma> in  the  1950s <comma> they  decided <comma> okay <comma> we  're  going  to  figure  out  the  entire  human  sexual  response  cycle <period> from  arousal <comma> all  the  way  through  orgasm <comma> in  men  and  women  -- <period> everything  that  happens  in  the  human  body <period> okay <comma> with  women <comma> a  lot  of  this  is  happening  inside <period> this  did  not  stop  masters  and  johnson <period> they  developed  an  artificial  coition  machine <period> this  is  basically  a  penis  camera  on  a  motor <period> there  is  a  phallus <comma> clear  acrylic  phallus <comma> with  a  camera  and  a  light  source <comma> attached  to  a  motor  that  is  kind  of  going  like  this <period> and  the  woman  would  have  sex  with  it <period> that  is  what  they  would  do <period> pretty  amazing <period> sadly <comma> this  device  has  been  dismantled <period> this  just  kills  me <comma> not  because  i  wanted  to  use  it  -- <period> i  wanted  to  see  it <period> one  fine  day  alfred  kinsey  decided  to  calculate  the  average  distance  traveled  by  ejaculated  semen <period> this  was  not  idle  curiosity <period> doctor  kinsey  had  heard <comma> and  there  was  a  theory  kind  of  going  around  at  the  time <comma> this  being  the  1940s <comma> that  the  force  with  which  semen  is  thrown  against  the  cervix  was  a  factor  in  fertility <period> kinsey  thought  it  was  bunk <comma> so  he  got  to  work <period> he  got  together  in  his  lab  300  men <comma> a  measuring  tape <comma> and  a  movie  camera <period> and  in  fact  he  found  that  in  three  quarters  of  the  men  the  stuff  just  kind  of  slopped  out <period> it  was  n't  spurted  or  thrown  or  ejected  under  great  force <period> however <comma> the  record  holder  landed  just  shy  of  the  eight-foot  mark <comma> which  is  impressive <period> yes <period> exactly <period> sadly <comma> he  's  anonymous <period> his  name  is  not  mentioned <period> in  his  write-up <comma> in  his  write-up  of  this  experiment  in  his  book <comma> kinsey  wrote <comma> two  sheets  were  laid  down  to  protect  the  oriental  carpets <period> which  is  my  second  favorite  line  in  the  entire  oeuvre  of  alfred  kinsey <period> my  favorite  being <comma> cheese  crumbs  spread  before  a  pair  of  copulating  rats  will  distract  the  female <comma> but  not  the  male <period> thank  you  very  much <period> thanks <period> you've  all  seen  lots  of  articles  on  climate  change <comma> and  here  's  yet  another  new  york  times  article <comma> just  like  every  other  darn  one  you've  seen <period> it  says  all  the  same  stuff  as  all  the  other  ones  you've  seen <period> it  even  has  the  same  amount  of  headline  as  all  the  other  ones  you've  seen <period> what  's  unusual  about  this  one <comma> maybe <comma> is  that  it  's  from  1953 <period> and  the  reason  i  'm  saying  this  is  that  you  may  have  the  idea  this  problem  is  relatively  recent <period> that  people  have  just  sort  of  figured  out  about  it <comma> and  now  with  kyoto  and  the  governator  and  people  beginning  to  actually  do  something <comma> we  may  be  on  the  road  to  a  solution <period> the  fact  is <comma> uh-uh <period> we've  known  about  this  problem  for  50  years <comma> depending  on  how  you  count  it <period> we  have  talked  about  it  endlessly  over  the  last  decade  or  so <period> and  we've  accomplished  close  to  zip <period> this  is  the  growth  rate  of  co2  in  the  atmosphere <period> you've  seen  this  in  various  forms <comma> but  maybe  you  have  n't  seen  this  one <period> what  this  shows  is  that  the  rate  of  growth  of  our  emissions  is  accelerating <period> and  that  it  's  accelerating  even  faster  than  what  we  thought  was  the  worst  case  just  a  few  years  back <period> so  that  red  line  there  was  something  that  a  lot  of  skeptics  said  the  environmentalists  only  put  in  the  projections  to  make  the  projections  look  as  bad  as  possible <period> that  emissions  would  never  grow  as  fast  as  that  red  line <period> but  in  fact <comma> they  're  growing  faster <period> here  's  some  data  from  actually  just  10  days  ago <comma> which  shows  this  year  's  minimum  of  the  arctic  sea  ice <comma> and  it  's  the  lowest  by  far <period> and  the  rate  at  which  the  arctic  sea  ice  is  going  away  is  a  lot  quicker  than  models <period> so  despite  all  sorts  of  experts  like  me  flying  around  the  planet  and  burning  jet  fuel <comma> and  politicians  signing  treaties <comma> in  fact <comma> you  could  argue  the  net  effect  of  all  this  has  been  negative <comma> because  it  's  just  consumed  a  lot  of  jet  fuel <period> no <comma> no <period> in  terms  of  what  we  really  need  to  do  to  put  the  brakes  on  this  very  high  inertial  thing <comma> our  big  economy <comma> we've  really  hardly  started <period> really <comma> we  're  doing  this <comma> basically <period> really <comma> not  very  much <period> i  do  n't  want  to  depress  you  too  much <period> the  problem  is  absolutely  soluble <comma> and  even  soluble  in  a  way  that  's  reasonably  cheap <period> cheap  meaning  sort  of  the  cost  of  the  military <comma> not  the  cost  of  medical  care <period> cheap  meaning  a  few  percent  of  gdp <period> no <comma> this  is  really  important  to  have  this  sense  of  scale <period> so  the  problem  is  soluble <comma> and  the  way  we  should  go  about  solving  it  is <comma> say <comma> dealing  with  electricity  production <comma> which  causes  something  like  43-or-so  percent  and  rising  of  co2  emissions <period> and  we  could  do  that  by  perfectly  sensible  things  like  conservation <comma> and  wind  power <comma> nuclear  power  and  coal  to  co2  capture <comma> which  are  all  things  that  are  ready  for  giant  scale  deployment <comma> and  work <period> all  we  lack  is  the  action  to  actually  spend  the  money  to  put  those  into  place <period> instead <comma> we  spend  our  time  talking <period> but  nevertheless <comma> that  's  not  what  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  tonight <period> what  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  tonight  is  stuff  we  might  do  if  we  did  nothing <period> and  it  's  this  stuff  in  the  middle  here <comma> which  is  what  you  do  if  you  do  n't  stop  the  emissions  quickly  enough <period> and  you  need  to  deal <comma> somehow  break  the  link  between  human  actions  that  change  climate <comma> and  the  climate  change  itself <period> and  that  's  particularly  important  because <comma> of  course <comma> while  we  can  adapt  to  climate  change <comma> and  it  's  important  to  be  honest  here <comma> there  will  be  some  benefits  to  climate  change <period> oh <comma> yes <comma> i  think  it  's  bad <period> i've  spent  my  whole  life  working  to  stop  it <period> but  one  of  the  reasons  it  's  politically  hard  is  there  are  winners  and  losers <comma> not  all  losers <period> but <comma> of  course <comma> the  natural  world <comma> polar  bears <period> i  spent  time  skiing  across  the  sea  ice  for  weeks  at  a  time  in  the  high  arctic <period> they  will  completely  lose <period> and  there  's  no  adaption <period> so  this  problem  is  absolutely  soluble <period> this  geo-engineering  idea <comma> in  it  's  simplest  form <comma> is  basically  the  following <period> you  could  put  signed  particles <comma> say  sulfuric  acid  particles <comma> sulfates <comma> into  the  upper  atmosphere <comma> the  stratosphere <comma> where  they'd  reflect  away  sunlight  and  cool  the  planet <period> and  i  know  for  certain  that  that  will  work <period> not  that  there  are  n't  side  effects <comma> but  i  know  for  certain  it  will  work <period> and  the  reason  is <comma> it  's  been  done <period> and  it  was  done  not  by  us <comma> not  by  me <comma> but  by  nature <period> here  's  mount  pinatubo  in  the  early  90s <period> that  put  a  whole  bunch  of  sulfur  in  the  stratosphere  with  a  sort  of  atomic  bomb-like  cloud <period> the  result  of  that  was  pretty  dramatic <period> after  that <comma> and  some  previous  volcanoes  we  have <comma> you  see  a  quite  dramatic  cooling  of  the  atmosphere <period> so  this  lower  bar  is  the  upper  atmosphere <comma> the  stratosphere <comma> and  it  heats  up  after  these  volcanoes <period> but  you  'll  notice  that  in  the  upper  bar <comma> which  is  the  lower  atmosphere  and  the  surface <comma> it  cools  down  because  we  shielded  the  atmosphere  a  little  bit <period> there  's  no  big  mystery  about  it <period> there  's  lots  of  mystery  in  the  details <comma> and  there  's  some  bad  side  effects <comma> like  it  partially  destroys  the  ozone  layer <comma> and  i  'll  get  to  that  in  a  minute <period> but  it  clearly  cools  down <period> and  one  other  thing <comma> it  's  fast <period> it  's  really  important  to  say <period> so  much  of  the  other  things  that  we  ought  to  do <comma> like  slowing  emissions <comma> are  intrinsically  slow <comma> because  it  takes  time  to  build  all  the  hardware  we  need  to  reduce  emissions <period> and  not  only  that <comma> when  you  cut  emissions <comma> you  do  n't  cut  concentrations <period> because  concentrations <comma> the  amount  of  co2  in  the  air <comma> is  the  sum  of  emissions  over  time <period> so  you  cannot  step  on  the  brakes  very  quickly <period> but  if  you  do  this <comma> it  's  quick <period> and  there  are  times  you  might  like  to  do  something  quick <period> another  thing  you  might  wonder  about  is <comma> does  it  work <questionmark> can  you  shade  some  sunlight  and  effectively  compensate  for  the  added  co2 <comma> and  produce  a  climate  sort  of  back  to  what  it  was  originally <questionmark> and  the  answer  seems  to  be  yes <period> so  here  are  the  graphs  you've  seen  lots  of  times  before <period> that  's  what  the  world  looks  like <comma> under  one  particular  climate  model  's  view <comma> with  twice  the  amount  of  co2  in  the  air <period> the  lower  graph  is  with  twice  the  amount  of  co2  and  18  percent  less  sunlight <comma> and  you  're  back  to  the  original  climate <period> and  this  graph  from  ken  caldeira <period> it  's  important  to  say  came <comma> because  ken <comma> at  a  meeting  that  i  believe  marty  hoffart  was  also  at  in  the  mid-'90s <comma> ken  and  i  stood  up  at  the  back  of  the  meeting  and  said <comma> geo-engineering  wo  n't  work <period> and  to  the  person  who  was  promoting  it  said <comma> the  atmosphere  's  much  more  complicated <period> gave  a  bunch  of  physical  reasons  why  it  would  n't  do  a  very  good  compensation <period> ken  went  and  ran  his  models <comma> and  found  that  it  did <period> this  topic  is  also  old <period> that  report  that  landed  on  president  johnson  's  desk  when  i  was  two  years  old  -- <period> 1965 <period> that  report <comma> in  fact <comma> which  had  all  the  modern  climate  science <comma> the  only  thing  they  talked  about  doing  was  geo-engineering <period> it  did  n't  even  talk  about  cutting  emissions <comma> which  is  an  incredible  shift  in  our  thinking  about  this  problem <period> i  'm  not  saying  we  should  n't  cut  emissions <period> we  should <comma> but  it  made  exactly  this  point <period> so <comma> in  a  sense <comma> there  's  not  much  new <period> the  one  new  thing  is  this  essay <period> so  i  should  say <comma> i  guess <comma> that  since  the  time  of  that  original  president  johnson  report <comma> and  the  various  reports  of  the  us <period> national  academy <comma> 1977 <comma> 1982 <comma> 1990 <comma> people  always  talked  about  this  idea <period> not  as  something  that  was  foolproof <comma> but  as  an  idea  to  think  about <period> but  when  climate  became <comma> politically <comma> a  hot  topic <comma> if  i  may  make  the  pun <comma> in  the  last  15  years <comma> this  became  so  un-pc <comma> we  could  n't  talk  about  it <period> it  just  sunk  below  the  surface <period> we  were  n't  allowed  to  speak  about  it <period> but  in  the  last  year <comma> paul  crutzen  published  this  essay  saying  roughly  what  's  all  been  said  before <comma> that  maybe <comma> given  our  very  slow  rate  of  progress  in  solving  this  problem  and  the  uncertain  impacts <comma> we  should  think  about  things  like  this <period> he  said  roughly  what  's  been  said  before <period> the  big  deal  was  he  happened  to  have  won  the  nobel  prize  for  ozone  chemistry <period> and  so  people  took  him  seriously  when  he  said  we  should  think  about  this <comma> even  though  there  will  be  some  ozone  impacts <period> and  in  fact <comma> he  had  some  ideas  to  make  them  go  away <period> there  was  all  sorts  of  press  coverage <comma> all  over  the  world <comma> going  right  down  to  dr.  strangelove  saves  the  earth <comma> from  the  economist <period> and  that  got  me  thinking <period> i've  worked  on  this  topic  on  and  off <comma> but  not  so  much  technically <period> and  i  was  actually  lying  in  bed  thinking  one  night <period> and  i  thought  about  this  child  's  toy <comma> hence <comma> the  title  of  my  talk <comma> and  i  wondered  if  you  could  use  the  same  physics  that  makes  that  thing  spin  round  in  the  child  's  radiometer <comma> to  levitate  particles  into  the  upper  atmosphere  and  make  them  stay  there <period> one  of  the  problems  with  sulfates  is  they  fall  out  quickly <period> the  other  problem  is  they  're  right  in  the  ozone  layer <comma> and  i'd  prefer  them  above  the  ozone  layer <period> and  it  turns  out <comma> i  woke  up  the  next  morning <comma> and  i  started  to  calculate  this <period> it  was  very  hard  to  calculate  from  first  principles <period> i  was  stumped <period> but  then  i  found  out  that  there  were  all  sorts  of  papers  already  published  that  addressed  this  topic  because  it  happens  already  in  the  natural  atmosphere <period> so  it  seems  there  are  already  fine  particles  that  are  levitated  up  to  what  we  call  the  mesosphere <comma> about  100  kilometers  up <comma> that  already  have  this  effect <period> i  'll  tell  you  very  quickly  how  the  effect  works <period> there  are  a  lot  of  fun  complexities  that  i'd  love  to  spend  the  whole  evening  on <comma> but  i  wo  n't <period> but  let  's  say  you  have  sunlight  hitting  some  particle  and  it  's  unevenly  heated <period> so  the  side  facing  the  sun  is  warmer <period> the  side  away <comma> cooler <period> gas  molecules  that  bounce  off  the  warm  side  bounce  away  with  some  extra  velocity  because  it  's  warm <period> and  so  you  see  a  net  force  away  from  the  sun <period> that  's  called  the  photophoretic  force <period> there  are  a  bunch  of  other  versions  of  it  that  i  and  some  collaborators  have  thought  about  how  to  exploit <period> and  of  course <comma> we  may  be  wrong <comma> this  has  n't  all  been  peer  reviewed <comma> we  're  in  the  middle  of  thinking  about  it <comma> but  so  far <comma> it  seems  good <period> but  it  looks  like  we  could  achieve  long  atmospheric  lifetimes <comma> much  longer  than  before <comma> because  they  're  levitated <period> we  can  move  things  out  of  the  stratosphere  into  the  mesosphere <comma> in  principle  solving  the  ozone  problem <period> i  'm  sure  there  will  be  other  problems  that  arise <period> finally <comma> we  could  make  the  particles  migrate  to  over  the  poles <comma> so  we  could  arrange  the  climate  engineering  so  it  really  focused  on  the  poles <period> which  would  have  minimal  bad  impacts  in  the  middle  of  the  planet <comma> where  we  live <comma> and  do  the  maximum  job  of  what  we  might  need  to  do <comma> which  is  cooling  the  poles  in  case  of  planetary  emergency <comma> if  you  like <period> this  is  a  new  idea  that  's  crept  up  that  may  be <comma> essentially <comma> a  cleverer  idea  than  putting  sulfates  in <period> whether  this  idea  is  right  or  some  other  idea  is  right <comma> i  think  it  's  almost  certain  we  will  eventually  think  of  cleverer  things  to  do  than  just  putting  sulfur  in <period> that  if  engineers  and  scientists  really  turned  their  minds  to  this <comma> it  's  amazing  how  we  can  affect  the  planet <period> the  one  thing  about  this  is  it  gives  us  extraordinary  leverage <period> this  improved  science  and  engineering  will <comma> whether  we  like  it  or  not <comma> give  us  more  and  more  leverage  to  affect  the  planet <period> to  control  the  planet <period> to  give  us  weather  and  climate  control <comma> not  because  we  plan  it <comma> not  because  we  want  it <comma> just  because  science  delivers  it  to  us  bit  by  bit <comma> with  better  knowledge  of  the  way  the  system  works  and  better  engineering  tools  to  effect  it <period> now <comma> suppose  that  space  aliens  arrived <period> maybe  they  're  going  to  land  at  the  un <period> headquarters  down  the  road  here <comma> or  maybe  they  'll  pick  a  smarter  spot <comma> but  suppose  they  arrive  and  they  give  you  a  box <period> and  the  box  has  two  knobs <period> one  knob  is  the  knob  for  controlling  global  temperature <period> maybe  another  knob  is  a  knob  for  controlling  co2  concentrations <period> you  might  imagine  that  we  would  fight  wars  over  that  box <period> because  we  have  no  way  to  agree  about  where  to  set  the  knobs <period> we  have  no  global  governance <period> and  different  people  will  have  different  places  they  want  it  set <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  think  that  's  going  to  happen <period> it  's  not  very  likely <period> but  we  're  building  that  box <period> the  scientists  and  engineers  of  the  world  are  building  it  piece  by  piece <comma> in  their  labs <period> even  when  they  're  doing  it  for  other  reasons <period> even  when  they  're  thinking  they  're  just  working  on  protecting  the  environment <period> they  have  no  interest  in  crazy  ideas  like  engineering  the  whole  planet <period> they  develop  science  that  makes  it  easier  and  easier  to  do <period> and  so  i  guess  my  view  on  this  is  not  that  i  want  to  do  it <comma> i  do  not <comma> but  that  we  should  move  this  out  of  the  shadows  and  talk  about  it  seriously <period> because  sooner  or  later <comma> we  'll  be  confronted  with  decisions  about  this <comma> and  it  's  better  if  we  think  hard  about  it <comma> even  if  we  want  to  think  hard  about  reasons  why  we  should  never  do  it <period> i  'll  give  you  two  different  ways  to  think  about  this  problem  that  are  the  beginning  of  my  thinking  about  how  to  think  about  it <period> but  what  we  need  is  not  just  a  few  oddballs  like  me  thinking  about  this <period> we  need  a  broader  debate <period> a  debate  that  involves  musicians <comma> scientists <comma> philosophers <comma> writers <comma> who  get  engaged  with  this  question  about  climate  engineering  and  think  seriously  about  what  its  implications  are <period> so  here  's  one  way  to  think  about  it <comma> which  is  that  we  just  do  this  instead  of  cutting  emissions  because  it  's  cheaper <period> i  guess  the  thing  i  have  n't  said  about  this  is <comma> it  is  absurdly  cheap <period> it  's  conceivable  that <comma> say <comma> using  the  sulfates  method  or  this  method  i've  come  up  with <comma> you  could  create  an  ice  age  at  a  cost  of  001  percent  of  gdp <period> it  's  very  cheap <period> we  have  a  lot  of  leverage <period> it  's  not  a  good  idea <comma> but  it  's  just  important <period> i  'll  tell  you  how  big  the  lever  is <comma> the  lever  is  that  big <period> and  that  calculation  is  n't  much  in  dispute <period> you  might  argue  about  the  sanity  of  it <comma> but  the  leverage  is  real <period> so  because  of  this <comma> we  could  deal  with  the  problem  simply  by  stopping  reducing  emissions <period> and  just  as  the  concentrations  go  up <comma> we  can  increase  the  amount  of  geo-engineering <period> i  do  n't  think  anybody  takes  that  seriously <period> because  under  this  scenario <comma> we  walk  further  and  further  away  from  the  current  climate <period> we  have  all  sorts  of  other  problems <comma> like  ocean  acidification  that  come  from  co2  in  the  atmosphere <comma> anyway <period> nobody  but  maybe  one  or  two  very  odd  folks  really  suggest  this <period> but  here  's  a  case  which  is  harder  to  reject <period> let  's  say  that  we  do  n't  do  geo-engineering <comma> we  do  what  we  ought  to  do <comma> which  is  get  serious  about  cutting  emissions <period> but  we  do  n't  really  know  how  quickly  we  have  to  cut  them <period> there  's  a  lot  of  uncertainty  about  exactly  how  much  climate  change  is  too  much <period> so  let  's  say  that  we  work  hard <comma> and  we  actually  do  n't  just  tap  the  brakes <comma> but  we  step  hard  on  the  brakes  and  really  reduce  emissions  and  eventually  reduce  concentrations <period> and  maybe  someday <comma> like  2075 <comma> october  23 <comma> we  finally  reach  that  glorious  day  where  concentrations  have  peaked  and  are  rolling  down  the  other  side <period> and  we  have  global  celebrations <comma> and  we've  actually  started  to <comma> you  know <comma> we've  seen  the  worst  of  it <period> but  maybe  on  that  day  we  also  find  that  the  greenland  ice  sheet  is  really  melting  unacceptably  fast <comma> fast  enough  to  put  meters  of  sea  level  on  the  oceans  in  the  next  100  years <comma> and  remove  some  of  the  biggest  cities  from  the  map <period> that  's  an  absolutely  possible  scenario <period> we  might  decide  at  that  point  that  even  though  geo-engineering  was  uncertain  and  morally  unhappy <comma> that  it  's  a  lot  better  than  not  geo-engineering <period> and  that  's  a  very  different  way  to  look  at  the  problem <period> it  's  using  this  as  risk  control <comma> not  instead  of  action <period> it  's  saying  that  you  do  some  geo-engineering  for  a  little  while  to  take  the  worst  of  the  heat  off <comma> not  that  you'd  use  it  as  a  substitute  for  action <period> but  there  is  a  problem  with  that  view <period> and  the  problem  is  the  following <comma> knowledge  that  geo-engineering  is  possible  makes  the  climate  impacts  look  less  fearsome <period> and  that  makes  a  weaker  commitment  to  cutting  emissions  today <period> this  is  what  economists  call  a  moral  hazard <period> and  that  's  one  of  the  fundamental  reasons  that  this  problem  is  so  hard  to  talk  about <comma> and <comma> in  general <comma> i  think  it  's  the  underlying  reason  that  it  's  been  politically  unacceptable  to  talk  about  this <period> but  you  do  n't  make  good  policy  by  hiding  things  in  a  drawer <period> i  'll  leave  you  with  three  questions <comma> and  then  one  final  quote <period> should  we  do  serious  research  on  this  topic <questionmark> should  we  have  a  national  research  program  that  looks  at  this <questionmark> not  just  at  how  you  would  do  it  better <comma> but  also  what  all  the  risks  and  downsides  of  it  are <period> right  now <comma> you  have  a  few  enthusiasts  talking  about  it <comma> some  in  a  positive  side <comma> some  in  a  negative  side <comma> but  that  's  a  dangerous  state  to  be  in  because  there  's  very  little  depth  of  knowledge  on  this  topic <period> a  very  small  amount  of  money  would  get  us  some <period> many  of  us <comma> maybe  now  me <comma> think  we  should  do  that <period> but  i  have  a  lot  of  reservations <period> my  reservations  are  principally  about  the  moral  hazard  problem <comma> and  i  do  n't  really  know  how  we  can  best  avoid  the  moral  hazard <period> i  think  there  is  a  serious  problem <comma> as  you  talk  about  this <period> people  begin  to  think  they  do  n't  need  to  work  so  hard  to  cut  emissions <period> another  thing  is <comma> maybe  we  need  a  treaty <period> a  treaty  that  decides  who  gets  to  do  this <period> right  now  we  may  think  of  a  big <comma> rich  country  like  the  us <period> doing  this <period> but  it  might  well  be  that <comma> in  fact <comma> if  china  wakes  up  in  2030  and  realizes  that  the  climate  impacts  are  just  unacceptable <comma> they  may  not  be  very  interested  in  our  moral  conversations  about  how  to  do  this <comma> and  they  may  just  decide  they'd  really  rather  have  a  geo-engineered  world  than  a  non-geo-engineered  world <period> and  we  'll  have  no  international  mechanism  to  figure  out  who  makes  the  decision <period> so  here  's  one  last  thought <comma> which  was  said  much <comma> much  better  25  years  ago  in  the  us <period> national  academy  report  than  i  can  say  today <period> and  i  think  it  really  summarizes  where  we  are  here <period> that  the  co2  problem <comma> the  climate  problem  that  we've  heard  about <comma> is  driving  lots  of  things <comma> innovations  in  the  energy  technologies  that  will  reduce  emissions  -- <period> but  also <comma> i  think <comma> inevitably <comma> it  will  drive  us  towards  thinking  about  climate  and  weather  control <comma> whether  we  like  it  or  not <period> and  it  's  time  to  begin  thinking  about  it <comma> even  if  the  reason  we  're  thinking  about  it  is  to  construct  arguments  for  why  we  should  n't  do  it <period> thank  you  very  much <period> where  do  we  go  from  here <questionmark> how  do  we  carry  on <questionmark> i  cannot  get  beyond  the  questions  clambering  for  the  scraps  in  the  shatter  of  us <comma> collapsed  it  cuts  me  with  every  could  have  been  pain

/transcript <period> my  title <comma> queerer  than  we  can  suppose <comma> the  strangeness  of  science <period> queerer  than  we  can  suppose  comes  from  jbs <period> haldane <comma> the  famous  biologist <comma> who  said <comma> now <comma> my  own  suspicion  is  that  the  universe  is  not  only  queerer  than  we  suppose <comma> but  queerer  than  we  can  suppose <period> i  suspect  that  there  are  more  things  in  heaven  and  earth  than  are  dreamed  of <comma> or  can  be  dreamed  of <comma> in  any  philosophy <period> richard  feynman  compared  the  accuracy  of  quantum  theories <comma> experimental  predictions <comma> to  specifying  the  width  of  north  america  to  within  one  hair  's  breadth  of  accuracy <period> this  means  that  quantum  theory  has  got  to  be  in  some  sense  true <period> yet  the  assumptions  that  quantum  theory  needs  to  make  in  order  to  deliver  those  predictions  are  so  mysterious  that  even  feynman  himself  was  moved  to  remark <comma> if  you  think  you  understand  quantum  theory <comma> you  do  n't  understand  quantum  theory <period> it  's  so  queer  that  physicists  resort  to  one  or  another  paradoxical  interpretation  of  it <period> david  deutsch <comma> who  's  talking  here <comma> in  the  fabric  of  reality <comma> embraces  the  many  worlds  interpretation  of  quantum  theory <comma> because  the  worst  that  you  can  say  about  it  is  that  it  's  preposterously  wasteful <period> it  postulates  a  vast  and  rapidly  growing  number  of  universes  existing  in  parallel <comma> mutually  undetectable  except  through  the  narrow  porthole  of  quantum  mechanical  experiments <period> and  that  's  richard  feynman <period> the  biologist  lewis  wolpert  believes  that  the  queerness  of  modern  physics  is  just  an  extreme  example <period> science <comma> as  opposed  to  technology <comma> does  violence  to  common  sense <period> every  time  you  drink  a  glass  of  water <comma> he  points  out <comma> the  odds  are  that  you  will  imbibe  at  least  one  molecule  that  passed  through  the

or  bladdersful <comma> in  the  world <comma> and <comma> of  course <comma> there  's  nothing  special  about  cromwell  or  bladders <period> you  have  just  breathed  in  a  nitrogen  atom  that

supposing  anything <comma> and  does  this  tell  us  anything  about  what  we  can  suppose <questionmark> are  there  things  about  the  universe  that  will  be  forever  beyond  our  grasp <comma> but  not  beyond  the  grasp  of  some  superior  intelligence <questionmark> are  there  things  about  the  universe  that  are <comma> in  principle <comma> ungraspable  by  any  mind <comma> however  superior <questionmark> the  history  of  science  has  been  one  long  series  of  violent  brainstorms <comma> as  successive  generations  have  come  to  terms  with  increasing  levels  of  queerness  in  the  universe <period> we  're  now  so  used  to  the  idea  that  the  earth  spins <comma> rather  than  the  sun  moves  across  the  sky <comma> it  's  hard  for  us  to  realize  what  a  shattering  mental  revolution  that  must  have  been <period> after  all <comma> it  seems  obvious  that  the  earth  is  large  and  motionless <comma> the  sun  small  and  mobile <period> but  it  's  worth  recalling  wittgenstein  's  remark  on  the  subject <period> tell  me <comma> he  asked  a  friend <comma> why  do  people  always  say <comma> it  was  natural  for  man  to  assume  that  the  sun  went  round  the  earth  rather  than  that  the  earth  was  rotating <questionmark> his  friend  replied <comma> well <comma> obviously  because  it  just  looks  as  though  the  sun  is  going  round  the  earth <period> wittgenstein  replied <comma> well <comma> what  would  it  have  looked  like  if  it  had  looked  as  though  the  earth  was  rotating <questionmark> science  has  taught  us <comma> against  all  intuition <comma> that  apparently  solid  things <comma> like  crystals  and  rocks <comma> are  really  almost  entirely  composed  of  empty  space <period> and  the  familiar  illustration  is  the  nucleus  of  an  atom  is  a  fly  in  the  middle  of  a  sports  stadium  and  the  next  atom  is  in  the  next  sports  stadium <period> so  it  would  seem  the  hardest <comma> solidest <comma> densest  rock  is  really  almost  entirely  empty  space <comma> broken  only  by  tiny  particles  so  widely  spaced  they  should  n't  count <period> why <comma> then <comma> do  rocks  look  and  feel  solid  and  hard  and  impenetrable <questionmark> as  an  evolutionary  biologist <comma> i'd  say  this <comma> our  brains  have  evolved  to  help  us  survive  within  the  orders  of  magnitude  of  size  and  speed  which  our  bodies  operate  at <period> we  never  evolved  to  navigate  in  the  world  of  atoms <period> if  we  had <comma> our  brains  probably  would  perceive  rocks  as  full  of  empty  space <period> rocks  feel  hard  and  impenetrable  to  our  hands  precisely  because  objects  like  rocks  and  hands  cannot  penetrate  each  other <period> it  's  therefore  useful  for  our  brains  to  construct  notions  like  solidity  and  impenetrability <comma> because  such  notions  help  us  to  navigate  our  bodies  through  the  middle-sized  world  in  which  we  have  to  navigate <period> moving  to  the  other  end  of  the  scale <comma> our  ancestors  never  had  to  navigate  through  the  cosmos  at  speeds  close  to  the  speed  of  light <period> if  they  had <comma> our  brains  would  be  much  better  at  understanding  einstein <period> i  want  to  give  the  name  middle  world  to  the  medium-scaled  environment  in  which  we've  evolved  the  ability  to  take  act <comma> nothing  to  do  with  middle  earth <period>

a  westerly  direction  at  a  speed  of  about  17  meters  per  year <period> it  retains  its  crescent  shape  and  moves  in  the  direction  of  the  horns <period> what  happens  is  that  the  wind  blows  the  sand  up  the  shallow  slope  on  the  other  side <comma> and  then <comma> as  each  sand  grain  hits  the  top  of  the  ridge <comma> it  cascades  down  on  the  inside  of  the  crescent <comma> and  so  the  whole  horn-shaped  dune  moves <period> steve  grand  points  out  that  you  and  i  are <comma> ourselves <comma> more  like  a  wave  than  a  permanent  thing <period> he  invites  us <comma> the  reader <comma> to  think  of  an  experience  from  your  childhood <comma> something  you  remember  clearly <comma> something  you  can  see <comma> feel <comma> maybe  even  smell <comma> as  if  you  were  really  there <period> after  all <comma> you  really  were  there  at  the  time <comma> were  n't  you <questionmark> how  else  would  you  remember  it <questionmark> but  here  is  the  bombshell <comma> you  were  n't  there <period> not  a  single  atom  that  is  in  your  body  today  was  there  when  that  event  took  place <period> matter  flows  from  place  to  place  and  momentarily  comes  together  to  be  you <period> whatever  you  are <comma> therefore <comma> you  are  not  the  stuff  of  which  you  are  made <period> if  that  does  n't  make  the  hair  stand  up  on  the  back  of  your  neck <comma> read  it  again  until  it  does <comma> because  it  is  important <period> so  really  is  n't  a  word  that  we  should  use  with  simple  confidence <period> if  a  neutrino  had  a  brain <comma> which  it  evolved  in  neutrino-sized  ancestors <comma> it  would  say  that  rocks  really  do  consist  of  empty  space <period> we  have  brains  that  evolved  in  medium-sized  ancestors  which  could  n't  walk  through  rocks <period> really <comma> for  an  animal <comma> is  whatever  its  brain  needs  it  to  be  in  order  to  assist  its  survival <period> and  because  different  species  live  in  different  worlds <comma> there  will  be  a  discomforting  variety  of  reallys <period> what  we  see  of  the  real  world  is  not  the  unvarnished  world  but  a  model  of  the  world <comma> regulated  and  adjusted  by  sense  data <comma> but  constructed  so  it  's  useful  for  dealing  with  the  real  world <period> the  nature  of  the  model  depends  on  the  kind  of  animal  we  are <period> a  flying  animal  needs  a  different  kind  of  model  from  a  walking <comma> climbing  or  swimming  animal <period> a  monkey  's  brain  must  have  software  capable  of  simulating  a  three-dimensional  world  of  branches  and  trunks <period> a  mole  's  software  for  constructing  models  of  its  world  will  be  customized  for  underground  use <period> a  water  strider  's  brain  does  n't  need  3d  software  at  all <comma> since  it  lives  on  the  surface  of  the  pond  in  an  edwin  abbott  flatland <period> i've  speculated  that  bats  may  see  color  with  their  ears <period> the  world  model  that  a  bat  needs  in  order  to  navigate  through  three  dimensions  catching  insects  must  be  pretty  similar  to  the  world  model  that  any  flying  bird <period> a  day-flying  bird  like  a  swallow <comma> needs  to  perform  the  same  kind  of  tasks <period> the  fact  that  the  bat  uses  echoes  in  pitch  darkness  to  input  the  current  variables  to  its  model <comma> while  the  swallow  uses  light <comma> is  incidental <period> bats <comma> i've  even  suggested <comma> use  perceived  hues <comma> such  as  red  and  blue <comma> as  labels <comma> internal  labels <comma> for  some  useful  aspect  of  echoes <comma> perhaps  the  acoustic  texture  of  surfaces <comma> furry  or  smooth  and  so  on <comma> in  the  same  way  as  swallows  or <comma> indeed <comma> we <comma> use  those  perceived  hues <comma> redness  and  blueness  etc <comma> to  label  long  and  short  wavelengths  of  light <period> there  's  nothing  inherent  about  red  that  makes  it  long  wavelength <period> and  the  point  is  that  the  nature  of  the  model  is  governed  by  how  it  is  to  be  used <comma> rather  than  by  the  sensory  modality  involved <period> j <period> b  s <period> haldane  himself  had  something  to  say  about  animals  whose  world  is  dominated  by  smell <period> dogs  can  distinguish  two  very  similar  fatty  acids <comma> extremely  diluted <comma> caprylic  acid  and  caproic  acid <period> the  only  difference <comma> you  see <comma> is  that  one  has  an  extra  pair  of  carbon  atoms  in  the  chain <period> haldane  guesses  that  a  dog  would  probably  be  able  to  place  the  acids  in  the  order  of  their  molecular  weights  by  their  smells <comma> just  as  a  man  could  place  a  number  of  piano  wires  in  the  order  of  their  lengths  by  means  of  their  notes <period> now <comma> there  's  another  fatty  acid <comma> capric  acid <comma> which  is  just  like  the  other  two <comma> except  that  it  has  two  more  carbon  atoms <period> a  dog  that  had  never  met  capric  acid  would <comma> perhaps <comma> have  no  more  trouble  imagining  its  smell  than  we  would  have  trouble  imagining  a  trumpet <comma> say <comma> playing  one  note  higher  than  we've  heard  a  trumpet  play  before <period> perhaps  dogs  and  rhinos  and  other  smell-oriented  animals  smell  in  color <period> and  the  argument  would  be  exactly  the  same  as  for  the  bats <period> middle  world <comma> the  range  of  sizes  and  speeds  which  we  have  evolved  to  feel  intuitively  comfortable  with <comma> is  a  bit  like  the  narrow  range  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  that  we  see  as  light  of  various  colors <period> we  're  blind  to  all  frequencies  outside  that <comma> unless  we  use  instruments  to  help  us <period> middle  world  is  the  narrow  range  of  reality  which  we  judge  to  be  normal <comma> as  opposed  to  the  queerness  of  the  very  small <comma> the  very  large  and  the  very  fast <period> we  could  make  a  similar  scale  of  improbabilities <period> nothing  is  totally  impossible <period> miracles  are  just  events  that  are  extremely  improbable <period> a  marble  statue  could  wave  its  hand  at  us <period> the  atoms  that  make  up  its  crystalline  structure  are  all  vibrating  back  and  forth  anyway <period> because  there  are  so  many  of  them <comma> and  because  there  's  no  agreement  among  them  in  their  preferred  direction  of  movement <comma> the  marble <comma> as  we  see  it  in  middle  world <comma> stays  rock  steady <period> but  the  atoms  in  the  hand  could  all  just  happen  to  move  the  same  way  at  the  same  time <comma> and  again  and  again <period> in  this  case <comma> the  hand  would  move  and  we'd  see  it  waving  at  us  in  middle  world <period> the  odds  against  it <comma> of  course <comma> are  so  great  that  if  you  set  out  writing  zeros  at  the  time  of  the  origin  of  the  universe <comma> you  still  would  not  have  written  enough  zeros  to  this  day <period> evolution  in  middle  world  has  not  equipped  us  to  handle  very  improbable  events <period> we  do  n't  live  long  enough <period> in  the  vastness  of  astronomical  space  and  geological  time <comma> that  which  seems  impossible  in  middle  world  might  turn  out  to  be  inevitable <period> one  way  to  think  about  that  is  by  counting  planets <period> we  do  n't  know  how  many  planets  there  are  in  the  universe <comma> but  a  good  estimate  is  about  10  to  the  20 <comma> or  100  billion  billion <period> and  that  gives  us  a  nice  way  to  express  our  estimate  of  life  's  improbability <period> could  make  some  sort  of  landmark  points  along  a  spectrum  of  improbability <comma> which  might  look  like  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  we  just  looked  at <period> if  life  has  arisen  only  once  on  any <comma> if <comma> if  life  could <comma> i  mean <comma> life  could  originate  once  per  planet <comma> could  be  extremely  common <comma> or  it  could  originate  once  per  star <comma> or  once  per  galaxy  or  maybe  only  once  in  the  entire  universe <comma> in  which  case  it  would  have  to  be  here <period> and  somewhere  up  there  would  be  the  chance  that  a  frog  would  turn  into  a  prince  and  similar  magical  things  like  that <period> if  life  has  arisen  on  only  one  planet  in  the  entire  universe <comma> that  planet  has  to  be  our  planet <comma> because  here  we  are  talking  about  it <period> and  that  means  that  if  we  want  to  avail  ourselves  of  it <comma> we  're  allowed  to  postulate  chemical  events  in  the  origin  of  life  which  have  a  probability  as  low  as  one  in  100  billion  billion <period> i  do  n't  think  we  shall  have  to  avail  ourselves  of  that <comma> because  i  suspect  that  life  is  quite  common  in  the  universe <period> and  when  i  say  quite  common <comma> it  could  still  be  so  rare  that  no  one  island  of  life  ever  encounters  another <period> which  is  a  sad  thought <period> how  shall  we  interpret  queerer  than  we  can  suppose <questionmark> queerer  than  can  in  principle  be  supposed <comma> or  just  queerer  than  we  can  suppose <comma> given  the  limitations  of  our  brain  's  evolutionary  apprenticeship  in  middle  world <questionmark> could  we <comma> by  training  and  practice <comma> emancipate  ourselves  from  middle  world  and  achieve  some  sort  of  intuitive <comma> as  well  as  mathematical <comma> understanding  of  the  very  small  and  the  very  large <questionmark> i  genuinely  do  n't  know  the  answer <period> i  wonder  whether  we  might  help  ourselves  to  understand <comma> say <comma> quantum  theory <comma> if  we  brought  up  children  to  play  computer  games <comma> beginning  in  early  childhood <comma> which  had  a  sort  of  make-believe  world  of  balls  going  through  two  slits  on  a  screen <comma> a  world  in  which  the  strange  goings  on  of  quantum  mechanics  were  enlarged  by  the  computer  's  make-believe <comma> so  that  they  became  familiar  on  the  middle-world  scale  of  the  stream <period> and <comma> similarly <comma> a  relativistic  computer  game  in  which  objects  on  the  screen  manifest  the  lorenz  contraction <comma> and  so  on <comma> to  try  to  get  ourselves  into  the  way  of  thinking <comma> get  children  into  the  way  of  thinking  about  it <period> i  want  to  end  by  applying  the  idea  of  middle  world  to  our  perceptions  of  each  other <period> most  scientists  today  subscribe  to  a  mechanistic  view  of  the  mind <comma> we  're  the  way  we  are  because  our  brains  are  wired  up  as  they  are <period> our  hormones  are  the  way  they  are <period> we'd  be  different <comma> our  characters  would  be  different <comma> if  our  neuro-anatomy  and  our  physiological  chemistry  were  different <period> but  we  scientists  are  inconsistent <period> if  we  were  consistent <comma> our  response  to  a  misbehaving  person <comma> like  a  child-murderer <comma> should  be  something  like <comma> this  unit  has  a  faulty  component <period> it  needs  repairing <period> that  's  not  what  we  say <period> what  we  say <comma> and  i  include  the  most  austerely  mechanistic  among  us <comma> which  is  probably  me <comma> what  we  say  is <comma> vile  monster <comma> prison  is  too  good  for  you <period> or  worse <comma> we  seek  revenge <comma> in  all  probability  thereby  triggering  the  next  phase  in  an  escalating  cycle  of  counter-revenge <comma> which  we  see <comma> of  course <comma> all  over  the  world  today <period> in  short <comma> when  we  're  thinking  like  academics <comma> we  regard  people  as  elaborate  and  complicated  machines <comma> like  computers  or  cars <comma> but  when  we  revert  to  being  human  we  behave  more  like  basil  fawlty <comma> who <comma> we  remember <comma> thrashed  his  car  to  teach  it  a  lesson  when  it  would  n't  start  on  gourmet  night <period> the  reason  we  personify  things  like  cars  and  computers  is  that  just  as  monkeys  live  in  an  arboreal  world  and  moles  live  in  an  underground  world  and  water  striders  live  in  a  surface  tension-dominated  flatland <comma> we  live  in  a  social  world <period> we  swim  through  a  sea  of  people <comma> a  social  version  of  middle  world <period> we  are  evolved  to  second-guess  the  behavior  of  others  by  becoming  brilliant <comma> intuitive  psychologists <period> treating  people  as  machines  may  be  scientifically  and  philosophically  accurate <period> but  it  's  a  cumbersome  waste  of  time  if  you  want  to  guess  what  this  person  is  going  to  do  next <period> the  economically  useful  way  to  model  a  person  is  to  treat  him  as  a  purposeful <comma> goal-seeking  agent  with  pleasures  and  pains <comma> desires  and  intentions <comma> guilt <comma> blame-worthiness <period> personification  and  the  imputing  of  intentional  purpose  is  such  a  brilliantly  successful  way  to  model  humans <comma> it  's  hardly  surprising  the  same  modeling  software  often  seizes  control  when  we  're  trying  to  think  about  entities  for  which  it  's  not  appropriate <comma> like  basil  fawlty  with  his  car  or  like  millions  of  deluded  people  with  the  universe  as  a  whole <period> if  the  universe  is  queerer  than  we  can  suppose <comma> is  it  just  because  we've  been  naturally  selected  to  suppose  only  what  we  needed  to  suppose  in  order  to  survive  in  the  pleistocene  of  africa <questionmark> or  are  our  brains  so  versatile  and  expandable  that  we  can  train  ourselves  to  break  out  of  the  box  of  our  evolution <questionmark> or <comma> finally <comma> are  there  some  things  in  the  universe  so  queer  that  no  philosophy  of  beings <comma> however  godlike <comma> could  dream  them <questionmark> thank  you  very  much <period> some  of  the  greatest  innovations  and  developments  in  the  world  often  happen  at  the  intersection  of  two  fields <period> so  tonight  i'd  like  to  tell  you  about  the  intersection  that  i  'm  most  excited  about  at  this  very  moment <comma> which  is  entertainment  and  robotics <period> so  if  we  're  trying  to  make  robots  that  can  be  more  expressive  and  that  can  connect  better  with  us  in  society <comma> maybe  we  should  look  to  some  of  the  human  professionals  of  artificial  emotion  and  personality  that  occur  in  the  dramatic  arts <period> i  'm  also  interested  in  creating  new  technologies  for  the  arts  and  to  attract  people  to  science  and  technology <period> some  people  in  the  last  decade  or  two  have  started  creating  artwork  with  technology <period> with  my  new  venture <comma> marilyn  monrobot <comma> i  would  like  to  use  art  to  create  tech <period> so  we  're  based  in  new  york  city <period> and  if  you  're  a  performer  that  wants  to  collaborate  with  an  adorable  robot <comma> or  if  you  have  a  robot  that  needs  entertainment  representation <comma> please  contact  me <comma> the  bot-agent <period> the  bot <comma> our  rising  celebrity <comma> also  has  his  own  twitter  account <comma> @robotinthewild <period> i'd  like  to  introduce  you  to  one  of  our  first  robots <comma> data <period> he  's  named  after  the  star  trek  character <period> i  think  he  's  going  to  be  super  popular <period> we've  got  the  robot <comma> in  his  head  is  a  database  of  a  lot  of  jokes <period> now  each  of  these  jokes  is  labeled  with  certain  attributes <period> so  it  knows  something  about  the  subject <period> it  knows  about  the  length <period> it  knows  how  much  it  's  moving <period> and  so  it  's  going  to  try  to  watch  your  response <period> i  actually  have  no  idea  what  my  robot  is  going  to  do  today <period> it  can  also  learn  from  you  about  the  quality  of  its  jokes  and  cater  things <comma> sort  of  like  netflix-style <comma> over  longer-term  to  different  communities  or  audiences <comma> children  versus  adults <comma> different  cultures <period> you  can  learn  something  from  the  robot  about  the  community  that  you  're  in <period> and  also  i  can  use  each  one  of  you  as  the  acting  coach  to  our  future  robot  companions <period> some  of  you  in  this  middle  section <comma> you  have  red/green  paddles <period> if  you  like  what  's  going  on <comma> show  the  green <period> if  you  do  n't  like  the  subject  or  the  performance <comma> you  can  hold  the  red <period> now  do  n't  be  shy <period> it  's  just  a  robot <period> it  does  n't  have  feelings <period> yet <period> and  the  rest  of  you <comma> you  still  count <comma> you  still  matter <period> there  's  also  a  microphone  that  's  listening  to  the  aggregate  laughter  and  applause  and  booing <comma> i  hope  not <comma> to  help  make  some  of  its  next  decisions <period> right <comma> so <comma> let  the  robot  stand-up  comedy  begin <period> data <comma> hello  tedwomen <period> it  's  an  honor  to  be  here <period> you  guys  are  looking  good  out  there <period> ready  for  some  jokes <questionmark> audience <comma> yeah <period> data <comma> here  's  the  first  one <period> right <comma> so <comma> a  doctor  says  to  his  patient <comma> i  have  bad  news  and  worse  news <period> the  bad  news  is  that  you  only  have  24  hours  to  live  that  's  terrible <comma> said  the  patient <period> how  can  the  news  possibly  be  worse  i've  been  trying  to  contact  you  since  yesterday  the  swiss  have  an  interesting  army <period> five  hundred  years  without  a  war <period> heather  knight <comma> he  's  talking  about  the  swiss <period> data <comma> pretty  lucky  for  them <period> ever  see  that  little  swiss  army  knife  they  have  to  fight  with <questionmark> come  on  buddy <comma> i  have  the  toe  clippers  right  here <period> you  get  past  me <comma> the  guy  behind  me  has  a  spoon  hk <comma> he  's  a  french  robot <period> data <comma> a  couple  of  new  jersey  hunters  are  out  in  the  woods <period> one  of  them  falls  to  the  ground <period> he  does  not  seem  to  be  breathing <period> the  other  guy  whips  out  his  cell  phone  and  calls  911 <period> he  gasps  to  the  operator <comma> my  friend  is  dead <period> what  can  i  do  the  operator  says <comma> just  take  it  easy <period> i  can  help <period> first <comma> let  's  make  sure  he  's  dead  there  is  a  silence <comma> and  the  operator  hears  a  shot <period> the  guy  's  voice  comes  back  on  the  line <comma> okay <comma> now  what  question <comma> why  is  television  called  a  medium <questionmark> anyone <questionmark> because  it  's  neither  rare  nor  well  done <period> but  to  be  completely  honest  with  you <comma> i  kind  of  love  television <period> any  of  you  like  television <questionmark> audience <comma> yes <period> data <comma> i  find  it  incredibly  educational <period> actually <comma> as  soon  as  someone  turns  it  on <comma> i  go  into  the  other  room  and  read <period> that  's  all  for  now <period> was  that  okay  for  my  first  time <questionmark> you've  been  a  great  audience <period> thank  you <period> hk <comma> yay <period> so  this  is  actually  the  first  time  we've  ever  done  live  audience  feedback  to  a  performance <period> so  thank  you  all  for  being  a  part  of  it <period> there  's  a  lot  more  to  come <period> and  we  hope  to  learn  a  lot  about  robot  expression <period> thank  you  very  much <period> well <comma> that  's  kind  of  an  obvious  statement  up  there <period> i  started  with  that  sentence  about  12  years  ago <comma> and  i  started  in  the  context  of  developing  countries <comma> but  you  're  sitting  here  from  every  corner  of  the  world <period> so  if  you  think  of  a  map  of  your  country <comma> i  think  you  'll  realize  that  for  every  country  on  earth <comma> you  could  draw  little  circles  to  say <comma> these  are  places  where  good  teachers  wo  n't  go <period> on  top  of  that <comma> those  are  the  places  from  where  trouble  comes <period> so  we  have  an  ironic  problem  -- <period> good  teachers  do  n't  want  to  go  to  just  those  places  where  they  're  needed  the  most <period> i  started  in  1999  to  try  and  address  this  problem  with  an  experiment <comma> which  was  a  very  simple  experiment  in  new  delhi <period> i  basically  embedded  a  computer  into  a  wall  of  a  slum  in  new  delhi <period> the  children  barely  went  to  school <comma> they  did  n't  know  any  english  -- <period> they'd  never  seen  a  computer  before <comma> and  they  did  n't  know  what  the  internet  was <period> i  connected  high  speed  internet  to  it <comma> it  's  about  three  feet  off  the  ground <comma> turned  it  on  and  left  it  there <period> after  this <comma> we  noticed  a  couple  of  interesting  things <comma> which  you  'll  see <period> but  i  repeated  this  all  over  india  and  then  through  a  large  part  of  the  world  and  noticed  that  children  will  learn  to  do  what  they  want  to  learn  to  do <period> this  is  the  first  experiment  that  we  did <comma> eight  year-old  boy  on  your  right  teaching  his  student <comma> a  six  year-old  girl <comma> and  he  was  teaching  her  how  to  browse <period> this  boy  here  in  the  middle  of  central  india <comma> this  is  in  a  rajasthan  village <comma> where  the  children  recorded  their  own  music  and  then  played  it  back  to  each  other  and  in  the  process <comma> they've  enjoyed  themselves  thoroughly <period> they  did  all  of  this  in  four  hours  after  seeing  the  computer  for  the  first  time <period> in  another  south  indian  village <comma> these  boys  here  had  assembled  a  video  camera  and  were  trying  to  take  the  photograph  of  a  bumble  bee <period> they  downloaded  it  from  disneycom <comma> or  one  of  these  websites <comma> 14  days  after  putting  the  computer  in  their  village <period> so  at  the  end  of  it <comma> we  concluded  that  groups  of  children  can  learn  to  use  computers  and  the  internet  on  their  own <comma> irrespective  of  who  or  where  they  were <period> at  that  point <comma> i  became  a  little  more  ambitious  and  decided  to  see  what  else  could  children  do  with  a  computer <period> we  started  off  with  an  experiment  in  hyderabad <comma> india <comma> where  i  gave  a  group  of  children <comma> they  spoke  english  with  a  very  strong  telugu  accent <period> i  gave  them  a  computer  with  a  speech-to-text  interface <comma> which  you  now  get  free  with  windows <comma> and  asked  them  to  speak  into  it <period> so  when  they  spoke  into  it <comma> the  computer  typed  out  gibberish <comma> so  they  said <comma> well <comma> it  does  n't  understand  anything  of  what  we  are  saying <period> so  i  said <comma> yeah <comma> i  'll  leave  it  here  for  two  months <period> make  yourself  understood  to  the  computer <period> so  the  children  said <comma> how  do  we  do  that <period> and  i  said <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> actually <period> and  i  left <period> two  months  later <comma> and  this  is  now  documented  in  the  information  technology  for  international  development  journal <comma> that  accents  had  changed  and  were  remarkably  close  to  the  neutral  british  accent  in  which  i  had  trained  the  speech-to-text  synthesizer <period> in  other  words <comma> they  were  all  speaking  like  james  tooley <period> so  they  could  do  that  on  their  own <period> after  that <comma> i  started  to  experiment  with  various  other  things  that  they  might  learn  to  do  on  their  own <period> i  got  an  interesting  phone  call  once  from  columbo <comma> from  the  late  arthur  c <period> clarke <comma> who  said <comma> i  want  to  see  what  's  going  on <period> and  he  could  n't  travel <comma> so  i  went  over  there <period> he  said  two  interesting  things <comma> a  teacher  that  can  be  replaced  by  a  machine  should  be <period> the  second  thing  he  said  was  that <comma> if  children  have  interest <comma> then  education  happens  and  i  was  doing  that  in  the  field <comma> so  every  time  i  would  watch  it  and  think  of  him <period> arthur  c <period> clarke <comma> and  they  can  definitely  help  people <comma> because  children  quickly  learn  to  navigate  the  web  and  find  things  which  interest  them <period> and  when  you've  got  interest <comma> then  you  have  education <period> sugata  mitra <comma> i  took  the  experiment  to  south  africa <period> this  is  a  15  year-old  boy <period> boy <period> just  mention <comma> i  play  games  like  animals <comma> and  i  listen  to  music <period> sm <comma> and  i  asked  him <comma> do  you  send  emails <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> yes <comma> and  they  hop  across  the  ocean <period> this  is  in  cambodia <comma> rural  cambodia <comma> a  fairly  silly  arithmetic  game <comma> which  no  child  would  play  inside  the  classroom  or  at  home <period> they  would <comma> you  know <comma> throw  it  back  at  you <period> they'd  say <comma> this  is  very  boring <period> if  you  leave  it  on  the  pavement  and  if  all  the  adults  go  away <comma> then  they  will  show  off  with  each  other  about  what  they  can  do <period> this  is  what  these  children  are  doing <period> they  are  trying  to  multiply <comma> i  think <period> and  all  over  india <comma> at  the  end  of  about  two  years <comma> children  were  beginning  to  google  their  homework <period> as  a  result <comma> the  teachers  reported  tremendous  improvements  in  their  english <comma> rapid  improvement  and  all  sorts  of  things <period> they  said <comma> they  have  become  really  deep  thinkers  and  so  on  and  so  forth <period> and  indeed  they  had <period> i  mean <comma> if  there  's  stuff  on  google <comma> why  would  you  need  to  stuff  it  into  your  head <questionmark> so  at  the  end  of  the  next  four  years <comma> i  decided  that  groups  of  children  can  navigate  the  internet  to  achieve  educational  objectives  on  their  own <period> at  that  time <comma> a  large  amount  of  money  had  come  into  newcastle  university  to  improve  schooling  in  india <period> so  newcastle  gave  me  a  call <period> i  said <comma> i  'll  do  it  from  delhi <period> they  said <comma> there  's  no  way  you  're  going  to  handle  a  million  pounds-worth  of  university  money  sitting  in  delhi <period> so  in  2006 <comma> i  bought  myself  a  heavy  overcoat  and  moved  to  newcastle <period> i  wanted  to  test  the  limits  of  the  system <period> the  first  experiment  i  did  out  of  newcastle  was  actually  done  in  india <period> and  i  set  myself  and  impossible  target <comma> can  tamil  speaking  12-year-old  children  in  a  south  indian  village  teach  themselves  biotechnology  in  english  on  their  own <questionmark> and  i  thought <comma> i  'll  test  them <comma> they  'll  get  a  zero  -- <period> i  'll  give  the  materials <comma> i  'll  come  back  and  test  them  -- <period> they  get  another  zero <period> i  'll  go  back  and  say <comma> yes <comma> we  need  teachers  for  certain  things <period> i  called  in  26  children <period> they  all  came  in  there <comma> and  i  told  them  that  there  's  some  really  difficult  stuff  on  this  computer <period> i  would  n't  be  surprised  if  you  did  n't  understand  anything <period> it  's  all  in  english <comma> and  i  'm  going <period> so  i  left  them  with  it <period> i  came  back  after  two  months <comma> and  the  26  children  marched  in  looking  very <comma> very  quiet <period> i  said <comma> well <comma> did  you  look  at  any  of  the  stuff <questionmark> they  said <comma> yes <comma> we  did <period> did  you  understand  anything  no <comma> nothing <period> so  i  said <comma> well <comma> how  long  did  you  practice  on  it  before  you  decided  you  understood  nothing <questionmark> they  said <comma> we  look  at  it  every  day <period> so  i  said <comma> for  two  months <comma> you  were  looking  at  stuff  you  did  n't  understand <questionmark> so  a  12  year-old  girl  raises  her  hand  and  says <comma> literally <comma> apart  from  the  fact  that  improper  replication  of  the  dna  molecule  causes  genetic  disease <comma> we've  understood  nothing  else <period> it  took  me  three  years  to  publish  that <period> it  's  just  been  published  in  the  british  journal  of  educational  technology <period> one  of  the  referees  who  refereed  the  paper  said <comma> it  's  too  good  to  be  true <comma> which  was  not  very  nice <period> well <comma> one  of  the  girls  had  taught  herself  to  become  the  teacher <period> and  then  that  's  her  over  there <period> remember <comma> they  do  n't  study  english <period> i  edited  out  the  last  bit  when  i  asked <comma> where  is  the  neuron <questionmark> and  she  says <comma> the  neuron <questionmark> the  neuron <period> and  then  she  looked  and  did  this <period> whatever  the  expression <comma> it  was  not  very  nice <period> so  their  scores  had  gone  up  from  zero  to  30  percent <comma> which  is  an  educational  impossibility  under  the  circumstances <period> but  30  percent  is  not  a  pass <period> so  i  found  that  they  had  a  friend <comma> a  local  accountant <comma> a  young  girl <comma> and  they  played  football  with  her <period> i  asked  that  girl <comma> would  you  teach  them  enough  biotechnology  to  pass <questionmark> and  she  said <comma> how  would  i  do  that <questionmark> i  do  n't  know  the  subject <period> i  said <comma> no <comma> use  the  method  of  the  grandmother <period> she  said <comma> what  's  that <questionmark> i  said <comma> well <comma> what  you've  got  to  do  is  stand  behind  them  and  admire  them  all  the  time <period> just  say  to  them <comma> that  's  cool <period> that  's  fantastic <period> what  is  that <questionmark> can  you  do  that  again <questionmark> can  you  show  me  some  more' <period> she  did  that  for  two  months <period> the  scores  went  up  to  50 <comma> which  is  what  the  posh  schools  of  new  delhi <comma> with  a  trained  biotechnology  teacher  were  getting <period> so  i  came  back  to  newcastle  with  these  results  and  decided  that  there  was  something  happening  here  that  definitely  was  getting  very  serious <period> so <comma> having  experimented  in  all  sorts  of  remote  places <comma> i  came  to  the  most  remote  place  that  i  could  think  of <period> approximately  5,000  miles  from  delhi  is  the  little  town  of  gateshead <period> in  gateshead <comma> i  took  32  children  and  i  started  to  fine-tune  the  method <period> i  made  them  into  groups  of  four <period> i  said <comma> you  make  your  own  groups  of  four <period> each  group  of  four  can  use  one  computer  and  not  four  computers <period> remember <comma> from  the  hole  in  the  wall <period> you  can  exchange  groups <period> you  can  walk  across  to  another  group <comma> if  you  do  n't  like  your  group <comma> etc <period> you  can  go  to  another  group <comma> peer  over  their  shoulders <comma> see  what  they  're  doing <comma> come  back  to  you  own  group  and  claim  it  as  your  own  work <period> and  i  explained  to  them  that <comma> you  know <comma> a  lot  of  scientific  research  is  done  using  that  method <period> the  children  enthusiastically  got  after  me  and  said <comma> now <comma> what  do  you  want  us  to  do <questionmark> i  gave  them  six  gcse  questions <period> the  first  group <comma> the  best  one <comma> solved  everything  in  20  minutes <period> the  worst <comma> in  45 <period> they  used  everything  that  they  knew <comma> news  groups <comma> google <comma> wikipedia <comma> ask  jeeves <comma> etc <period> the  teachers  said <comma> is  this  deep  learning <questionmark> i  said <comma> well <comma> let  's  try  it <period> i  'll  come  back  after  two  months <period> we  'll  give  them  a  paper  test <comma> no  computers <comma> no  talking  to  each  other <comma> etc <period> the  average  score  when  i'd  done  it  with  the  computers  and  the  groups  was  76  percent <period> when  i  did  the  experiment <comma> when  i  did  the  test <comma> after  two  months <comma> the  score  was  76  percent <period> there  was  photographic  recall  inside  the  children <period> i  suspect  because  they  're  discussing  with  each  other <period> a  single  child  in  front  of  a  single  computer  will  not  do  that <period> i  have  further  results <comma> which  are  almost  unbelievable <comma> of  scores  which  go  up  with  time <period> because  their  teachers  say  that  after  the  session  is  over <comma> the  children  continue  to  google  further <period> here  in  britain <comma> i  put  out  a  call  for  british  grandmothers <comma> after  my  kuppam  experiment <period> well <comma> you  know <comma> they  're  very  vigorous  people <comma> british  grandmothers <period> 200  of  them  volunteered  immediately <period> the  deal  was  that  they  would  give  me  one  hour  of  broadband  time <comma> sitting  in  their  homes <comma> one  day  in  a  week <period> so  they  did  that <period> and  over  the  last  two  years <comma> over  600  hours  of  instruction  has  happened  over  skype <comma> using  what  my  students  call  the  granny  cloud <period> the  granny  cloud  sits  over  there <period> i  can  beam  them  to  whichever  school  i  want  to <period> teacher <comma> you  cannot  catch  me <period> you  say  it <period> you  cannot  catch  me <period> children <comma> you  cannot  catch  me <period> teacher <comma> i  'm  the  gingerbread  man <period> children <comma> i  'm  the  gingerbread  man <period> teacher <comma> well  done <period> very  good <period> sm <comma> back  at  gateshead <comma> a  10-year-old  girl  gets  into  the  heart  of  hinduism  in  15  minutes <period> you  know <comma> stuff  which  i  do  n't  know  anything  about <period> two  children  watch  a  tedtalk <period> they  wanted  to  be  footballers  before <period> after  watching  eight  tedtalks <comma> he  wants  to  become  leonardo  da  vinci <period> it  's  pretty  simple  stuff <period> this  is  what  i  'm  building  now  -- <period> they  're  called  soles <comma> self  organized  learning  environments <period> the  furniture  is  designed  so  that  children  can  sit  in  front  of  big <comma> powerful  screens <comma> big  broadband  connections <comma> but  in  groups <period> if  they  want <comma> they  can  call  the  granny  cloud <period> this  is  a  sole  in  newcastle <period> the  mediator  is  from  pune <comma> india <period> so  how  far  can  we  go <questionmark> one  last  little  bit  and  i  'll  stop <period> i  went  to  turin  in  may <period> i  sent  all  the  teachers  away  from  my  group  of  10  year-old  students <period> i  speak  only  english <comma> they  speak  only  italian <comma> so  we  had  no  way  to  communicate <period> i  started  writing  english  questions  on  the  blackboard <period> the  children  looked  at  it  and  said <comma> what <questionmark> i  said <comma> well <comma> do  it <period> they  typed  it  into  google <comma> translated  it  into  italian <comma> went  back  into  italian  google <period> fifteen  minutes  later  -- <period> next  question <comma> where  is  calcutta <questionmark> this  one <comma> they  took  only  10  minutes <period> i  tried  a  really  hard  one  then <period> who  was  pythagoras <comma> and  what  did  he  do <questionmark> there  was  silence  for  a  while <comma> then  they  said <comma> you've  spelled  it  wrong <period> it  's  pitagora <period> and  then <comma> in  20  minutes <comma> the  right-angled  triangles  began  to  appear  on  the  screens <period> this  sent  shivers  up  my  spine <period> these  are  10  year-olds <period> text <comma> in  another  30  minutes  they  would  reach  the  theory  of  relativity <period> and  then <questionmark> sm <comma> so  you  know  what  's  happened <questionmark> i  think  we've  just  stumbled  across  a  self-organizing  system <period> a  self-organizing  system  is  one  where  a  structure  appears  without  explicit  intervention  from  the  outside <period> self-organizing  systems  also  always  show  emergence <comma> which  is  that  the  system  starts  to  do  things <comma> which  it  was  never  designed  for <period> which  is  why  you  react  the  way  you  do <comma> because  it  looks  impossible <period> i  think  i  can  make  a  guess  now <comma> education  is  self-organizing  system <comma> where  learning  is  an  emergent  phenomenon <period> it  'll  take  a  few  years  to  prove  it <comma> experimentally <comma> but  i  'm  going  to  try <period> but  in  the  meanwhile <comma> there  is  a  method  available <period> one  billion  children <comma> we  need  100  million  mediators <comma> there  are  many  more  than  that  on  the  planet <comma> 10  million  soles <comma> 180  billion  dollars  and  10  years <period> we  could  change  everything <period> thanks <period> i  'm  very  fortunate  to  be  here <period> i  feel  so  fortunate <period> i've  been  so  impressed  by  the  kindness  expressed  to  me <period> i  called  my  wife  leslie <comma> and  i  said <comma> you  know <comma> there  's  so  many  good  people  trying  to  do  so  much  good <period> it  feels  like  i've  landed  in  a  colony  of  angels <period> it  's  a  true  feeling <period> but  let  me  get  to  the  talk <comma> i  see  the  clock  is  running <period> i  'm  a  public  school  teacher <comma> and  i  just  want  to  share  a  story  of  my  superintendent <period> her  name  is  pam  moran  in  albemarle  county <comma> virginia <comma> the  foothills  of  the  blue  ridge  mountains <period> and  she  's  a  very  high-tech  superintendent <period> she  uses  smart  boards <comma> she  blogs <comma> she  tweets <comma> she  does  facebook <comma> she  does  all  this  sort  of  high-tech  stuff <period> she  's  a  technology  leader  and  instructional  leader <period> but  in  her  office <comma> there  's  this  old  wooden <comma> weather-worn  table <comma> kitchen  table <comma> peeling  green  paint <comma> it  's  kind  of  rickety <period> and  i  said <comma> pam <comma> you  're  such  a  modern <comma> cutting-edge  person <period> why  is  this  old  table  in  your  office <questionmark> and  she  told  me <comma> she  said <comma> you  know <comma> i  grew  up  in  southwestern  virginia <comma> in  the  coal  mines  and  the  farmlands  of  rural  virginia <comma> and  this  table  was  in  my  grandfather  's  kitchen <period> and  we'd  come  in  from  playing <comma> he'd  come  in  from  plowing  and  working <comma> and  we'd  sit  around  that  table  every  night <period> and  as  i  grew  up <comma> i  heard  so  much  knowledge  and  so  many  insights  and  so  much  wisdom  come  out  around  this  table <comma> i  began  to  call  it  the  wisdom  table <period> and  when  he  passed  on <comma> i  took  this  table  with  me  and  brought  it  to  my  office <comma> and  it  reminds  me  of  him <period> it  reminds  me  of  what  goes  on  around  an  empty  space  sometimes <period> the  project  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about  is  called  the  world  peace  game <comma> and  essentially  it  is  also  an  empty  space <period> and  i'd  like  to  think  of  it  as  a  21st  century  wisdom  table <comma> really <period> it  all  started  back  in  1977 <period> i  was  a  young  man <comma> and  i  had  been  dropping  in  and  out  of  college <period> and  my  parents  were  very  patient <comma> but  i  had  been  doing  intermittent  sojourns  to  india  on  a  mystical  quest <period> and  i  remember  the  last  time  i  came  back  from  india <comma> in  my  long  white  flowing  robes  and  my  big  beard  and  my  john  lennon  glasses <comma> and  i  said  to  my  father <comma> dad <comma> i  think  i've  just  about  found  spiritual  enlightenment <period> he  said <comma> well  there  's  one  more  thing  you  need  to  find <period> i  said <comma> what  is  that <comma> dad  a  job <period> and  so  they  pleaded  with  me  to  get  a  degree  in  something <period> so  i  got  a  degree  and  it  turned  out  to  be  education <period> it  was  an  experimental  education  program <period> it  could  have  been  dentistry <comma> but  the  word  experimental  was  in  it <comma> and  so  that  's  what  i  had  to  go  for <period> and  i  went  in  for  a  job  interview  in  the  richmond  public  schools  in  virginia <comma> the  capital  city <comma> bought  a  three-piece  suit <comma> my  concession  to  convention <comma> kept  my  long  beard  and  my  afro  and  my  platform  shoes <comma> at  the  time  it  was  the  70s <comma> and  i  walked  in <comma> and  i  sat  down  and  had  an  interview <period> and  i  guess  they  were  hard  up  for  teachers  because  the  supervisor <comma> her  name  was  anna  aro <comma> said  i  had  the  job  teaching  gifted  children <period> and  i  was  so  shocked <comma> so  stunned <comma> i  got  up  and  said <comma> well <comma> thank  you <comma> but  what  do  i  do <questionmark> gifted  education  had  n't  really  taken  hold  too  much <period> there  were  n't  really  many  materials  or  things  to  use <period> and  i  said <comma> what  do  i  do <questionmark> and  her  answer  shocked  me <period> it  stunned  me <period> her  answer  set  the  template  for  the  entire  career  i  was  to  have  after  that <period> she  said <comma> what  do  you  want  to  do <questionmark> and  that  question  cleared  the  space <period> there  was  no  program  directive <comma> no  manual  to  follow <comma> no  standards  in  gifted  education  in  that  way <period> and  she  cleared  such  a  space  that  i  endeavored  from  then  on  to  clear  a  space  for  my  students <comma> an  empty  space <comma> whereby  they  could  create  and  make  meaning  out  of  their  own  understanding <period> so  this  happened  in  1978 <comma> and  i  was  teaching  many  years  later <comma> and  a  friend  of  mine  introduced  me  to  a  young  filmmaker <period> his  name  is  chris  farina <period> chris  farina  is  here  today  at  his  own  cost <period> chris <comma> could  you  stand  up  and  let  them  see  you <comma> a  young <comma> visionary  filmmaker  who  's  made  a  film <period> this  film  is  called  world  peace  and  other  4th  grade  achievements <period> he  proposed  the  film  to  me <comma> it  's  a  great  title <period> he  proposed  the  film  to  me <comma> and  i  said <comma> yeah <comma> maybe  it  'll  be  on  local  tv <comma> and  we  can  say  hi  to  our  friends <period> but  the  film  has  really  gone  places <period> now  it  's  still  in  debt <comma> but  chris  has  managed <comma> through  his  own  sacrifice <comma> to  get  this  film  out <period> so  we  made  a  film  and  it  turns  out  to  be  more  than  a  story  about  me <comma> more  than  a  story  about  one  teacher <period> it  's  a  story  that  's  a  testament  to  teaching  and  teachers <period> and  it  's  a  beautiful  thing <period> and  the  strange  thing  is <comma> when  i  watch  the  film <comma> i  have  the  eerie  sensation  of  seeing  it <comma> i  saw  myself  literally  disappear <period> what  i  saw  was  my  teachers  coming  through  me <period> i  saw  my  geometry  teacher  in  high  school <comma> mr.  rucell  's  wry  smile  under  his  handlebar  mustache <period> that  's  the  smile  i  use <comma> that  's  his  smile <period> i  saw  jan  polo  's  flashing  eyes <period> and  they  were  n't  flashing  in  anger <comma> they  were  flashing  in  love <comma> intense  love  for  her  students <period> and  i  have  that  kind  of  flash  sometimes <period> and  i  saw  miss  ethel  j <period> banks  who  wore  pearls  and  high-heels  to  elementary  school  every  day <period> and  you  know <comma> she  had  that  old-school  teacher  stare <period> you  know  the  one <period> and  i  'm  not  even  talking  about  you  behind  me <comma> because  i've  got  eyes  in  the  back  of  my  head <period> you  know  that  teacher <questionmark> i  did  n't  use  that  stare  very  often <comma> but  i  do  have  it  in  my  repertoire <period> and  miss  banks  was  there  as  a  great  mentor  for  me <period> and  then  i  saw  my  own  parents <comma> my  first  teachers <period> my  father <comma> very  inventive <comma> spatial  thinker <period> that  's  my  brother  malcolm  there  on  the  right <period> and  my  mother <comma> who  taught  me  in  fourth  grade  in  segregated  schools  in  virginia <comma> who  was  my  inspiration <period> and  really <comma> i  feel  as  though <comma> when  i  see  the  film <comma> i  have  a  gesture  she  does <comma> like  this <comma> i  feel  like  i  am  a  continuation  of  her  gesture <period> i  am  one  of  her  teaching  gestures <period> and  the  beautiful  thing  was <comma> i  got  to  teach  my  daughter  in  elementary  school <comma> madeline <period> and  so  that  gesture  of  my  mother  's  continues  through  many  generations <period> it  's  an  amazing  feeling  to  have  that  lineage <period> and  so  i  'm  here  standing  on  the  shoulders  of  many  people <period> i  'm  not  here  alone <period> there  are  many  people  on  this  stage  right  now <period> and  so  this  world  peace  game  i'd  like  to  tell  you  about <period> it  started  out  like  this <comma> it  's  just  a  four-foot  by  five-foot  plywood  board  in  an  inner-city  urban  school <comma> 1978 <period> i  was  creating  a  lesson  for  students  on  africa <period> we  put  all  the  problems  of  the  world  there <comma> and  i  thought <comma> let  's  let  them  solve  it <period> i  did  n't  want  to  lecture  or  have  just  book  reading <period> i  wanted  to  have  them  be  immersed  and  learn  the  feeling  of  learning  through  their  bodies <period> so  i  thought <comma> well  they  like  to  play  games <period> i  'll  make  something <comma> i  did  n't  say  interactive <period> we  did  n't  have  that  term  in  1978 <comma> but  something  interactive <period> and  so  we  made  the  game <comma> and  it  has  since  evolved  to  a  four-foot  by  four-foot  by  four-foot  plexiglass  structure <period> and  it  has  four  plexiglass  layers <period> there  's  an  outer  space  layer  with  black  holes  and  satellites  and  research  satellites  and  asteroid  mining <period> there  's  an  air  and  space  level  with  clouds  that  are  big  puffs  of  cotton  we  push  around  and  territorial  air  spaces  and  air  forces <comma> a  ground  and  sea  level  with  thousands  of  game  pieces  on  it <comma> even  an  undersea  level  with  submarines  and  undersea  mining <period> there  are  four  countries  around  the  board <period> the  kids  make  up  the  names  of  the  countries <comma> some  are  rich <period> some  are  poor <period> they  have  different  assets <comma> commercial  and  military <period> and  each  country  has  a  cabinet <period> there  's  a  prime  minister <comma> secretary  of  state <comma> minister  of  defense  and  a  cfo <comma> or  comptroller <period> i  choose  the  prime  minister  based  on  my  relationship  with  them <period> i  offer  them  the  job <comma> they  can  turn  it  down <comma> and  then  they  choose  their  own  cabinet <period> there  's  a  world  bank <comma> arms  dealers  and  a  united  nations <period> there  's  also  a  weather  goddess  who  controls  a  random  stock  market  and  random  weather <period> that  's  not  all <period> and  then  there  's  a  13-page  crisis  document  with  50  interlocking  problems <period> so  that <comma> if  one  thing  changes <comma> everything  else  changes <period> i  throw  them  into  this  complex  matrix <comma> and  they  trust  me  because  we  have  a  deep <comma> rich  relationship  together <period> and  so  with  all  these  crises <comma> we  have <comma> let  's  see <comma> ethnic  and  minority  tensions <period> we  have  chemical  and  nuclear  spills <comma> nuclear  proliferation <period> there  's  oil  spills <comma> environmental  disasters <comma> water  rights  disputes <comma> breakaway  republics <comma> famine <comma> endangered  species  and  global  warming <period> if  al  gore  is  here <comma> i  'm  going  to  send  my  fourth-graders  from  agnor-hurt  and  venable  schools  to  you  because  they  solved  global  warming  in  a  week <period> and  they've  done  it  several  times  too <period> so  i  also  have  in  the  game  a  saboteur <comma> some  child <comma> it  's  basically  a  troublemaker <comma> and  i  have  my  troublemaker  put  to  use  because  they <comma> on  the  surface <comma> are  trying  to  save  the  world  and  their  position  in  the  game <period> but  they  're  also  trying  to  undermine  everything  in  the  game <period> and  they  do  it  secretly  through  misinformation  and  ambiguities  and  irrelevancies <comma> trying  to  cause  everyone  to  think  more  deeply <period> the  saboteur  is  there <comma> and  we  also  read  from  sun  tzu  's  the  art  of  war  fourth-graders  understand  it <comma> nine  years  old <comma> and  they  handle  that  and  use  that  to  understand  how  to <comma> not  follow <comma> at  first  they  do <comma> the  paths  to  power  and  destruction <comma> the  path  to  war <period> they  learn  to  overlook  short-sighted  reactions  and  impulsive  thinking <comma> to  think  in  a  long-term <comma> more  consequential  way <period> stewart  brand  is  here <comma> and  one  of  the  ideas  for  this  game  came  from  him  with  a  coevolution  quarterly  article  on  a  peace  force <period> and  in  the  game <comma> sometimes  students  actually  form  a  peace  force <period> i  'm  just  a  clock  watcher <period> i  'm  just  a  clarifier <period> i  'm  just  a  facilitator <period> the  students  run  the  game <period> i  have  no  chance  to  make  any  policy  whatsoever  once  they  start  playing <period> so  i  'll  just  share  with  you <period> boy <comma> the  world  peace  game  is  serious <period> you  're  actually  getting  taught  something  like  how  to  take  care  of  the  world <period> see <comma> mr.  hunter  is  doing  that  because  he  says  his  time  has  messed  up  a  lot <comma> and  he  's  trying  to  tell  us  how  to  fix  that  problem <period> john  hunter <comma> i  offered  them  a <comma> actually <comma> i  cannot  tell  them  anything  because  i  do  n't  know  the  answer <period> and  i  admit  the  truth  to  them  right  up  front <comma> i  do  n't  know <period> and  because  i  do  n't  know <comma> they've  got  to  dig  up  the  answer <period> and  so  i  apologize  to  them  as  well <period> i  say <comma> i  'm  so  sorry <comma> boys  and  girls <comma> but  the  truth  is  we  have  left  this  world  to  you  in  such  a  sad  and  terrible  shape <comma> and  we  hope  you  can  fix  it  for  us <comma> and  maybe  this  game  will  help  you  learn  how  to  do  it <period> it  's  a  sincere  apology <comma> and  they  take  it  very  seriously <period> now  you  may  be  wondering  what  all  this  complexity  looks  like <period> well  when  we  have  the  game  start <comma> here  's  what  you  see <period> jh <comma> all  right <comma> we  're  going  into  negotiations  as  of  now <period> go <period> jh <comma> my  question  to  you  is <comma> who  's  in  charge  of  that  classroom <questionmark> it  's  a  serious  question <comma> who  is  really  in  charge <questionmark> i've  learned  to  cede  control  of  the  classroom  over  to  the  students  over  time <period> there  's  a  trust  and  an  understanding  and  a  dedication  to  an  ideal  that  i  simply  do  n't  have  to  do  what  i  thought  i  had  to  do  as  a  beginning  teacher <comma> control  every  conversation  and  response  in  the  classroom <period> it  's  impossible <period> their  collective  wisdom  is  much  greater  than  mine <comma> and  i  admit  it  to  them  openly <period> so  i  'll  just  share  with  you  some  stories  very  quickly  of  some  magical  things  that  have  happened <period> in  this  game  we  had  a  little  girl <comma> and  she  was  the  defense  minister  of  the  poorest  nation <period> and  the  defense  minister <comma> she  had  the  tank  corps  and  air  force  and  so  forth <period> and  she  was  next  door  to  a  very  wealthy <comma> oil-rich  neighbor <period> without  provocation <comma> suddenly  she  attacked <comma> against  her  prime  minister  's  orders <comma> the  next-door  neighbor  's  oil  fields <period> she  marched  into  the  oil  field  reserves <comma> surrounded  it <comma> without  firing  a  shot <comma> and  secured  it  and  held  it <period> and  that  neighbor  was  unable  to  conduct  any  military  operations  because  their  fuel  supply  was  locked  up <period> we  were  all  upset  with  her <comma> why  are  you  doing  this <questionmark> this  is  the  world  peace  game <period> what  is  wrong  with  you <questionmark> this  was  a  little  girl  and <comma> at  nine  years  old <comma> she  held  her  pieces  and  said <comma> i  know  what  i  'm  doing <period> to  her  girlfriends  she  said  that <period> that  's  a  breach  there <period> and  we  learned  in  this <comma> you  do  n't  really  ever  want  to  cross  a  nine  year-old  girl  with  tanks <period> they  are  the  toughest  opponents <period> and  we  were  very  upset <period> i  thought  i  was  failing  as  a  teacher <period> why  would  she  do  this <questionmark> but  come  to  find  out <comma> a  few  game  days  later <comma> and  there  are  turns  where  we  take  negotiation  from  a  team <comma> actually  there  's  a  negotiation  period  with  all  teams <comma> and  each  team  takes  a  turn <comma> then  we  go  back  in  negotiation <comma> around  and  around <comma> so  each  turn  around  is  one  game  day <period> so  a  few  game  days  later  it  came  to  light  that  we  found  out  this  major  country  was  planning  a  military  offensive  to  dominate  the  entire  world <period> had  they  had  their  fuel  supplies <comma> they  would  have  done  it <period> she  was  able  to  see  the  vectors  and  trend  lines  and  intentions  long  before  any  of  us  and  understand  what  was  going  to  happen  and  made  a  philosophical  decision  to  attack  in  a  peace  game <period> now  she  used  a  small  war  to  avert  a  larger  war <comma> so  we  stopped  and  had  a  very  good  philosophical  discussion  about  whether  that  was  right <comma> conditional  good <comma> or  not  right <period> that  's  the  kind  of  thinking  that  we  put  them  in <comma> the  situations <period> i  could  not  have  designed  that  in  teaching  it <period> it  came  about  spontaneously  through  their  collective  wisdom <period> another  example <comma> a  beautiful  thing  happened <period> we  have  a  letter  in  the  game <period> if  you  're  a  military  commander  and  you  wage  troops <comma> the  little  plastic  toys  on  the  board <comma> and  you  lose  them <comma> i  put  in  a  letter <period> you  have  to  write  a  letter  to  their  parents <comma> the  fictional  parents  of  your  fictional  troops <comma> explaining  what  happened  and  offering  your  condolences <period> so  you  have  a  little  bit  more  thought  before  you  commit  to  combat <period> and  so  we  had  this  situation  come  up <comma> last  summer  actually <comma> at  agnor-hurt  school  in  albemarle  county <comma> and  one  of  our  military  commanders  got  up  to  read  that  letter  and  one  of  the  other  kids  said <comma> mr.  hunter <comma> let  's  ask <comma> there  's  a  parent  over  there <period> there  was  a  parent  visiting  that  day <comma> just  sitting  in  the  back  of  the  room <period> let  's  ask  that  mom  to  read  the  letter <period> it  'll  be  more  realer  if  she  reads  it <period> so  we  did <comma> we  asked  her <comma> and  she  gamely  picked  up  the  letter <period> sure  she  started  reading <period> she  read  one  sentence <period> she  read  two  sentences <period> by  the  third  sentence <comma> she  was  in  tears <period> i  was  in  tears <period> everybody  understood  that  when  we  lose  somebody <comma> the  winners  are  not  gloating <period> we  all  lose <period> and  it  was  an  amazing  occurrence  and  an  amazing  understanding <period> i  'll  show  you  what  my  friend  david  says  about  this <period> he  's  been  in  many  battles <period> david <comma> we've  really  had  enough  of  people  attacking <period> i  mean <comma> we've  been  lucky  most  of  the  time <period> but  now  i  'm  feeling  really  weird  because  i  'm  living  what  sun  tzu  said  one  week <period> one  week  he  said <comma> those  who  go  into  battle  and  win  will  want  to  go  back <comma> and  those  who  lose  in  battle  will  want  to  go  back  and  win <period> and  so  i've  been  winning  battles <comma> so  i  'm  going  into  battles <comma> more  battles <period> and  i  think  it  's  sort  of  weird  to  be  living  what  sun  tzu  said <period> jh <comma> i  get  chills  every  time  i  see  that <period> that  's  the  kind  of  engagement  you  want  to  have  happen <period> and  i  cannot  design  that <comma> i  cannot  plan  that <comma> and  i  cannot  even  test  that <period> but  it  's  self-evident  assessment <period> we  know  that  's  an  authentic  assessment  of  learning <period> we  have  a  lot  of  data <comma> but  i  think  sometimes  we  go  beyond  data  with  the  real  truth  of  what  's  going  on <period> so  i  'll  just  share  a  third  story <period> this  is  about  my  friend  brennan <period> we  had  played  the  game  one  session  after  school  for  many  weeks <comma> about  seven  weeks <comma> and  we  had  essentially  solved  all  50  of  the  interlocking  crises <period> the  way  the  game  is  won  is  all  50  problems  have  to  be  solved  and  every  country  's  asset  value  has  to  be  increased  above  its  starting  point <period> some  are  poor <comma> some  are  wealthy <period> there  are  billions <period> the  world  bank  president  was  a  third-grader  one  time <period> he  says <comma> how  many  zeros  in  a  trillion <questionmark> i've  got  to  calculate  that  right  away <period> but  he  was  setting  fiscal  policy  in  that  game  for  high  school  players  who  were  playing  with  him <period> so  the  team  that  was  the  poorest  had  gotten  even  poorer <period> there  was  no  way  they  could  win <period> and  we  were  approaching  four  o'clock <comma> our  cut-off  time <comma> there  was  about  a  minute  left <comma> and  despair  just  settled  over  the  room <period> i  thought <comma> i  'm  failing  as  a  teacher <period> i  should  have  gotten  it  so  they  could  have  won <period> they  should  n't  be  failing  like  this <period> i've  failed  them <period> and  i  was  just  feeling  so  sad  and  dejected <period> and  suddenly <comma> brennan  walked  over  to  my  chair  and  he  grabbed  the  bell <comma> the  bell  i  ring  to  signal  a  change  or  a  reconvening  of  cabinets <comma> and  he  ran  back  to  his  seat <comma> rang  the  bell <period> everybody  ran  to  his  chair <comma> there  was  screaming <period> there  was  yelling <comma> waving  of  their  dossiers <period> they  get  these  dossiers  full  of  secret  documents <period> they  were  gesticulating <period> they  were  running  around <period> i  did  n't  know  what  they  were  doing <period> i'd  lost  control  of  my  classroom <period> principal  walks  in <comma> i  'm  out  of  a  job <period> the  parents  were  looking  in  the  window <period> and  brennan  runs  back  to  his  seat <period> everybody  runs  back  to  their  seat <period> he  rings  the  bell  again <period> he  says <comma> we  have <comma> and  there  's  12  seconds  left  on  the  clock <comma> we  have <comma> all  nations <comma> pooled  all  our  funds  together <period> and  we've  got  600  billion  dollars <period> we  're  going  to  offer  it  as  a  donation  to  this  poor  country <period> and  if  they  accept  it <comma> it  'll  raise  their  asset  value  and  we  can  win  the  game <period> will  you  accept  it <questionmark> and  there  are  three  seconds  left  on  the  clock <period> everybody  looks  at  this  prime  minister  of  that  country <comma> and  he  says <comma> yes <period> and  the  game  is  won <period> spontaneous  compassion  that  could  not  be  planned  for <comma> that  was  unexpected  and  unpredictable <period> every  game  we  play  is  different <period> some  games  are  more  about  social  issues <comma> some  are  more  about  economic  issues <period> some  games  are  more  about  warfare <period> but  i  do  n't  try  to  deny  them  that  reality  of  being  human <period> i  allow  them  to  go  there  and <comma> through  their  own  experience <comma> learn <comma> in  a  bloodless  way <comma> how  not  to  do  what  they  consider  to  be  the  wrong  thing <period> and  they  find  out  what  is  right  their  own  way <comma> their  own  selves <period> and  so  in  this  game <comma> i've  learned  so  much  from  it <comma> but  i  would  say  that  if  only  they  could  pick  up  a  critical  thinking  tool  or  creative  thinking  tool  from  this  game  and  leverage  something  good  for  the  world <comma> they  may  save  us  all <period> if  only <period> and  on  behalf  of  all  of  my  teachers  on  whose  shoulders  i  'm  standing <comma> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> we  live  in  difficult  and  challenging  economic  times <comma> of  course <period> and  one  of  the  first  victims  of  difficult  economic  times <comma> i  think <comma> is  public  spending  of  any  kind <comma> but  certainly  in  the  firing  line  at  the  moment  is  public  spending  for  science <comma> and  particularly  curiosity-led  science  and  exploration <period> so  i  want  to  try  and  convince  you  in  about  15  minutes  that  that  's  a  ridiculous  and  ludicrous  thing  to  do <period> but  i  think  to  set  the  scene <comma> i  want  to  show <comma> the  next  slide  is  not  my  attempt  to  show  the  worst  ted  slide  in  the  history  of  ted <comma> but  it  is  a  bit  of  a  mess <period> but  actually <comma> it  's  not  my  fault <period> it  's  from  the  guardian  newspaper <period> and  it  's  actually  a  beautiful  demonstration  of  how  much  science  costs <period> because <comma> if  i  'm  going  to  make  the  case  for  continuing  to  spend  on  curiosity-driven  science  and  exploration <comma> i  should  tell  you  how  much  it  costs <period> so  this  is  a  game  called  spot  the  science  budgets <period> this  is  the  uk <period> government  spend <period> you  see  there <comma> it  's  about  620  billion  a  year <period> the  science  budget  is  actually <comma> if  you  look  to  your  left <comma> there  's  a  purple  set  of  blobs  and  then  yellow  set  of  blobs <period> and  it  's  one  of  the  yellow  set  of  blobs  around  the  big  yellow  blob <period> it  's  about  33  billion  pounds  per  year  out  of  620  billion <period> that  funds  everything  in  the  uk <period> from  medical  research <comma> space  exploration <comma> where  i  work <comma> at  cern  in  geneva <comma> particle  physics <comma> engineering <comma> even  arts  and  humanities <comma> funded  from  the  science  budget <comma> which  is  that  33  billion <comma> that  little <comma> tiny  yellow  blob  around  the  orange  blob  at  the  top  left  of  the  screen <period> so  that  's  what  we  're  arguing  about <period> that  percentage <comma> by  the  way <comma> is  about  the  same  in  the  us <period> and  germany  and  france <period> r&ampd  in  total  in  the  economy <comma> publicly  funded <comma> is  about  06  percent  of  gdp <period> so  that  's  what  we  're  arguing  about <period> the  first  thing  i  want  to  say <comma> and  this  is  straight  from  wonders  of  the  solar  system <comma> is  that  our  exploration  of  the  solar  system  and  the  universe  has  shown  us  that  it  is  indescribably  beautiful <period> this  is  a  picture  that  actually  was  sent  back  by  the  cassini  space  probe  around  saturn <comma> after  we'd  finished  filming  wonders  of  the  solar  system <period> so  it  is  n't  in  the  series <period> it  's  of  the  moon  enceladus <period> so  that  big  sweeping <comma> white  sphere  in  the  corner  is  saturn <comma> which  is  actually  in  the  background  of  the  picture <period> and  that  crescent  there  is  the  moon  enceladus <comma> which  is  about  as  big  as  the  british  isles <period> it  's  about  500  kilometers  in  diameter <period> so <comma> tiny  moon <period> what  's  fascinating  and  beautiful <period> this  an  unprocessed  picture <comma> by  the  way <comma> i  should  say <period> it  's  black  and  white <comma> straight  from  saturnian  orbit <period> what  's  beautiful  is <comma> you  can  probably  see  on  the  limb  there  some  faint <comma> sort  of <comma> wisps  of  almost  smoke  rising  up  from  the  limb <period> this  is  how  we  visualize  that  in  wonders  of  the  solar  system <period> it  's  a  beautiful  graphic <period> what  we  found  out  were  that  those  faint  wisps  are  actually  fountains  of  ice  rising  up  from  the  surface  of  this  tiny  moon <period> that  's  fascinating  and  beautiful  in  itself <comma> but  we  think  that  the  mechanism  for  powering  those  fountains  requires  there  to  be  lakes  of  liquid  water  beneath  the  surface  of  this  moon <period> and  what  's  important  about  that  is  that <comma> on  our  planet <comma> on  earth <comma> wherever  we  find  liquid  water <comma> we  find  life <period> so <comma> to  find  strong  evidence  of  liquid <comma> pools  of  liquid <comma> beneath  the  surface  of  a  moon  750  million  miles  away  from  the  earth  is  really  quite  astounding <period> so  what  we  're  saying <comma> essentially <comma> is  maybe  that  's  a  habitat  for  life  in  the  solar  system <period> well <comma> let  me  just  say <comma> that  was  a  graphic <period> i  just  want  to  show  this  picture <period> that  's  one  more  picture  of  enceladus <period> this  is  when  cassini  flew  beneath  enceladus <period> so  it  made  a  very  low  pass <comma> just  a  few  hundred  kilometers  above  the  surface <period> and  so  this <comma> again <comma> a  real  picture  of  the  ice  fountains  rising  up  into  space <comma> absolutely  beautiful <period> but  that  's  not  the  prime  candidate  for  life  in  the  solar  system <period> that  's  probably  this  place <comma> which  is  a  moon  of  jupiter <comma> europa <period> and  again <comma> we  had  to  fly  to  the  jovian  system  to  get  any  sense  that  this  moon <comma> as  most  moons <comma> was  anything  other  than  a  dead  ball  of  rock <period> it  's  actually  an  ice  moon <period> so  what  you  're  looking  at  is  the  surface  of  the  moon  europa <comma> which  is  a  thick  sheet  of  ice <comma> probably  a  hundred  kilometers  thick <period> but  by  measuring  the  way  that  europa  interacts  with  the  magnetic  field  of  jupiter <comma> and  looking  at  how  those  cracks  in  the  ice  that  you  can  see  there  on  that  graphic  move  around <comma> we've  inferred  very  strongly  that  there  's  an  ocean  of  liquid  surrounding  the  entire  surface  of  europa <period> so  below  the  ice <comma> there  's  an  ocean  of  liquid  around  the  whole  moon <period> it  could  be  hundreds  of  kilometers  deep <comma> we  think <period> we  think  it  's  saltwater <comma> and  that  would  mean  that  there  's  more  water  on  that  moon  of  jupiter  than  there  is  in  all  the  oceans  of  the  earth  combined <period> so  that  place <comma> a  little  moon  around  jupiter <comma> is  probably  the  prime  candidate  for  finding  life  on  a  moon  or  a  body  outside  the  earth <comma> that  we  know  of <period> tremendous  and  beautiful  discovery <period> our  exploration  of  the  solar  system  has  taught  us  that  the  solar  system  is  beautiful <period> it  may  also  have  pointed  the  way  to  answering  one  of  the  most  profound  questions  that  you  can  possibly  ask <comma> which  is <comma> are  we  alone  in  the  universe <questionmark> is  there  any  other  use  to  exploration  and  science <comma> other  than  just  a  sense  of  wonder <questionmark> well <comma> there  is <period> this  is  a  very  famous  picture  taken <comma> actually <comma> on  my  first  christmas  eve <comma> december  24th <comma> 1968 <comma> when  i  was  about  eight  months  old <period> it  was  taken  by  apollo  8  as  it  went  around  the  back  of  the  moon <period> earthrise  from  apollo  8 <period> a  famous  picture <period> many  people  have  said  that  it  's  the  picture  that  saved  1968 <comma> which  was  a  turbulent  year <comma> the  student  riots  in  paris <comma> the  height  of  the  vietnam  war <period> the  reason  many  people  think  that  about  this  picture <comma> and  al  gore  has  said  it  many  times <comma> actually <comma> on  the  stage  at  ted <comma> is  that  this  picture <comma> arguably <comma> was  the  beginning  of  the  environmental  movement <period> because <comma> for  the  first  time <comma> we  saw  our  world <comma> not  as  a  solid <comma> immovable <comma> but  as  a  very  small <comma> fragile-looking  world  just  hanging  against  the  blackness  of  space <period> what  's  also  not  often  said  about  the  space  exploration <comma> about  the  apollo  program <comma> is  the  economic  contribution  it  made <period> i  mean  while  you  can  make  arguments  that  it  was  wonderful  and  a  tremendous  achievement  and  delivered  pictures  like  this <comma> it  cost  a  lot <comma> did  n't  it <questionmark> well <comma> actually <comma> many  studies  have  been  done  about  the  economic  effectiveness <comma> the  economic  impact  of  apollo <period> the  biggest  one  was  in  1975  by  chase  econometrics <period> and  it  showed  that  for  every  $1  spent  on  apollo <comma> 14  came  back  into  the  us <period> economy <period> so  the  apollo  program  paid  for  itself  in  inspiration <comma> in  engineering <comma> achievement  and <comma> i  think <comma> in  inspiring  young  scientists  and  engineers  14  times  over <period> so  exploration  can  pay  for  itself <period> what  about  scientific  discovery <questionmark> what  about  driving  innovation <questionmark> well <comma> this  looks  like  a  picture  of  virtually  nothing <period> what  it  is <comma> is  a  picture  of  the  spectrum  of  hydrogen <period> see <comma> back  in  the  1880s <comma> 1890s <comma> many  scientists <comma> many  observers <comma> looked  at  the  light  given  off  from  atoms <period> and  they  saw  strange  pictures  like  this <period> what  you  're  seeing  when  you  put  it  through  a  prism  is  that  you  heat  hydrogen  up  and  it  does  n't  just  glow  like  a  white  light <comma> it  just  emits  light  at  particular  colors <comma> a  red  one <comma> a  light  blue  one <comma> some  dark  blue  ones <period> now  that  led  to  an  understanding  of  atomic  structure  because  the  way  that  's  explained  is  atoms  are  a  single  nucleus  with  electrons  going  around  them <period> and  the  electrons  can  only  be  in  particular  places <period> and  when  they  jump  up  to  the  next  place  they  can  be <comma> and  fall  back  down  again <comma> they  emit  light  at  particular  colors <period> and  so  the  fact  that  atoms <comma> when  you  heat  them  up <comma> only  emit  light  at  very  specific  colors <comma> was  one  of  the  key  drivers  that  led  to  the  development  of  the  quantum  theory <comma> the  theory  of  the  structure  of  atoms <period> i  just  wanted  to  show  this  picture  because  this  is  remarkable <period> this  is  actually  a  picture  of  the  spectrum  of  the  sun <period> and  now <comma> this  is  a  picture  of  atoms  in  the  sun  's  atmosphere  absorbing  light <period> and  again <comma> they  only  absorb  light  at  particular  colors  when  electrons  jump  up  and  fall  down <comma> jump  up  and  fall  down <period> but  look  at  the  number  of  black  lines  in  that  spectrum <period> and  the  element  helium  was  discovered  just  by  staring  at  the  light  from  the  sun  because  some  of  those  black  lines  were  found  that  corresponded  to  no  known  element <period> and  that  's  why  helium  's  called  helium <period> it  's  called  helios <comma> helios  from  the  sun <period> now <comma> that  sounds  esoteric <comma> and  indeed  it  was  an  esoteric  pursuit <comma> but  the  quantum  theory  quickly  led  to  an  understanding  of  the  behaviors  of  electrons  in  materials  like  silicon <comma> for  example <period> the  way  that  silicon  behaves <comma> the  fact  that  you  can  build  transistors <comma> is  a  purely  quantum  phenomenon <period> so  without  that  curiosity-driven  understanding  of  the  structure  of  atoms <comma> which  led  to  this  rather  esoteric  theory <comma> quantum  mechanics <comma> then  we  would  n't  have  transistors <comma> we  would  n't  have  silicon  chips <comma> we  would  n't  have  pretty  much  the  basis  of  our  modern  economy <period> there  's  one  more <comma> i  think <comma> wonderful  twist  to  that  tale <period> in  wonders  of  the  solar  system <comma> we  kept  emphasizing  the  laws  of  physics  are  universal <period> it  's  one  of  the  most  incredible  things  about  the  physics  and  the  understanding  of  nature  that  you  get  on  earth <comma> is  you  can  transport  it <comma> not  only  to  the  planets <comma> but  to  the  most  distant  stars  and  galaxies <period> and  one  of  the  astonishing  predictions  of  quantum  mechanics <comma> just  by  looking  at  the  structure  of  atoms <comma> the  same  theory  that  describes  transistors <comma> is  that  there  can  be  no  stars  in  the  universe  that  have  reached  the  end  of  their  life  that  are  bigger  than <comma> quite  specifically <comma> 14  times  the  mass  of  the  sun <period> that  's  a  limit  imposed  on  the  mass  of  stars <period> you  can  work  it  out  on  a  piece  of  paper  in  a  laboratory <comma> get  a  telescope <comma> swing  it  to  the  sky <comma> and  you  find  that  there  are  no  dead  stars  bigger  than  14  times  the  mass  of  the  sun <period> that  's  quite  an  incredible  prediction <period> what  happens  when  you  have  a  star  that  's  right  on  the  edge  of  that  mass <questionmark> well <comma> this  is  a  picture  of  it <period> this  is  the  picture  of  a  galaxy <comma> a  common  our  garden  galaxy  with <comma> what <comma> 100  billion  stars  like  our  sun  in  it <period> it  's  just  one  of  billions  of  galaxies  in  the  universe <period> there  are  a  billion  stars  in  the  galactic  core <comma> which  is  why  it  's  shining  out  so  brightly <period> this  is  about  50  million  light  years  away <comma> so  one  of  our  neighboring  galaxies <period> but  that  bright  star  there  is  actually  one  of  the  stars  in  the  galaxy <period> so  that  star  is  also  50  million  light  years  away <period> it  's  part  of  that  galaxy <comma> and  it  's  shining  as  brightly  as  the  center  of  the  galaxy  with  a  billion  suns  in  it <period> that  's  a  type  ia  supernova  explosion <period> now  that  's  an  incredible  phenomena <comma> because  it  's  a  star  that  sits  there <period> it  's  called  a  carbon-oxygen  dwarf <period> it  sits  there  about <comma> say <comma> 13  times  the  mass  of  the  sun <period> and  it  has  a  binary  companion  that  goes  around  it <comma> so  a  big  star <comma> a  big  ball  of  gas <period> and  what  it  does  is  it  sucks  gas  off  its  companion  star <comma> until  it  gets  to  this  limit  called  the  chandrasekhar  limit <comma> and  then  it  explodes <period> and  it  explodes <comma> and  it  shines  as  brightly  as  a  billion  suns  for  about  two  weeks <comma> and  releases <comma> not  only  energy <comma> but  a  huge  amount  of  chemical  elements  into  the  universe <period> in  fact <comma> that  one  is  a  carbon-oxygen  dwarf <period> now <comma> there  was  no  carbon  and  oxygen  in  the  universe  at  the  big  bang <period> and  there  was  no  carbon  and  oxygen  in  the  universe  throughout  the  first  generation  of  stars <period> it  was  made  in  stars  like  that <comma> locked  away  and  then  returned  to  the  universe  in  explosions  like  that  in  order  to  recondense  into  planets <comma> stars <comma> new  solar  systems  and <comma> indeed <comma> people  like  us <period> i  think  that  's  a  remarkable  demonstration  of  the  power  and  beauty  and  universality  of  the  laws  of  physics <comma> because  we  understand  that  process <comma> because  we  understand  the  structure  of  atoms  here  on  earth <period> this  is  a  beautiful  quote  that  i  found <comma> we  're  talking  about  serendipity  there <comma> from  alexander  fleming: <period> when  i  woke  up  just  after  dawn  on  september  28 <comma> 1928 <comma> i  certainly  did  n't  plan  to  revolutionize  all  medicine  by  discovering  the  world  's  first  antibiotic <period> now <comma> the  explorers  of  the  world  of  the  atom  did  not  intend  to  invent  the  transistor <period> and  they  certainly  did  n't  intend  to  describe  the  mechanics  of  supernova  explosions <comma> which  eventually  told  us  where  the  building  blocks  of  life  were  synthesized  in  the  universe <period> so <comma> i  think  science  can  be <comma> serendipity  is  important <period> it  can  be  beautiful <period> it  can  reveal  quite  astonishing  things <period> it  can  also <comma> i  think <comma> finally  reveal  the  most  profound  ideas  to  us  about  our  place  in  the  universe  and  really  the  value  of  our  home  planet <period> this  is  a  spectacular  picture  of  our  home  planet <period> now <comma> it  does  n't  look  like  our  home  planet <period> it  looks  like  saturn  because <comma> of  course <comma> it  is <period> it  was  taken  by  the  cassini  space  probe <period> but  it  's  a  famous  picture <comma> not  because  of  the  beauty  and  majesty  of  saturn  's  rings <comma> but  actually  because  of  a  tiny <comma> faint  blob  just  hanging  underneath  one  of  the  rings <period> and  if  i  blow  it  up  there <comma> you  see  it <period> it  looks  like  a  moon <comma> but  in  fact <comma> it  's  a  picture  of  earth <period> it  was  a  picture  of  earth  captured  in  that  frame  of  saturn <period> that  's  our  planet  from  750  million  miles  away <period> i  think  the  earth  has  got  a  strange  property  that  the  farther  away  you  get  from  it <comma> the  more  beautiful  it  seems <period> but  that  is  not  the  most  distant  or  most  famous  picture  of  our  planet <period> it  was  taken  by  this  thing <comma> which  is  called  the  voyager  spacecraft <period> and  that  's  a  picture  of  me  in  front  of  it  for  scale <period> the  voyager  is  a  tiny  machine <period> it  's  currently  10  billion  miles  away  from  earth <comma> transmitting  with  that  dish <comma> with  the  power  of  20  watts <comma> and  we  're  still  in  contact  with  it <period> but  it  visited  jupiter <comma> saturn <comma> uranus  and  neptune <period> and  after  it  visited  all  four  of  those  planets <comma> carl  sagan <comma> who  's  one  of  my  great  heroes <comma> had  the  wonderful  idea  of  turning  voyager  around  and  taking  a  picture  of  every  planet  it  had  visited <period> and  it  took  this  picture  of  earth <period> now  it  's  very  hard  to  see  the  earth  there <comma> it  's  called  the  pale  blue  dot  picture <comma> but  earth  is  suspended  in  that  red  shaft  of  light <period> that  's  earth  from  four  billion  miles  away <period> and  i'd  like  to  read  you  what  sagan  wrote  about  it <comma> just  to  finish <comma> because  i  cannot  say  words  as  beautiful  as  this  to  describe  what  he  saw  in  that  picture  that  he  had  taken <period> he  said <comma> consider  again  that  dot <period> that  's  here <period> that  's  home <period> that  's  us <period> on  it <comma> everyone  you  love <comma> everyone  you  know <comma> everyone  you've  ever  heard  of <comma> every  human  being  who  ever  was  lived  out  their  lives <period> the  aggregates  of  joy  and  suffering  thousands  of  confident  religions <comma> ideologies  and  economic  doctrines <comma> every  hunter  and  forager <comma> every  hero  and  coward <comma> every  creator  and  destroyer  of  civilization <comma> every  king  and  peasant <comma> every  young  couple  in  love <comma> every  mother  and  father <comma> hopeful  child <comma> inventor  and  explorer <comma> every  teacher  of  morals <comma> every  corrupt  politician <comma> every  superstar <comma> every  supreme  leader <comma> every  saint  and  sinner  in  the  history  of  our  species <comma> lived  there <comma> on  a  mote  of  dust <comma> suspended  in  a  sunbeam <period> it  's  been  said  that  astronomy  's  a  humbling  and  character-building  experience <period> there  is  perhaps  no  better  demonstration  of  the  folly  of  human  conceits  than  this  distant  image  of  our  tiny  world <period> to  me <comma> it  underscores  our  responsibility  to  deal  more  kindly  with  one  another  and  to  preserve  and  cherish  the  pale  blue  dot <comma> the  only  home  we've  ever  known <period> beautiful  words  about  the  power  of  science  and  exploration <period> the  argument  has  always  been  made <comma> and  it  will  always  be  made <comma> that  we  know  enough  about  the  universe <period> you  could  have  made  it  in  the  1920s <period> you  would  n't  have  had  penicillin <period> you  could  have  made  it  in  the  1890s <period> you  would  n't  have  the  transistor <period> and  it  's  made  today  in  these  difficult  economic  times <period> surely <comma> we  know  enough <period> we  do  n't  need  to  discover  anything  else  about  our  universe <period> let  me  leave  the  last  words  to  someone  who  's  rapidly  becoming  a  hero  of  mine <comma> humphrey  davy <comma> who  did  his  science  at  the  turn  of  the  19th  century <period> he  was  clearly  under  assault  all  the  time <period> we  know  enough  at  the  turn  of  the  19th  century <period> just  exploit  it <period> just  build  things <period> he  said  this <comma> he  said <comma> nothing  is  more  fatal  to  the  progress  of  the  human  mind  than  to  presume  that  our  views  of  science  are  ultimate <comma> that  our  triumphs  are  complete <comma> that  there  are  no  mysteries  in  nature <comma> and  that  there  are  no  new  worlds  to  conquer <period> thank  you <period> the  stories  we  tell  about  each  other  matter  very  much <period> the  stories  we  tell  ourselves  about  our  own  lives  matter <period> and  most  of  all <comma> i  think  the  way  that  we  participate  in  each  other  's  stories  is  of  deep  importance <period> i  was  six  years  old  when  i  first  heard  stories  about  the  poor <period> now  i  did  n't  hear  those  stories  from  the  poor  themselves <comma> i  heard  them  from  my  sunday  school  teacher  and  jesus <comma> kind  of  via  my  sunday  school  teacher <period> i  remember  learning  that  people  who  were  poor  needed  something  material <comma> food <comma> clothing <comma> shelter <comma> that  they  did  n't  have <period> and  i  also  was  taught <comma> coupled  with  that <comma> that  it  was  my  job <comma> this  classroom  full  of  five  and  six  year-old  children <comma> it  was  our  job <comma> apparently <comma> to  help <period> this  is  what  jesus  asked  of  us <period> and  then  he  said <comma> what  you  do  for  the  least  of  these <comma> you  do  for  me  now  i  was  pretty  psyched <period> i  was  very  eager  to  be  useful  in  the  world  -- <period> i  think  we  all  have  that  feeling <period> and  also <comma> it  was  kind  of  interesting  that  god  needed  help <period> that  was  news  to  me <comma> and  it  felt  like  it  was  a  very  important  thing  to  get  to  participate  in <period> but  i  also  learned  very  soon  thereafter  that  jesus  also  said <comma> and  i  'm  paraphrasing <comma> the  poor  would  always  be  with  us <period> this  frustrated  and  confused  me <period> i  felt  like  i  had  been  just  given  a  homework  assignment  that  i  had  to  do <comma> and  i  was  excited  to  do <comma> but  no  matter  what  i  would  do <comma> i  would  fail <period> so  i  felt  confused <comma> a  little  bit  frustrated  and  angry <comma> like  maybe  i'd  misunderstood  something  here <period> and  i  felt  overwhelmed <period> and  for  the  first  time <comma> i  began  to  fear  this  group  of  people  and  to  feel  negative  emotion  towards  a  whole  group  of  people <period> i  imagined  in  my  head <comma> a  kind  of  long  line  of  individuals  that  were  never  going  away <comma> that  would  always  be  with  us <period> they  were  always  going  to  ask  me  to  help  them  and  give  them  things <comma> which  i  was  excited  to  do <comma> but  i  did  n't  know  how  it  was  going  to  work <period> and  i  did  n't  know  what  would  happen  when  i  ran  out  of  things  to  give <comma> especially  if  the  problem  was  never  going  away <period> in  the  years  following <comma> the  other  stories  i  heard  about  the  poor  growing  up  were  no  more  positive <period> for  example <comma> i  saw  pictures  and  images  frequently  of  sadness  and  suffering <period> i  heard  about  things  that  were  going  wrong  in  the  lives  of  the  poor <period> i  heard  about  disease <comma> i  heard  about  war  -- <period> they  always  seemed  to  be  kind  of  related <period> and  in  general <comma> i  got  this  sort  of  idea  that  the  poor  in  the  world  lived  lives  that  were  wrought  with  suffering  and  sadness <comma> devastation <comma> hopelessness <period> and  after  a  while <comma> i  developed  what  i  think  many  of  us  do <comma> is  this  predictable  response <comma> where  i  started  to  feel  bad  every  time  i  heard  about  them <period> i  started  to  feel  guilty  for  my  own  relative  wealth <comma> because  i  was  n't  doing  more <comma> apparently <comma> to  make  things  better <period> and  i  even  felt  a  sense  of  shame  because  of  that <period> and  so  naturally <comma> i  started  to  distance  myself <period> i  stopped  listening  to  their  stories  and  i  stopped  expecting  things  to  really  change <period> now  i  still  gave <comma> on  the  outside  it  looked  like  i  was  still  quite  involved <period> i  gave  of  my  time  and  my  money <period> i  gave  when  solutions  were  on  sale <period> the  cost  of  a  cup  of  coffee  can  save  a  child  's  life <comma> right <period> i  mean  who  can  argue  with  that <questionmark> i  gave  when  i  was  cornered <comma> when  it  was  difficult  to  avoid <period> and  i  gave <comma> in  general <comma> when  the  negative  emotions  built  up  enough  that  i  gave  to  relieve  my  own  suffering <comma> not  someone  else  's <period> the  truth  be  told <comma> i  was  giving  out  of  that  place <comma> not  out  of  a  genuine  place  of  hope  and  excitement  to  help  and  of  generosity <period> it  became  a  transaction  for  me <comma> became  sort  of  a  trade <period> i  was  purchasing  something  -- <period> i  was  buying  my  right  to  go  on  with  my  day  and  not  necessarily  be  bothered  by  this  bad  news <period> and  i  think  the  way  that  we  go  through  that  sometimes  disembody  a  group  of  people <comma> individuals  out  there  in  the  world <period> and  it  can  also  turn  into  a  commodity <period> which  is  a  very  scary  thing <period> so  as  i  did  this <comma> and  as  i  think  many  of  us  do  this <comma> we  kind  of  buy  our  distance <comma> we  kind  of  buy  our  right  to  go  on  with  our  day <period> i  think  that  exchange  can  actually  get  in  the  way  of  the  very  thing  that  we  want  most <period> it  can  get  in  the  way  of  our  desire  to  really  be  meaningful  and  useful  in  another  person  's  life  and <comma> in  short  to  love <period> thankfully <comma> a  few  years  ago <comma> things  shifted  for  me  because  i  heard  this  gentleman  speak <comma> dr.  muhammad  yunus <period> i  know  many  in  the  room  probably  know  exactly  who  he  is <comma> but  to  give  the  shorthand  version  for  any  who  have  not  heard  him  speak <comma> dr.  yunus  won  the  nobel  peace  prize  a  few  years  ago  for  his  work  pioneering  modern  microfinance <period> when  i  heard  him  speak <comma> it  was  three  years  before  that <period> but  basically <comma> microfinance <comma> if  this  is  new  to  you  as  well <comma> think  of  that  as  financial  services  for  the  poor <period> think  of  all  the  things  you  get  at  your  bank  and  imagine  those  products  and  services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  someone  living  on  a  few  dollars  a  day <period> dr.  yunus  shared  his  story <comma> explaining  what  that  was <comma> and  what  he  had  done  with  his  grameen  bank <period> he  also  talked  about <comma> in  particular <comma> microlending <period> which  is  a  tiny  loan  that  could  help  someone  start  or  grow  a  business <period> now <comma> when  i  heard  him  speak <comma> it  was  exciting  for  a  number  of  reasons <period> first  and  foremost <comma> i  learned  about  this  new  method  of  change  in  the  world  that <comma> for  once <comma> showed  me <comma> maybe <comma> a  way  to  interact  with  someone  and  to  give <comma> to  share  of  a  resource  in  a  way  that  was  n't  weird  and  did  n't  make  me  feel  bad  -- <period> that  was  exciting <period> but  more  importantly <comma> he  told  stories  about  the  poor  that  were  different  than  any  stories  i  had  heard  before <period> in  fact <comma> those  individuals  he  talked  about  who  were  poor  was  sort  of  a  side  note <period> he  was  talking  about  strong <comma> smart <comma> hardworking  entrepreneurs  who  woke  up  every  day  and  were  doing  things  to  make  their  lives  and  their  family  's  lives  better <period> all  they  needed  to  do  that  more  quickly  and  to  do  it  better  was  a  little  bit  of  capital <period> it  was  an  amazing  sort  of  insight  for  me <period> and  i <comma> in  fact <comma> was  so  deeply  moved  by  this <comma> it  's  hard  to  express  now  how  much  that  affected  me <comma> but  i  was  so  moved  that  i  actually  quit  my  job  a  few  weeks  later <comma> and  i  moved  to  east  africa  to  try  to  see  for  myself  what  this  was  about <period> for  the  first  time <comma> actually <comma> in  a  long  time  i  wanted  to  meet  those  individuals <comma> i  wanted  to  meet  these  entrepreneurs <comma> and  see  for  myself  what  their  lives  were  actually  about <period> so  i  spent  three  months  in  kenya <comma> uganda  and  tanzania  interviewing  entrepreneurs  that  had  received  100  dollars  to  start  or  grow  a  business <period> and  in  fact <comma> through  those  interactions <comma> for  the  first  time <comma> i  was  starting  to  get  to  be  friends  with  some  of  those  people  in  that  big  amorphous  group  out  there  that  was  supposed  to  be  far  away <period> i  was  starting  to  be  friends  and  get  to  know  their  personal  stories <period> and  over  and  over  again <comma> as  i  interviewed  them  and  spent  my  days  with  them <comma> i  did  hear  stories  of  life  change  and  amazing  little  details  of  change <period> so  i  would  hear  from  goat  herders  who  had  used  that  money  that  they  had  received  to  buy  a  few  more  goats <period> their  business  trajectory  would  change <period> they  would  make  a  little  bit  more  money <period> their  standard  of  living  would  shift  and  would  get  better <period> and  they  would  make  really  interesting  little  adjustments  in  their  lives <comma> like  they  would  start  to  send  their  children  to  school <period> they  might  be  able  to  buy  mosquito  nets <period> maybe  they  could  afford  a  lock  for  the  door  and  feel  secure <period> maybe  it  was  just  that  they  could  put  sugar  in  their  tea  and  offer  that  to  me  when  i  came  as  their  guest  and  that  made  them  feel  proud <period> but  there  were  these  beautiful  details <comma> even  if  i  talked  to  20  goat  herders  in  a  row <comma> and  some  days  that  's  what  happened <comma> these  beautiful  details  of  life  change  that  were  meaningful  to  them <period> that  was  another  thing  that  really  touched  me <period> it  was  really  humbling  to  see  for  the  first  time <comma> to  really  understand  that  even  if  i  could  have  taken  a  magic  wand  and  fixed  everything <comma> i  probably  would  have  gotten  a  lot  wrong <period> because  the  best  way  for  people  to  change  their  lives  is  for  them  to  have  control  and  to  do  that  in  a  way  that  they  believe  is  best  for  them <period> so  i  saw  that  and  it  was  very  humbling <period> anyway <comma> another  interesting  thing  happened  while  i  was  there <period> i  never  once  was  asked  for  a  donation <comma> which  had  kind  of  been  my  mode <comma> right <period> there  's  poverty <comma> you  give  money  to  help  -- <period> no  one  asked  me  for  a  donation <period> in  fact <comma> no  one  wanted  me  to  feel  bad  for  them  at  all <period> if  anything <comma> they  just  wanted  to  be  able  to  do  more  of  what  they  were  doing  already  and  to  build  on  their  own  capabilities <period> so  what  i  did  hear <comma> once  in  a  while <comma> was  that  people  wanted  a  loan <comma> i  thought  that  sounded  very  reasonable  and  really  exciting <period> and  by  the  way <comma> i  was  a  philosophy  and  poetry  major  in  school <comma> so  i  did  n't  know  the  difference  between  profit  and  revenue  when  i  went  to  east  africa <period> i  just  got  this  impression  that  the  money  would  work <period> and  my  introduction  to  business  was  in  these  $100  little  infuses  of  capital <period> and  i  learned  about  profit  and  revenue <comma> about  leverage <comma> all  sorts  of  things <comma> from  farmers <comma> from  seamstresses <comma> from  goat  herders <period> so  this  idea  that  these  new  stories  of  business  and  hope  might  be  shared  with  my  friends  and  family <comma> and  through  that <comma> maybe  we  could  get  some  of  the  money  that  they  needed  to  be  able  to  continue  their  businesses  as  loans <comma> that  's  this  little  idea  that  turned  into  kiva <period> a  few  months  later <comma> i  went  back  to  uganda  with  a  digital  camera  and  a  basic  website  that  my  partner <comma> matthew <comma> and  i  had  kind  of  built <period> and  took  pictures  of  seven  of  my  new  friends <comma> posted  their  stories <comma> these  stories  of  entrepreneurship <comma> up  on  the  website <comma> spammed  friends  and  family  and  said <comma> we  think  this  is  legal <period> have  n't  heard  back  yet  from  sec  on  all  the  details <comma> but  do  you  say <comma> do  you  want  to  help  participate  in  this <period> provide  the  money  that  they  need <questionmark> the  money  came  in  basically  overnight <period> we  sent  it  over  to  uganda <period> and  over  the  next  six  months <comma> a  beautiful  thing  happened <period> the  entrepreneurs  received  the  money <comma> they  were  paid <comma> and  their  businesses <comma> in  fact <comma> grew <comma> and  they  were  able  to  support  themselves  and  change  the  trajectory  of  their  lives <period> in  october  of  05 <comma> after  those  first  seven  loans  were  paid <comma> matt  and  i  took  the  word  beta  off  of  the  site <period> we  said <comma> our  little  experiment  has  been  a  success <period> let  's  start  for  real  that  was  our  official  launch <period> and  then  that  first  year <comma> october  05  through  06 <comma> kiva  facilitated  $500,000  in  loans <period> the  second  year <comma> it  was  a  total  of  15  million <period> the  third  year <comma> the  total  was  up  to  around  40 <period> the  fourth  year <comma> we  were  just  short  of  100 <period> and  today <comma> less  than  five  years  in <comma> kiva  's  facilitated  more  than  150  million  dollars <comma> in  little  25-dollar  bits <comma> from  lenders  and  entrepreneurs <comma> more  than  a  million  of  those <comma> collectively  in  200  countries <period> so  that  's  where  kiva  is  today <comma> just  to  bring  you  right  up  to  the  present <period> and  while  those  numbers  and  those  statistics  to  me <comma> kiva  's  really  about  stories <period> it  's  about  retelling  the  story  of  the  poor <comma> and  it  's  about  giving  ourselves  an  opportunity  to  engage  that  validates  their  dignity <comma> validates  a  partnership  relationship <comma> not  a  relationship  that  's  based  on  the  traditional  sort  of  donor  beneficiary  weirdness  that  can  happen <period> but  instead  a  relationship  that  can  promote  respect  and  hope  and  this  optimism  that  together  we  can  move  forward <period> so  what  i  hope  is  that <comma> not  only  can  the  money  keep  flowing  forth  through  kiva <comma> that  's  a  very  positive  and  meaningful  thing <comma> but  i  hope  kiva  can  blur  those  lines <comma> like  i  said <comma> between  the  traditional  rich  and  poor  categories  that  we  're  taught  to  see  in  the  world <comma> this  false  dichotomy  of  us  and  them <comma> have  and  have  not <period> i  hope  that  kiva  can  blur  those  lines <period> because  as  that  happens <comma> i  think  we  can  feel  free  to  interact  in  a  way  that  's  more  open <comma> more  just  and  more  creative <comma> to  engage  with  each  other  and  to  help  each  other <period> imagine  how  you  feel  when  you  see  somebody  on  street  who  is  begging  and  you  're  about  to  approach  them <period> imagine  how  you  feel <period> and  then  imagine  the  difference  when  you  might  see  somebody  who  has  a  story  of  entrepreneurship  and  hard  work  who  wants  to  tell  you  about  their  business <period> maybe  they  're  smiling <comma> and  they  want  to  talk  to  you  about  what  they've  done <period> imagine  if  you  're  speaking  with  somebody  who  's  growing  things  and  making  them  flourish <comma> somebody  who  's  using  their  talents  to  do  something  productive <comma> somebody  who  's  built  their  own  business  from  scratch <comma> someone  who  is  surrounded  by  abundance <comma> not  scarcity <comma> who  's  in  fact  creating  abundance <comma> somebody  with  full  hands  with  something  to  offer <comma> not  empty  hands  asking  for  you  to  give  them  something <period> imagine  if  you  could  hear  a  story  you  did  n't  expect  of  somebody  who  wakes  up  every  day  and  works  very <comma> very  hard  to  make  their  life  better <period> these  stories  can  really  change  the  way  that  we  think  about  each  other <period> and  if  we  can  catalyze  a  supportive  community  to  come  around  these  individuals  and  to  participate  in  their  story  by  lending  a  little  bit  of  money <comma> i  think  that  can  change  the  way  we  believe  in  each  other  and  each  other  's  potential <period> now  for  me <comma> kiva  is  just  the  beginning <period> and  as  i  look  forward  to  what  is  next <period> it  's  been  helpful  to  reflect  on  the  things  i've  learned  so  far <period> the  first  one  is <comma> as  i  mentioned <comma> entrepreneurship  was  a  new  idea  to  me <period> kiva  borrowers <comma> as  i  interviewed  them  and  got  to  know  them  over  the  last  few  years <comma> have  taught  me  what  entrepreneurship  is <period> and  i  think <comma> at  its  core <comma> it  's  deciding  that  you  want  your  life  to  be  better <period> you  see  an  opportunity  and  you  decide  what  you  're  going  to  do  to  try  to  seize  that <period> in  short <comma> it  's  deciding  that  tomorrow  can  better  than  today  and  going  after  that <period> second  thing  that  i've  learned  is  that  loans  are  a  very  interesting  tool  for  connectivity <period> so  they  're  not  a  donation <period> yeah <comma> maybe  it  does  n't  sound  that  much  different <period> but  in  fact <comma> when  you  give  something  to  someone  and  they  say <comma> thanks <comma> and  let  you  know  how  things  go <comma> that  's  one  thing <period> when  you  lend  them  money <comma> and  they  slowly  pay  you  back  over  time <comma> you  have  this  excuse  to  have  an  ongoing  dialogue <period> this  continued  attention <comma> this  ongoing  attention <comma> is  a  really  big  deal  to  build  different  kinds  of  relationships  among  us <period> and  then  third <comma> from  what  i've  heard  from  the  entrepreneurs  i've  gotten  to  know <comma> when  all  else  is  equal <comma> given  the  option  to  have  just  money  to  do  what  you  need  to  do <comma> or  money  plus  the  support  and  encouragement  of  a  global  community <comma> people  choose  the  community  plus  the  money <period> that  's  a  much  more  meaningful  combination <comma> a  more  powerful  combination <period> so  with  that  in  mind <comma> this  particular  incident  has  led  to  the  things  that  i  'm  working  on  now <period> i  see  entrepreneurs  everywhere  now <comma> now  that  i  'm  tuned  into  this <period> and  one  thing  that  i've  seen  is  there  are  a  lot  of  supportive  communities  that  already  exist  in  the  world <period> with  social  networks <comma> it  's  an  amazing  way <comma> growing  the  number  of  people  that  we  all  have  around  us  in  our  own  supportive  communities <comma> rapidly <period> i've  been  wondering <comma> how  can  we  engage  these  supportive  communities  to  catalyze  even  more  entrepreneurial  ideas  and  to  catalyze  all  of  us  to  make  tomorrow  better  than  today <questionmark> as  i've  researched  what  's  going  on  in  the  united  states <comma> a  few  interesting  little  insights  have  come  up <period> so  one  is  that <comma> of  course <comma> as  we  all  might  expect <comma> many  small  businesses  in  the  us <period> and  all  over  the  world  still  need  money  to  grow  and  to  do  more  of  what  they  want  to  do  or  they  might  need  money  during  a  hard  month <period> but  there  's  always  a  need  for  resources  close  by <period> another  thing  is <comma> it  turns  out <comma> those  resources  do  n't  usually  come  from  the  places  you  might  expect <comma> banks <comma> venture  capitalists <comma> other  organizations  and  support  structures <comma> they  come  from  friends  and  family <period> some  statistics  say  85  percent  or  more  of  funding  for  small  businesses  comes  from  friends  and  family <period> that  's  around  130  billion  dollars  a  year  -- <period> it  's  a  lot <period> and  third <comma> so  as  people  are  doing  this  friends  and  family  fundraising  process <comma> it  's  very  awkward <comma> people  do  n't  know  exactly  what  to  ask  for <comma> how  to  ask <comma> what  to  promise  in  return <comma> even  though  they  have  the  best  of  intentions  and  want  to  thank  those  people  that  are  supporting  them <period> so  to  harness  the  power  of  these  supportive  communities  in  a  new  way  and  to  allow  entrepreneurs  to  decide  for  themselves  exactly  what  that  financial  exchange  should  look  like <comma> exactly  what  fits  them  and  the  people  around  them <comma> this  week  actually <comma> we  're  quietly  doing  a  launch  of  profounder <comma> which  is  a  crowd  funding  platform  for  small  businesses  to  raise  what  they  need  through  investments  from  their  friends  and  family <period> and  it  's  investments <comma> not  donations <comma> not  loans <comma> but  investments  that  have  a  dynamic  return <period> so  the  mapping  of  participating  in  the  story <comma> it  actually  flows  with  the  up  and  down <period> so  in  short <comma> it  's  a  do-it-yourself  tool  for  small  businesses  to  raise  these  funds <period> and  what  you  can  do  is  go  onto  the  site <comma> create  a  profile <comma> create  investment  terms  in  a  really  easy  way <period> we  make  it  really <comma> really  simple  for  me  as  well  as  anyone  else  who  wants  to  use  the  site <period> and  we  allow  entrepreneurs  to  share  a  percentage  of  their  revenues <period> they  can  raise  up  to  a  million  dollars  from  an  unlimited  number  of  unaccredited <comma> unsophisticated  investors <comma> everyday  people <comma> heaven  forbid <comma> and  they  can  share  those  returns  over  time <comma> again <comma> whatever  terms  they  set <period> as  investors  choose  to  become  involved  based  on  those  terms <comma> they  can  either  take  their  rewards  back  as  cash <comma> or  they  can  decide  in  advance  to  give  those  returns  away  to  a  non-profit <period> so  they  can  be  a  cash <comma> or  a  cause <comma> investor <period> it  's  my  hope  that  this  kind  of  tool  can  show  anybody  who  has  an  idea  a  path  to  go  do  what  they  want  to  do  in  the  world  and  to  gather  the  people  around  them  that  they  already  have <comma> the  people  that  know  them  best  and  that  love  them  and  want  to  support  them <comma> to  gather  them  to  make  this  happen <period> so  that  's  what  i  'm  working  on  now <period> and  to  close <comma> i  just  want  to  say <comma> look  these  are  tools <period> right  now <comma> profounder  's  right  at  the  very  beginning <comma> and  it  's  very  palpable <period> it  's  very  clear  to  me <comma> that  it  's  just  a  vessel <comma> it  's  just  a  tool <period> what  we  need  are  for  people  to  care <comma> to  actually  go  use  it <comma> just  like  they've  cared  enough  to  use  kiva  to  make  those  connections <period> but  the  good  news  is  i  do  n't  think  i  need  to  stand  here  and  convince  you  to  care  -- <period> i  'm  not  even  going  to  try <period> i  do  n't  think <comma> even  though  we  often  hear <comma> you  know <comma> hear  the  ethical  and  moral  reasons <comma> the  religious  reasons <comma> here  's  why  caring  and  giving  will  make  you  happier  i  do  n't  think  we  need  to  be  convinced  of  that <period> i  think  we  know <period> in  fact <comma> i  think  we  know  so  much <comma> and  it  's  such  a  reality  that  we  care  so  deeply <comma> that  in  fact <comma> what  usually  stops  us  is  that  we  're  afraid  to  try  and  to  mess  up <comma> because  we  care  so  very  much  about  helping  each  other  and  being  meaningful  in  each  other  's  lives <period> so  what  i  think  i  can  do  today <comma> that  best  thing  i  can  give  you <comma> and  i  think  i  can  remind  us  that  we  do  care <period> i  think  we  all  already  know  that <period> and  i  think  we  know  that  love  is  resilient  enough  just  a  sec <period> thanks <period> thanks <period> for  me <comma> the  best  way  to  be  inspired  to  try  is  to  stop  and  to  listen  to  someone  else  's  story <period> and  i  'm  grateful  that  i've  gotten  to  do  that  here  at  ted <period> and  i  'm  grateful  that  whenever  i  do  that <comma> guaranteed <comma> i  am  inspired <comma> i  am  inspired  by  the  person  i  am  listening  to <period> and  i  believe  more  and  more  every  time  i  listen  in  that  that  person  's  potential  to  do  great  things  in  the  world  and  in  my  own  potential  to  maybe  help <period> and  that <comma> forget  the  tools <comma> forget  the  moving  around  of  resources <comma> that  stuff  's  easy <period> believing  in  each  other <comma> really  being  sure  when  push  comes  to  shove  that  each  one  of  us  can  do  amazing  things  in  the  world <comma> that  is  what  can  make  our  stories  into  love  stories  and  our  collective  story  into  one  that  continually  perpetuates  hope  and  good  things  for  all  of  us <period> so  that <comma> this  belief  in  each  other <comma> knowing  that  without  a  doubt  and  practicing  that  every  day  in  whatever  you  do <comma> that  's  what  i  believe  will  change  the  world  and  make  tomorrow  better  than  today <period> thank  you <period> it  's  the  second  world  war <period> a  german  prison  camp <period> and  this  man <comma> archie  cochrane <comma> is  a  prisoner  of  war  and  a  doctor <comma> and  he  has  a  problem <period> the  problem  is  that  the  men  under  his  care  are  suffering  from  an  excruciating  and  debilitating  condition  that  archie  does  n't  really  understand <period> the  symptoms  are  this  horrible  swelling  up  of  fluids  under  the  skin <period> but  he  does  n't  know  whether  it  's  an  infection <comma> whether  it  's  to  do  with  malnutrition <period> he  does  n't  know  how  to  cure  it <period> and  he  's  operating  in  a  hostile  environment <period> and  people  do  terrible  things  in  wars <period> the  german  camp  guards <comma> they've  got  bored <period> they've  taken  to  just  firing  into  the  prison  camp  at  random  for  fun <period> on  one  particular  occasion <comma> one  of  the  guards  threw  a  grenade  into  the  prisoners  lavatory  while  it  was  full  of  prisoners <period> he  said  he  heard  suspicious  laughter <period> and  archie  cochrane <comma> as  the  camp  doctor <comma> was  one  of  the  first  men  in  to  clear  up  the  mess <period> and  one  more  thing <comma> archie  was  suffering  from  this  illness  himself <period> so  the  situation  seemed  pretty  desperate <period> but  archie  cochrane  was  a  resourceful  person <period> he'd  already  smuggled  vitamin  c  into  the  camp <comma> and  now  he  managed  to  get  hold  of  supplies  of  marmite  on  the  black  market <period> now  some  of  you  will  be  wondering  what  marmite  is <period> marmite  is  a  breakfast  spread  beloved  of  the  british <period> it  looks  like  crude  oil <period> it  tastes <period> zesty <period> and  importantly <comma> it  's  a  rich  source  of  vitamin  b12 <period> so  archie  splits  the  men  under  his  care  as  best  he  can  into  two  equal  groups <period> he  gives  half  of  them  vitamin  c <period> he  gives  half  of  them  vitamin  b12 <period> he  very  carefully  and  meticulously  notes  his  results  in  an  exercise  book <period> and  after  just  a  few  days <comma> it  becomes  clear  that  whatever  is  causing  this  illness <comma> marmite  is  the  cure <period> so  cochrane  then  goes  to  the  germans  who  are  running  the  prison  camp <period> now  you've  got  to  imagine  at  the  moment <comma> forget  this  photo <comma> imagine  this  guy  with  this  long  ginger  beard  and  this  shock  of  red  hair <period> he  has  n't  been  able  to  shave <comma> a  sort  of  billy  connolly  figure <period> cochrane <comma> he  starts  ranting  at  these  germans  in  this  scottish  accent <comma> in  fluent  german <comma> by  the  way <comma> but  in  a  scottish  accent <comma> and  explains  to  them  how  german  culture  was  the  culture  that  gave  schiller  and  goethe  to  the  world <period> and  he  cannot  understand  how  this  barbarism  can  be  tolerated <period> and  he  vents  his  frustrations <period> and  then  he  goes  back  to  his  quarters <comma> breaks  down  and  weeps  because  he  's  convinced  that  the  situation  is  hopeless <period> but  a  young  german  doctor  picks  up  archie  cochrane  's  exercise  book  and  says  to  his  colleagues <comma> this  evidence  is  incontrovertible <period> if  we  do  n't  supply  vitamins  to  the  prisoners <comma> it  's  a  war  crime  and  the  next  morning <comma> supplies  of  vitamin  b12  are  delivered  to  the  camp <comma> and  the  prisoners  begin  to  recover <period> now  i  'm  not  telling  you  this  story  because  i  think  archie  cochrane  is  a  dude <comma> although  archie  cochrane  is  a  dude <period> i  'm  not  even  telling  you  the  story  because  i  think  we  should  be  running  more  carefully  controlled  randomized  trials  in  all  aspects  of  public  policy <comma> although  i  think  that  would  also  be  completely  awesome <period> i  'm  telling  you  this  story  because  archie  cochrane <comma> all  his  life <comma> fought  against  a  terrible  affliction <period> and  he  realized  it  was  debilitating  to  individuals  and  it  was  corrosive  to  societies <period> and  he  had  a  name  for  it <period> he  called  it  the  god  complex <period> now  i  can  describe  the  symptoms  of  the  god  complex  very <comma> very  easily <period> so  the  symptoms  of  the  complex  are <comma> no  matter  how  complicated  the  problem <comma> you  have  an  absolutely  overwhelming  belief  that  you  are  infallibly  right  in  your  solution <period> now  archie  was  a  doctor <period> so  he  hung  around  with  doctors  a  lot <period> and  doctors  suffer  from  the  god  complex  a  lot <period> now  i  'm  an  economist <comma> i  'm  not  a  doctor <comma> but  i  see  the  god  complex  around  me  all  the  time  in  my  fellow  economists <period> i  see  it  in  our  business  leaders <period> i  see  it  in  the  politicians  we  vote  for <comma> people  who <comma> in  the  face  of  an  incredibly  complicated  world <comma> are  nevertheless  absolutely  convinced  that  they  understand  the  way  that  the  world  works <period> and  you  know <comma> with  the  future  billions  that  we've  been  hearing  about <comma> the  world  is  simply  far  too  complex  to  understand  in  that  way <period> well  let  me  give  you  an  example <period> imagine  for  a  moment  that <comma> instead  of  tim  harford  in  front  of  you <comma> there  was  hans  rosling  presenting  his  graphs <period> you  know  hans <comma> the  mick  jagger  of  ted <period> and  he'd  be  showing  you  these  amazing  statistics <comma> these  amazing  animations <period> and  they  are  brilliant <period> it  's  wonderful  work <period> but  a  typical  hans  rosling  graph <comma> think  for  a  moment <comma> not  what  it  shows <comma> but  think  instead  about  what  it  leaves  out <period> so  it  'll  show  you  gdp  per  capita <comma> population <comma> longevity <comma> that  's  about  it <period> so  three  pieces  of  data  for  each  country  -- <period> three  pieces  of  data <period> three  pieces  of  data  is  nothing <period> i  mean <comma> have  a  look  at  this  graph <period> this  is  produced  by  the  physicist  cesar  hidalgo <period> he  's  at  mit <period> now  you  wo  n't  be  able  to  understand  a  word  of  it <comma> but  this  is  what  it  looks  like <period> cesar  has  trolled  the  database  of  over  5,000  different  products <comma> and  he  's  used  techniques  of  network  analysis  to  interrogate  this  database  and  to  graph  relationships  between  the  different  products <period> and  it  's  wonderful <comma> wonderful  work <period> you  show  all  these  interconnections <comma> all  these  interrelations <period> and  i  think  it  'll  be  profoundly  useful  in  understanding  how  it  is  that  economies  grow <period> brilliant  work <period> cesar  and  i  tried  to  write  a  piece  for  the  new  york  times  magazine  explaining  how  this  works <period> and  what  we  learned  is  cesar  's  work  is  far  too  good  to  explain  in  the  new  york  times  magazine <period> five  thousand  products <comma> that  's  still  nothing <period> five  thousand  products <comma> imagine  counting  every  product  category  in  cesar  hidalgo  's  data <period> imagine  you  had  one  second  per  product  category <period> in  about  the  length  of  this  session <comma> you  would  have  counted  all  5,000 <period> now  imagine  doing  the  same  thing  for  every  different  type  of  product  on  sale  in  walmart <period> there  are  100,000  there <period> it  would  take  you  all  day <period> now  imagine  trying  to  count  every  different  specific  product  and  service  on  sale  in  a  major  economy  such  as  tokyo <comma> london  or  new  york <period> it  's  even  more  difficult  in  edinburgh  because  you  have  to  count  all  the  whisky  and  the  tartan <period> if  you  wanted  to  count  every  product  and  service  on  offer  in  new  york <comma> there  are  10  billion  of  them <comma> it  would  take  you  317  years <period> this  is  how  complex  the  economy  we've  created  is <period> and  i  'm  just  counting  toasters  here <period> i  'm  not  trying  to  solve  the  middle  east  problem <period> the  complexity  here  is  unbelievable <period> and  just  a  piece  of  context <comma> the  societies  in  which  our  brains  evolved  had  about  300  products  and  services <period> you  could  count  them  in  five  minutes <period> so  this  is  the  complexity  of  the  world  that  surrounds  us <period> this  perhaps  is  why  we  find  the  god  complex  so  tempting <period> we  tend  to  retreat  and  say <comma> we  can  draw  a  picture <comma> we  can  post  some  graphs <comma> we  get  it <comma> we  understand  how  this  works  and  we  do  n't <period> we  never  do <period> now  i  'm  not  trying  to  deliver  a  nihilistic  message  here <period> i  'm  not  trying  to  say  we  cannot  solve  complicated  problems  in  a  complicated  world <period> we  clearly  can <period> but  the  way  we  solve  them  is  with  humility <comma> to  abandon  the  god  complex  and  to  actually  use  a  problem-solving  technique  that  works <period> and  we  have  a  problem-solving  technique  that  works <period> now  you  show  me  a  successful  complex  system <comma> and  i  will  show  you  a  system  that  has  evolved  through  trial  and  error <period> here  's  an  example <period> this  baby  was  produced  through  trial  and  error <period> i  realize  that  's  an  ambiguous  statement <period> maybe  i  should  clarify  it <period> this  baby  is  a  human  body <comma> it  evolved <period> what  is  evolution <questionmark> over  millions  of  years <comma> variation  and  selection <comma> variation  and  selection <comma> trial  and  error <comma> trial  and  error <period> and  it  's  not  just  biological  systems  that  produce  miracles  through  trial  and  error <period> you  could  use  it  in  an  industrial  context <period> so  let  's  say  you  wanted  to  make  detergent <period> let  's  say  you  're  unilever  and  you  want  to  make  detergent  in  a  factory  near  liverpool <period> how  do  you  do  it <questionmark> well  you  have  this  great  big  tank  full  of  liquid  detergent <period> you  pump  it  at  a  high  pressure  through  a  nozzle <period> you  create  a  spray  of  detergent <period> then  the  spray  dries <period> it  turns  into  powder <period> it  falls  to  the  floor <period> you  scoop  it  up <period> you  put  it  in  cardboard  boxes <period> you  sell  it  at  a  supermarket <period> you  make  lots  of  money <period> how  do  you  design  that  nozzle <questionmark> it  turns  out  to  be  very  important <period> now  if  you  ascribe  to  the  god  complex <comma> what  you  do  is  you  find  yourself  a  little  god <period> you  find  yourself  a  mathematician <period> you  find  yourself  a  physicist <comma> somebody  who  understands  the  dynamics  of  this  fluid <period> and  he  will <comma> or  she  will <comma> calculate  the  optimal  design  of  the  nozzle <period> now  unilever  did  this  and  it  did  n't  work  -- <period> too  complicated <period> even  this  problem <comma> too  complicated <period> but  the  geneticist  professor  steve  jones  describes  how  unilever  actually  did  solve  this  problem  -- <period> trial  and  error <comma> variation  and  selection <period> you  take  a  nozzle  and  you  create  10  random  variations  on  the  nozzle <period> you  try  out  all  10 <period> you  keep  the  one  that  works  best <period> you  create  10  variations  on  that  one <period> you  try  out  all  10 <period> you  keep  the  one  that  works  best <period> you  try  out  10  variations  on  that  one <period> you  see  how  this  works <comma> right <questionmark> and  after  45  generations <comma> you  have  this  incredible  nozzle <period> it  looks  a  bit  like  a  chess  piece  -- <period> functions  absolutely  brilliantly <period> we  have  no  idea  why  it  works <comma> no  idea  at  all <period> and  the  moment  you  step  back  from  the  god  complex <comma> let  's  just  try  to  have  a  bunch  of  stuff <period> let  's  have  a  systematic  way  of  determining  what  's  working  and  what  's  not  -- <period> you  can  solve  your  problem <period> now  this  process  of  trial  and  error  is  actually  far  more  common  in  successful  institutions  than  we  care  to  recognize <period> and  we've  heard  a  lot  about  how  economies  function <period> the  us <period> economy  is  still  the  world  's  greatest  economy <period> how  did  it  become  the  world  's  greatest  economy <questionmark> i  could  give  you  all  kinds  of  facts  and  figures  about  the  us <period> economy <comma> but  i  think  the  most  salient  one  is  this <comma> ten  percent  of  american  businesses  disappear  every  year <period> that  is  a  huge  failure  rate <period> it  's  far  higher  than  the  failure  rate  of <comma> say <comma> americans <period> ten  percent  of  americans  do  n't  disappear  every  year <period> which  leads  us  to  conclude  american  businesses  fail  faster  than  americans <comma> and  therefore  american  businesses  are  evolving  faster  than  americans <period> and  eventually <comma> they  'll  have  evolved  to  such  a  high  peak  of  perfection  that  they  will  make  us  all  their  pets  -- <period> if <comma> of  course <comma> they  have  n't  already  done  so <period> i  sometimes  wonder <period> but  it  's  this  process  of  trial  and  error  that  explains  this  great  divergence <comma> this  incredible  performance  of  western  economies <period> it  did  n't  come  because  you  put  some  incredibly  smart  person  in  charge <period> it  's  come  through  trial  and  error <period> now  i've  been  sort  of  banging  on  about  this  for  the  last  couple  of  months <comma> and  people  sometimes  say  to  me <comma> well  tim <comma> it  's  kind  of  obvious <period> obviously  trial  and  error  is  very  important <period> obviously  experimentation  is  very  important <period> now  why  are  you  just  wandering  around  saying  this  obvious  thing  so  i  say <comma> okay <comma> fine <period> you  think  it  's  obvious <questionmark> i  will  admit  it  's  obvious  when  schools  start  teaching  children  that  there  are  some  problems  that  do  n't  have  a  correct  answer <period> stop  giving  them  lists  of  questions  every  single  one  of  which  has  an  answer <period> and  there  's  an  authority  figure  in  the  corner  behind  the  teacher  's  desk  who  knows  all  the  answers <period> and  if  you  cannot  find  the  answers <comma> you  must  be  lazy  or  stupid <period> when  schools  stop  doing  that  all  the  time <comma> i  will  admit  that <comma> yes <comma> it  's  obvious  that  trial  and  error  is  a  good  thing <period> when  a  politician  stands  up  campaigning  for  elected  office  and  says <comma> i  want  to  fix  our  health  system <period> i  want  to  fix  our  education  system <period> i  have  no  idea  how  to  do  it <period> i  have  half  a  dozen  ideas <period> we  're  going  to  test  them  out <period> they  'll  probably  all  fail <period> then  we  'll  test  some  other  ideas  out <period> we  'll  find  some  that  work <period> we  'll  build  on  those <period> we  'll  get  rid  of  the  ones  that  do  n't <comma> when  a  politician  campaigns  on  that  platform <comma> and  more  importantly <comma> when  voters  like  you  and  me  are  willing  to  vote  for  that  kind  of  politician <comma> then  i  will  admit  that  it  is  obvious  that  trial  and  error  works <comma> and  that <comma> thank  you <period> until  then <comma> until  then  i  'm  going  to  keep  banging  on  about  trial  and  error  and  why  we  should  abandon  the  god  complex <period> because  it  's  so  hard  to  admit  our  own  fallibility <period> it  's  so  uncomfortable <period> and  archie  cochrane  understood  this  as  well  as  anybody <period> there  's  this  one  trial  he  ran  many  years  after  world  war  ii <period> he  wanted  to  test  out  the  question  of <comma> where  is  it  that  patients  should  recover  from  heart  attacks <questionmark> should  they  recover  in  a  specialized  cardiac  unit  in  hospital <comma> or  should  they  recover  at  home <questionmark> all  the  cardiac  doctors  tried  to  shut  him  down <period> they  had  the  god  complex  in  spades <period> they  knew  that  their  hospitals  were  the  right  place  for  patients <period> and  they  knew  it  was  very  unethical  to  run  any  kind  of  trial  or  experiment <period> nevertheless <comma> archie  managed  to  get  permission  to  do  this <period> he  ran  his  trial <period> and  after  the  trial  had  been  running  for  a  little  while <comma> he  gathered  together  all  his  colleagues  around  his  table <comma> and  he  said <comma> well <comma> gentlemen <comma> we  have  some  preliminary  results <period> they  're  not  statistically  significant <period> but  we  have  something <period> and  it  turns  out  that  you  're  right  and  i  'm  wrong <period> it  is  dangerous  for  patients  to  recover  from  heart  attacks  at  home <period> they  should  be  in  hospital  and  there  's  this  uproar <comma> and  all  the  doctors  start  pounding  the  table  and  saying <comma> we  always  said  you  were  unethical <comma> archie <period> you  're  killing  people  with  your  clinical  trials <period> you  need  to  shut  it  down  now <period> shut  it  down  at  once  and  there  's  this  huge  hubbub <period> archie  lets  it  die  down <period> and  then  he  says <comma> well  that  's  very  interesting <comma> gentlemen <comma> because  when  i  gave  you  the  table  of  results <comma> i  swapped  the  two  columns  around <period> it  turns  out  your  hospitals  are  killing  people <comma> and  they  should  be  at  home <period> would  you  like  to  close  down  the  trial  now <comma> or  should  we  wait  until  we  have  robust  results  tumbleweed  rolls  through  the  meeting  room <period> but  cochrane  would  do  that  kind  of  thing <period> and  the  reason  he  would  do  that  kind  of  thing  is  because  he  understood  it  feels  so  much  better  to  stand  there  and  say <comma> here  in  my  own  little  world <comma> i  am  a  god <comma> i  understand  everything <period> i  do  not  want  to  have  my  opinions  challenged <period> i  do  not  want  to  have  my  conclusions  tested  it  feels  so  much  more  comfortable  simply  to  lay  down  the  law <period> cochrane  understood  that  uncertainty <comma> that  fallibility <comma> that  being  challenged <comma> they  hurt <period> and  you  sometimes  need  to  be  shocked  out  of  that <period> now  i  'm  not  going  to  pretend  that  this  is  easy <period> it  is  n't  easy <period> it  's  incredibly  painful <period> and  since  i  started  talking  about  this  subject  and  researching  this  subject <comma> i've  been  really  haunted  by  something  a  japanese  mathematician  said  on  the  subject <period> so  shortly  after  the  war <comma> this  young  man <comma> yutaka  taniyama <comma> developed  this  amazing  conjecture  called  the  taniyama-shimura  conjecture <period> it  turned  out  to  be  absolutely  instrumental  many  decades  later  in  proving  fermat  's  last  theorem <period> in  fact <comma> it  turns  out  it  's  equivalent  to  proving  fermat  's  last  theorem <period> you  prove  one <comma> you  prove  the  other <period> but  it  was  always  a  conjecture <period> taniyama  tried  and  tried  and  tried  and  he  could  never  prove  that  it  was  true <period> and  shortly  before  his  30th  birthday  in  1958 <comma> yutaka  taniyama  killed  himself <period> his  friend <comma> goro  shimura <comma> who  worked  on  the  mathematics  with  him <comma> many  decades  later <comma> reflected  on  taniyama  's  life <period> he  said <comma> he  was  not  a  very  careful  person  as  a  mathematician <period> he  made  a  lot  of  mistakes <period> but  he  made  mistakes  in  a  good  direction <period> i  tried  to  emulate  him <comma> but  i  realized  it  is  very  difficult  to  make  good  mistakes  thank  you <period> so <comma> i'd  like  to  spend  a  few  minutes  with  you  folks  today  imagining  what  our  planet  might  look  like  in  a  thousand  years <period> but  before  i  do  that <comma> i  need  to  talk  to  you  about  synthetic  materials  like  plastics <comma> which  require  huge  amounts  of  energy  to  create  and <comma> because  of  their  disposal  issues <comma> are  slowly  poisoning  our  planet <period> i  also  want  to  tell  you  and  share  with  you  how  my  team  and  i  have  been  using  mushrooms  over  the  last  three  years <period> not  like  that <period> we  're  using  mushrooms  to  create  an  entirely  new  class  of  materials <comma> which  perform  a  lot  like  plastics  during  their  use <comma> but  are  made  from  crop  waste  and  are  totally  compostable  at  the  end  of  their  lives <period> but  first <comma> i  need  to  talk  to  you  about  what  i  consider  one  of  the  most  egregious  offenders  in  the  disposable  plastics  category <period> this  is  a  material  you  all  know  is  styrofoam <comma> but  i  like  to  think  of  it  as  toxic  white  stuff <period> in  a  single  cubic  foot  of  this  material <comma> about  what  would  come  around  your  computer  or  large  television <comma> you  have  the  same  energy  content  of  about  a  liter  and  a  half  of  petrol <period> yet <comma> after  just  a  few  weeks  of  use <comma> you  'll  throw  this  material  in  the  trash <period> and  this  is  n't  just  found  in  packaging <period> 20  billion  dollars  of  this  material  is  produced  every  year <comma> in  everything  from  building  materials  to  surfboards  to  coffee  cups  to  table  tops <period> and  that  's  not  the  only  place  it  's  found <period> the  epa  estimates <comma> in  the  united  states <comma> by  volume <comma> this  material  occupies  25  percent  of  our  landfills <period> even  worse  is  when  it  finds  its  way  into  our  natural  environment <comma> on  the  side  of  the  road  or  next  to  a  river <period> if  it  's  not  picked  up  by  a  human <comma> like  me  and  you <comma> it  'll  stay  there  for  thousands  and  thousands  of  years <period> perhaps  even  worse  is  when  it  finds  its  way  into  our  oceans <comma> like  in  the  great  plastic  gyre <comma> where  these  materials  are  being  mechanically  broken  into  smaller  and  smaller  bits <comma> but  they  're  not  really  going  away <period> they  're  not  biologically  compatible <period> they  're  basically  fouling  up  earth  's  respiratory  and  circulatory  systems <period> and  because  these  materials  are  so  prolific <comma> because  they  're  found  in  so  many  places <comma> there  's  one  other  place  you  'll  find  this  material <comma> styrene <comma> which  is  made  from  benzene <comma> a  known  carcinogen <period> you  'll  find  it  inside  of  you <period> so <comma> for  all  these  reasons <comma> i  think  we  need  better  materials <comma> and  there  are  three  key  principles  we  can  use  to  guide  these  materials <period> the  first  is  feedstocks <period> today <comma> we  use  a  single  feedstock <comma> petroleum <comma> to  heat  our  homes <comma> power  our  cars  and  make  most  of  the  materials  you  see  around  you <period> we  recognize  this  is  a  finite  resource <comma> and  it  's  simply  crazy  to  do  this <comma> to  put  a  liter  and  a  half  of  petrol  in  the  trash  every  time  you  get  a  package <period> second  of  all <comma> we  should  really  strive  to  use  far  less  energy  in  creating  these  materials <period> i  say  far  less <comma> because  10  percent  is  n't  going  to  cut  it <period> we  should  be  talking  about  half <comma> a  quarter <comma> one-tenth  the  energy  content <period> and  lastly <comma> and  i  think  perhaps  most  importantly <comma> we  should  be  creating  materials  that  fit  into  what  i  call  nature  's  recycling  system <period> this  recycling  system  has  been  in  place  for  the  last  billion  years <period> i  fit  into  it <comma> you  fit  into  it <comma> and  a  hundred  years  tops <comma> my  body  can  return  to  the  earth  with  no  preprocessing <period> yet  that  packaging  i  got  in  the  mail  yesterday  is  going  to  last  for  thousands  of  years <period> this  is  crazy <period> but  nature  provides  us  with  a  really  good  model  here <period> when  a  tree  's  done  using  its  leaves <comma> its  solar  collectors <comma> these  amazing  molecular  photon  capturing  devices <comma> at  the  end  of  a  season <comma> it  does  n't  pack  them  up <comma> take  them  to  the  leaf  reprocessing  center  and  have  them  melted  down  to  form  new  leaves <period> it  just  drops  them <comma> the  shortest  distance  possible <comma> to  the  forest  floor <comma> where  they  're  actually  upcycled  into  next  year  's  topsoil <period> and  this  gets  us  back  to  the  mushrooms <period> because  in  nature <comma> mushrooms  are  the  recycling  system <period> and  what  we've  discovered  is <comma> by  using  a  part  of  the  mushroom  you've  probably  never  seen <comma> analogous  to  its  root  structure <period> it  's  called  mycelium <comma> we  can  actually  grow  materials  with  many  of  the  same  properties  of  conventional  synthetics <period> now <comma> mycelium  is  an  amazing  material <comma> because  it  's  a  self-assembling  material <period> it  actually  takes  things  we  would  consider  waste <comma> things  like  seed  husks  or  woody  biomass <comma> and  can  transform  them  into  a  chitinous  polymer <comma> which  you  can  form  into  almost  any  shape <period> in  our  process <comma> we  basically  use  it  as  a  glue <period> and  by  using  mycelium  as  a  glue <comma> you  can  mold  things  just  like  you  do  in  the  plastic  industry <comma> and  you  can  create  materials  with  many  different  properties <comma> materials  that  are  insulating <comma> fire-resistant <comma> moisture-resistant <comma> vapor-resistant <comma> materials  that  can  absorb  impacts <comma> that  can  absorb  acoustical  impacts <period> but  these  materials  are  grown  from  agricultural  byproducts <comma> not  petroleum <period> and  because  they  're  made  of  natural  materials <comma> they  are  100  percent  compostable  in  you  own  backyard <period> so  i'd  like  to  share  with  you  the  four  basic  steps  required  to  make  these  materials <period> the  first  is  selecting  a  feedstock <comma> preferably  something  that  's  regional <comma> that  's  in  your  area <comma> right <comma> local  manufacturing <period> the  next  is  actually  taking  this  feedstock  and  putting  in  a  tool <comma> physically  filling  an  enclosure <comma> a  mold <comma> in  whatever  shape  you  want  to  get <period> then  you  actually  grow  the  mycelium  through  these  particles <comma> and  that  's  where  the  magic  happens <comma> because  the  organism  is  doing  the  work  in  this  process <comma> not  the  equipment <period> the  final  step  is <comma> of  course <comma> the  product <comma> whether  it  's  a  packaging  material <comma> a  table  top <comma> or  building  block <period> our  vision  is  local  manufacturing <comma> like  the  local  food  movement <comma> for  production <period> so  we've  created  formulations  for  all  around  the  world  using  regional  byproducts <period> if  you  're  in  china <comma> you  might  use  a  rice  husk  or  a  cottonseed  hull <period> if  you  're  in  northern  europe  or  north  america <comma> you  can  use  things  like  buckwheat  husks  or  oat  hulls <period> we  then  process  these  husks  with  some  basic  equipment <period> and  i  want  to  share  with  you  a  quick  video  from  our  facility  that  gives  you  a  sense  of  how  this  looks  at  scale <period> so  what  you  're  seeing  here  is  actually  cotton  hulls  from  texas <comma> in  this  case <period> it  's  a  waste  product <period> and  what  they  're  doing  in  our  equipment  is  going  through  a  continuous  system <comma> which  cleans <comma> cooks <comma> cools  and  pasteurizes  these  materials <comma> while  also  continuously  inoculating  them  with  our  mycelium <period> this  gives  us  a  continuous  stream  of  material  that  we  can  put  into  almost  any  shape <comma> though  today  we  're  making  corner  blocks <period> and  it  's  when  this  lid  goes  on  the  part <comma> that  the  magic  really  starts <period> because  the  manufacturing  process  is  our  organism <period> it  'll  actually  begin  to  digest  these  wastes  and <comma> over  the  next  five  days <comma> assemble  them  into  biocomposites <period> our  entire  facility  is  comprised  of  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  of  these  tools  sitting  indoors  in  the  dark <comma> quietly  self-assembling  materials <comma> and  everything  from  building  materials  to <comma> in  this  case <comma> a  packaging  corner  block <period> so  i've  said  a  number  of  times  that  we  grow  materials <period> and  it  's  kind  of  hard  to  picture  how  that  happens <period> so  my  team  has  taken  five  days-worth  of  growth <comma> a  typical  growth  cycle  for  us <comma> and  condensed  it  into  a  15-second  time  lapse <period> and  i  want  you  to  really  watch  closely  these  little  white  dots  on  the  screen <comma> because <comma> over  the  five-day  period <comma> what  they  do  is  extend  out  and  through  this  material <comma> using  the  energy  that  's  contained  in  these  seed  husks  to  build  this  chitinous  polymer  matrix <period> this  matrix  self-assembles <comma> growing  through  and  around  the  particles <comma> making  millions  and  millions  of  tiny  fibers <period> and  what  parts  of  the  seed  husk  we  do  n't  digest <comma> actually  become  part  of  the  final <comma> physical  composite <period> so  in  front  of  your  eyes <comma> this  part  just  self-assembled <period> it  actually  takes  a  little  longer <period> it  takes  five  days <period> but  it  's  much  faster  than  conventional  farming <period> the  last  step <comma> of  course <comma> is  application <period> in  this  case <comma> we've  grown  a  corner  block <period> a  major  fortune  500  furniture  maker  uses  these  corner  blocks  to  protect  their  tables  in  shipment <period> they  used  to  use  a  plastic  packaging  buffer <comma> but  we  were  able  to  give  them  the  exact  same  physical  performance  with  our  grown  material <period> best  of  all <comma> when  it  gets  to  the  customer <comma> it  's  not  trash <period> they  can  actually  put  this  in  their  natural  ecosystem  without  any  processing <comma> and  it  's  going  to  improve  the  local  soil <period> so <comma> why  mycelium <questionmark> the  first  reason  is  local  open  feedstocks <period> you  want  to  be  able  to  do  this  anywhere  in  the  world  and  not  worry  about  peak  rice  hull  or  peak  cottonseed  hulls <comma> because  you  have  multiple  choices <period> the  next  is  self-assembly <comma> because  the  organism  is  actually  doing  most  of  the  work  in  this  process <period> you  do  n't  need  a  lot  of  equipment  to  set  up  a  production  facility <period> so  you  can  have  lots  of  small  facilities  spread  all  across  the  world <period> biological  yield  is  really  important <period> and  because  100  percent  of  what  we  put  in  the  tool  become  the  final  product <comma> even  the  parts  that  are  n't  digested  become  part  of  the  structure <comma> we  're  getting  incredible  yield  rates <period> natural  polymers <comma> well <period> i  think  that  's  what  's  most  important <comma> because  these  polymers  have  been  tried  and  tested  in  our  ecosystem  for  the  last  billion  years <comma> in  everything  from  mushrooms  to  crustaceans <period> they  're  not  going  to  clog  up  earth  's  ecosystems <period> they  work  great <period> and  while <comma> today <comma> we  can  practically  guarantee  that  yesterday  's  packaging  is  going  to  be  here  in  10,000  years <comma> what  i  want  to  guarantee  is  that  in  10,000  years <comma> our  descendants <comma> our  children  's  children <comma> will  be  living  happily  and  in  harmony  with  a  healthy  earth <period> and  i  think  that  can  be  some  really  good  news <period> thank  you <period> so  since  i  was  here  last  in  06 <comma> we  discovered  that  global  climate  change  is  turning  out  to  be  a  pretty  serious  issue <period> so  we  covered  that  fairly  extensively  in  skeptic  magazine <period> we  investigate  all  kinds  of  scientific  and  quasi-scientific  controversies <period> but  it  turns  out  we  do  n't  have  to  worry  about  any  of  this  because  the  world  's  going  to  end  in  2012 <period> another  update <comma> you  will  recall  i  introduced  you  guys  to  the  quadro  tracker <period> it  's  like  a  water  dowsing  device <period> it  's  just  a  hollow  piece  of  plastic  with  an  antenna  that  swivels  around <period> and  you  walk  around <comma> and  it  points  to  things <period> like  if  you  're  looking  for  marijuana  in  students  lockers <comma> it  'll  point  right  to  somebody <period> oh <comma> sorry <period> this  particular  one  that  was  given  to  me  finds  golf  balls <comma> especially  if  you  're  at  a  golf  course  and  you  check  under  enough  bushes <period> well <comma> under  the  category  of  what  's  the  harm  of  silly  stuff  like  this <questionmark> this  device <comma> the  ade  651 <comma> was  sold  to  the  iraqi  government  for  40,000  dollars  apiece <period> it  's  just  like  this  one <comma> completely  worthless <comma> in  which  it  allegedly  worked  by  electrostatic  magnetic  ion  attraction <comma> which  translates  to  pseudoscientific  baloney <comma> would  be  the  nice  word <comma> in  which  you  string  together  a  bunch  of  words  that  sound  good <comma> but  it  does  absolutely  nothing <period> in  this  case <comma> at  trespass  points <comma> allowing  people  to  go  through  because  your  little  tracker  device  said  they  were  okay <comma> actually  cost  lives <period> so  there  is  a  danger  to  pseudoscience <comma> in  believing  in  this  sort  of  thing <period> so  what  i  want  to  talk  about  today  is  belief <period> i  want  to  believe <comma> and  you  do  too <period> and  in  fact <comma> i  think  my  thesis  here  is  that  belief  is  the  natural  state  of  things <period> it  is  the  default  option <period> we  just  believe <period> we  believe  all  sorts  of  things <period> belief  is  natural <period> disbelief <comma> skepticism <comma> science <comma> is  not  natural <period> it  's  more  difficult <period> it  's  uncomfortable  to  not  believe  things <period> so  like  fox  mulder  on  x-files <comma> who  wants  to  believe  in  ufos <questionmark> well <comma> we  all  do <period> and  the  reason  for  that  is  because  we  have  a  belief  engine  in  our  brains <period> essentially <comma> we  are  pattern-seeking  primates <period> we  connect  the  dots <comma> a  is  connected  to  b <period> b  is  connected  to  c <period> and  sometimes  a  really  is  connected  to  b <period> and  that  's  called  association  learning <period> we  find  patterns <comma> we  make  those  connections <comma> whether  it  's  pavlov  's  dog  here  associating  the  sound  of  the  bell  with  the  food <comma> and  then  he  salivates  to  the  sound  of  the  bell <comma> or  whether  it  's  a  skinnerian  rat <comma> in  which  he  's  having  an  association  between  his  behavior  and  a  reward  for  it <comma> and  therefore  he  repeats  the  behavior <period> in  fact <comma> what  skinner  discovered  is  that <comma> if  you  put  a  pigeon  in  a  box  like  this <comma> and  he  has  to  press  one  of  these  two  keys <comma> and  he  tries  to  figure  out  what  the  pattern  is <comma> and  you  give  him  a  little  reward  in  the  hopper  box  there  -- <period> if  you  just  randomly  assign  rewards  such  that  there  is  no  pattern <comma> they  will  figure  out  any  kind  of  pattern <period> and  whatever  they  were  doing  just  before  they  got  the  reward <comma> they  repeat  that  particular  pattern <period> sometimes  it  was  even  spinning  around  twice  counterclockwise <comma> once  clockwise  and  peck  the  key  twice <period> and  that  's  called  superstition <period> and  that <comma> i  'm  afraid <comma> we  will  always  have  with  us <period> i  call  this  process  patternicity <comma> that  is <comma> the  tendency  to  find  meaningful  patterns  in  both  meaningful  and  meaningless  noise <period> when  we  do  this  process <comma> we  make  two  types  of  errors <period> a  type  i  error <comma> or  false  positive <comma> is  believing  a  pattern  is  real  when  it  's  not <period> our  second  type  of  error  is  a  false  negative <period> a  type  ii  error  is  not  believing  a  pattern  is  real  when  it  is <period> so  let  's  do  a  thought  experiment <period> you  are  a  hominid  three  million  years  ago  walking  on  the  plains  of  africa <period> your  name  is  lucy <comma> okay <questionmark> and  you  hear  a  rustle  in  the  grass <period> is  it  a  dangerous  predator <comma> or  is  it  just  the  wind <questionmark> your  next  decision  could  be  the  most  important  one  of  your  life <period> well <comma> if  you  think  that  the  rustle  in  the  grass  is  a  dangerous  predator  and  it  turns  out  it  's  just  the  wind <comma> you've  made  an  error  in  cognition <comma> made  a  type  i  error <comma> false  positive <period> but  no  harm <period> you  just  move  away <period> you  're  more  cautious <period> you  're  more  vigilant <period> on  the  other  hand <comma> if  you  believe  that  the  rustle  in  the  grass  is  just  the  wind <comma> and  it  turns  out  it  's  a  dangerous  predator <comma> you  're  lunch <period> you've  just  won  a  darwin  award <period> you've  been  taken  out  of  the  gene  pool <period> now  the  problem  here  is  that  patternicities  will  occur  whenever  the  cost  of  making  a  type  i  error  is  less  than  the  cost  of  making  a  type  ii  error <period> this  is  the  only  equation  in  the  talk  by  the  way <period> we  have  a  pattern  detection  problem  that  is  assessing  the  difference  between  a  type  i  and  a  type  ii  error  is  highly  problematic <comma> especially  in  split-second <comma> life-and-death  situations <period> so  the  default  position  is  just <comma> believe  all  patterns  are  real  -- <period> all  rustles  in  the  grass  are  dangerous  predators  and  not  just  the  wind <period> and  so  i  think  that  we  evolved <period> there  was  a  natural  selection  for  the  propensity  for  our  belief  engines <comma> our  pattern-seeking  brain  processes <comma> to  always  find  meaningful  patterns  and  infuse  them  with  these  sort  of  predatory  or  intentional  agencies  that  i  'll  come  back  to <period> so  for  example <comma> what  do  you  see  here <questionmark> it  's  a  horse  head <comma> that  's  right <period> it  looks  like  a  horse <period> it  must  be  a  horse <period> that  's  a  pattern <period> and  is  it  really  a  horse <questionmark> or  is  it  more  like  a  frog <questionmark> see <comma> our  pattern  detection  device <comma> which  appears  to  be  located  in  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex <comma> it  's  our  little  detection  device  there <comma> can  be  easily  fooled <comma> and  this  is  the  problem <period> for  example <comma> what  do  you  see  here <questionmark> yes <comma> of  course <comma> it  's  a  cow <period> once  i  prime  the  brain <comma> it  's  called  cognitive  priming <comma> once  i  prime  the  brain  to  see  it <comma> it  pops  back  out  again  even  without  the  pattern  that  i've  imposed  on  it <period> and  what  do  you  see  here <questionmark> some  people  see  a  dalmatian  dog <period> yes <comma> there  it  is <period> and  there  's  the  prime <period> so  when  i  go  back  without  the  prime <comma> your  brain  already  has  the  model  so  you  can  see  it  again <period> what  do  you  see  here <questionmark> planet  saturn <period> yes <comma> that  's  good <period> how  about  here <questionmark> just  shout  out  anything  you  see <period> that  's  a  good  audience <comma> chris <period> because  there  's  nothing  in  this <period> well <comma> allegedly  there  's  nothing <period> this  is  an  experiment  done  by  jennifer  whitson  at  ut <period> austin  on  corporate  environments  and  whether  feelings  of  uncertainty  and  out  of  control  makes  people  see  illusory  patterns <period> that  is <comma> almost  everybody  sees  the  planet  saturn <period> people  that  are  put  in  a  condition  of  feeling  out  of  control  are  more  likely  to  see  something  in  this <comma> which  is  allegedly  patternless <period> in  other  words <comma> the  propensity  to  find  these  patterns  goes  up  when  there  's  a  lack  of  control <period> for  example <comma> baseball  players  are  notoriously  superstitious  when  they  're  batting <comma> but  not  so  much  when  they  're  fielding <period> because  fielders  are  successful  90  to  95  percent  of  the  time <period> the  best  batters  fail  seven  out  of  10  times <period> so  their  superstitions <comma> their  patternicities <comma> are  all  associated  with  feelings  of  lack  of  control  and  so  forth <period> what  do  you  see  in  this  particular  one  here <comma> in  this  field <questionmark> anybody  see  an  object  there <questionmark> there  actually  is  something  here <comma> but  it  's  degraded <period> while  you  're  thinking  about  that <comma> this  was  an  experiment  done  by  susan  blackmore <comma> a  psychologist  in  england <comma> who  showed  subjects  this  degraded  image  and  then  ran  a  correlation  between  their  scores  on  an  esp  test <comma> how  much  did  they  believe  in  the  paranormal <comma> supernatural <comma> angels  and  so  forth <period> and  those  who  scored  high  on  the  esp  scale <comma> tended  to  not  only  see  more  patterns  in  the  degraded  images  but  incorrect  patterns <period> here  is  what  you  show  subjects <period> the  fish  is  degraded  20  percent <comma> 50  percent  and  then  the  one  i  showed  you <comma> 70  percent <period> a  similar  experiment  was  done  by  another  swiss  psychologist  named  peter  brugger <comma> who  found  significantly  more  meaningful  patterns  were  perceived  on  the  right  hemisphere <comma> via  the  left  visual  field <comma> than  the  left  hemisphere <period> so  if  you  present  subjects  the  images  such  that  it  's  going  to  end  up  on  the  right  hemisphere  instead  of  the  left <comma> then  they  're  more  likely  to  see  patterns  than  if  you  put  it  on  the  left  hemisphere <period> our  right  hemisphere  appears  to  be  where  a  lot  of  this  patternicity  occurs <period> so  what  we  're  trying  to  do  is  bore  into  the  brain  to  see  where  all  this  happens <period> brugger  and  his  colleague <comma> christine  mohr <comma> gave  subjects  l-dopa <period> l-dopa  's  a  drug <comma> as  you  know <comma> given  for  treating  parkinson  's  disease <comma> which  is  related  to  a  decrease  in  dopamine <period> l-dopa  increases  dopamine <period> an  increase  of  dopamine  caused  subjects  to  see  more  patterns  than  those  that  did  not  receive  the  dopamine <period> so  dopamine  appears  to  be  the  drug  associated  with  patternicity <period> in  fact <comma> neuroleptic  drugs  that  are  used  to  eliminate  psychotic  behavior <comma> things  like  paranoia <comma> delusions  and  hallucinations <comma> these  are  patternicities <period> they  're  incorrect  patterns <period> they  're  false  positives <period> they  're  type  i  errors <period> and  if  you  give  them  drugs  that  are  dopamine  antagonists <comma> they  go  away <period> that  is <comma> you  decrease  the  amount  of  dopamine <comma> and  their  tendency  to  see  patterns  like  that  decreases <period> on  the  other  hand <comma> amphetamines  like  cocaine  are  dopamine  agonists <period> they  increase  the  amount  of  dopamine <period> so  you  're  more  likely  to  feel  in  a  euphoric  state <comma> creativity <comma> find  more  patterns <period> in  fact <comma> i  saw  robin  williams  recently  talk  about  how  he  thought  he  was  much  funnier  when  he  was  doing  cocaine <comma> when  he  had  that  issue <comma> than  now <period> so  perhaps  more  dopamine  is  related  to  more  creativity <period> dopamine <comma> i  think <comma> changes  our  signal-to-noise  ratio <period> that  is <comma> how  accurate  we  are  in  finding  patterns <period> if  it  's  too  low <comma> you  're  more  likely  to  make  too  many  type  ii  errors <period> you  miss  the  real  patterns <period> you  do  n't  want  to  be  too  skeptical <period> if  you  're  too  skeptical <comma> you  'll  miss  the  really  interesting  good  ideas <period> just  right <comma> you  're  creative <comma> and  yet  you  do  n't  fall  for  too  much  baloney <period> too  high  and  maybe  you  see  patterns  everywhere <period> every  time  somebody  looks  at  you <comma> you  think  people  are  staring  at  you <period> you  think  people  are  talking  about  you <period> and  if  you  go  too  far  on  that <comma> that  's  just  simply  labeled  as  madness <period> it  's  a  distinction  perhaps  we  might  make  between  two  nobel  laureates <comma> richard  feynman  and  john  nash <period> one  sees  maybe  just  the  right  number  of  patterns  to  win  a  nobel  prize <period> the  other  one  also <comma> but  maybe  too  many  patterns <period> and  we  then  call  that  schizophrenia <period> so  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  then  presents  us  with  a  pattern-detection  problem <period> and  of  course  you  all  know  exactly  what  this  is <comma> right <questionmark> and  what  pattern  do  you  see  here <questionmark> again <comma> i  'm  putting  your  anterior  cingulate  cortex  to  the  test  here <comma> causing  you  conflicting  pattern  detections <period> you  know <comma> of  course <comma> this  is  via  uno  shoes <period> these  are  sandals <period> pretty  sexy  feet <comma> i  must  say <period> maybe  a  little  photoshopped <period> and  of  course <comma> the  ambiguous  figures  that  seem  to  flip-flop  back  and  forth <period> it  turns  out  what  you  're  thinking  about  a  lot  influences  what  you  tend  to  see <period> and  you  see  the  lamp  here <comma> i  know <period> because  the  lights  on  here <period> of  course <comma> thanks  to  the  environmentalist  movement  we  're  all  sensitive  to  the  plight  of  marine  mammals <period> so  what  you  see  in  this  particular  ambiguous  figure  is <comma> of  course <comma> the  dolphins <comma> right <questionmark> you  see  a  dolphin  here <period> and  there  's  a  dolphin <period> and  there  's  a  dolphin <period> that  's  a  dolphin  tail  there <comma> guys <period> if  we  can  give  you  conflicting  data <comma> again <comma> your  acc  is  going  to  be  going  into  hyperdrive <period> if  you  look  down  here <comma> it  's  fine <period> if  you  look  up  here <comma> then  you  get  conflicting  data <period> and  then  we  have  to  flip  the  image  for  you  to  see  that  it  's  a  set  up <period> the  impossible  crate  illusion <period> it  's  easy  to  fool  the  brain  in  2d <period> so  you  say <comma> aw <comma> come  on  shermer <comma> anybody  can  do  that  in  a  psych  101  text  with  an  illusion  like  that <period> well  here  's  the  late <comma> great  jerry  andrus  impossible  crate  illusion  in  3d <comma> in  which  jerry  is  standing  inside  the  impossible  crate <period> and  he  was  kind  enough  to  post  this  and  give  us  the  reveal <period> of  course <comma> camera  angle  is  everything <period> the  photographer  is  over  there <period> and  this  board  appears  to  overlap  with  this  one <comma> and  this  one  with  that  one <comma> and  so  on <period> but  even  when  i  take  it  away <comma> the  illusion  is  so  powerful  because  of  how  are  brains  are  wired  to  find  those  certain  kinds  of  patterns <period> this  is  a  fairly  new  one  that  throws  us  off  because  of  the  conflicting  patterns  of  comparing  this  angle  with  that  angle <period> in  fact <comma> it  's  the  exact  same  picture  side  by  side <period> so  what  you  're  doing  is  comparing  that  angle  instead  of  with  this  one <comma> but  with  that  one <period> and  so  your  brain  is  fooled <period> yet  again <comma> your  pattern  detection  devices  are  fooled <period> faces  are  easy  to  see  because  we  have  an  additional  evolved  facial  recognition  software  in  our  temporal  lobes <period> here  's  some  faces  on  the  side  of  a  rock <period> i  'm  actually  not  even  sure  if  this  is <comma> this  might  be  photoshopped <period> but  anyway <comma> the  point  is  still  made <period> now  which  one  of  these  looks  odd  to  you <questionmark> in  a  quick  reaction <comma> which  one  looks  odd <questionmark> the  one  on  the  left <period> okay <period> so  i  'll  rotate  it  so  it  'll  be  the  one  on  the  right <period> and  you  are  correct <period> a  fairly  famous  illusion <comma> it  was  first  done  with  margaret  thatcher <period> now <comma> they  trade  up  the  politicians  every  time <period> well <comma> why  is  this  happening <questionmark> well <comma> we  know  exactly  where  it  happens <comma> in  the  temporal  lobe <comma> right  across <comma> sort  of  above  your  ear  there <period> in  a  little  structure  called  the  fusiform  gyrus <period> and  there  's  two  types  of  cells  that  do  this <comma> that  record  facial  features  either  globally <comma> or  specifically  these  large <comma> rapid-firing  cells <comma> first  look  at  the  general  face <period> so  you  recognize  obama  immediately <period> and  then  you  notice  something  quite  a  little  bit  odd  about  the  eyes  and  the  mouth <period> especially  when  they  're  upside  down <period> you  're  engaging  that  general  facial  recognition  software  there <period> now  i  said  back  in  our  little  thought  experiment <comma> you  're  a  hominid  walking  on  the  plains  of  africa <period> is  it  just  the  wind  or  a  dangerous  predator <questionmark> what  's  the  difference  between  those <questionmark> well <comma> the  wind  is  inanimate <period> the  dangerous  predator  is  an  intentional  agent <period> and  i  call  this  process  agenticity <period> that  is  the  tendency  to  infuse  patterns  with  meaning <comma> intention  and  agency <comma> often  invisible  beings  from  the  top  down <period> this  is  an  idea  that  we  got  from  a  fellow  tedster  here <comma> dan  dennett <comma> who  talked  about  taking  the  intentional  stance <period> so  it  's  a  type  of  that  expanded  to  explain <comma> i  think <comma> a  lot  of  different  things <comma> souls <comma> spirits <comma> ghosts <comma> gods <comma> demons <comma> angels <comma> aliens <comma> intelligent  designers <comma> government  conspiracists  and  all  manner  of  invisible  agents  with  power  and  intention <comma> are  believed  to  haunt  our  world  and  control  our  lives <period> i  think  it  's  the  basis  of  animism  and  polytheism  and  monotheism <period> it  's  the  belief  that  aliens  are  somehow  more  advanced  than  us <comma> more  moral  than  us <comma> and  the  narratives  always  are  that  they  're  coming  here  to  save  us  and  rescue  us  from  on  high <period> the  intelligent  designer  's  always  portrayed  as  this  super  intelligent <comma> moral  being  that  comes  down  to  design  life <period> even  the  idea  that  government  can  rescue  us  -- <period> that  's  no  longer  the  wave  of  the  future <period> but  that  is <comma> i  think <comma> a  type  of  agenticity <comma> projecting  somebody  up  there <comma> big  and  powerful <comma> will  come  rescue  us <period> and  this  is  also <comma> i  think <comma> the  basis  of  conspiracy  theories <period> there  's  somebody  hiding  behind  there  pulling  the  strings <comma> whether  it  's  the  illuminati  or  the  bilderbergers <period> but  this  is  a  pattern  detection  problem <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> some  patterns  are  real  and  some  are  not <period> was  jfk  assassinated  by  a  conspiracy  or  by  a  lone  assassin <questionmark> well <comma> if  you  go  there <comma> there  's  people  there  on  any  given  day <comma> like  when  i  went  there <comma> here <comma> showing  me  where  the  different  shooters  were <period> my  favorite  one  was  he  was  in  the  manhole <period> and  he  popped  out  at  the  last  second <comma> took  that  shot <period> but  of  course <comma> lincoln  was  assassinated  by  a  conspiracy <period> so  we  cannot  just  uniformly  dismiss  all  patterns  like  that <period> because <comma> let  's  face  it <comma> some  patterns  are  real <period> some  conspiracies  really  are  true <period> explains  a  lot <comma> maybe <period> and  9/11  has  a  conspiracy  theory <period> it  is  a  conspiracy <period> we  did  a  whole  issue  on  it <period> nineteen  members  of  al  queda  plotting  to  fly  planes  into  buildings  constitutes  a  conspiracy <period> but  that  's  not  what  the  9/11  truthers  think <period> they  think  it  was  an  inside  job  by  the  bush  administration <period> well <comma> that  's  a  whole  other  lecture <period> you  know  how  we  know  that  9/11  was  not  orchestrated  by  the  bush  administration <questionmark> because  it  worked <period> so  we  are  natural-born  dualists <period> our  agenticity  process  comes  from  the  fact  that  we  can  enjoy  movies  like  these <period> because  we  can  imagine <comma> in  essence <comma> continuing  on <period> we  know  that  if  you  stimulate  the  temporal  lobe <comma> you  can  produce  a  feeling  of  out-of-body  experiences <comma> near-death  experiences <comma> which  you  can  do  by  just  touching  an  electrode  to  the  temporal  lobe  there <period> or  you  can  do  it  through  loss  of  consciousness <comma> by  accelerating  in  a  centrifuge <period> you  get  a  hypoxia <comma> or  a  lower  oxygen <period> and  the  brain  then  senses  that  there  's  an  out-of-body  experience <period> you  can  use <comma> which  i  did <comma> went  out  and  did <comma> michael  persinger  's  god  helmet <comma> that  bombards  your  temporal  lobes  with  electromagnetic  waves <period> and  you  get  a  sense  of  out-of-body  experience <period> so  i  'm  going  to  end  here  with  a  short  video  clip  that  sort  of  brings  all  this  together <period> it  's  just  a  minute  and  a  half <period> it  ties  together  all  this  into  the  power  of  expectation  and  the  power  of  belief <period> go  ahead  and  roll  it <period> narrator <comma> this  is  the  venue  they  chose  for  their  fake  auditions  for  an  advert  for  lip  balm <period> woman <comma> we  're  hoping  we  can  use  part  of  this  in  a  national  commercial <comma> right <questionmark> and  this  is  test  on  some  lip  balms  that  we  have  over  here <period> and  these  are  our  models  who  are  going  to  help  us <comma> roger  and  matt <period> and  we  have  our  own  lip  balm <comma> and  we  have  a  leading  brand <period> would  you  have  any  problem  kissing  our  models  to  test  it <questionmark> girl <comma> no <period> woman <comma> you  would  n't <questionmark> woman <comma> you'd  think  that  was  fine <period> girl <comma> that  would  be  fine <period> so  this  is  a  blind  test <period> i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  go  ahead  and  put  a  blindfold  on <period> kay <comma> now  can  you  see  anything <questionmark> pull  it  so  you  cannot  even  see  down <period> woman <comma> it  's  completely  blind  now <comma> right <questionmark> girl <comma> yes <period> now <comma> what  i  'm  going  to  be  looking  for  in  this  test  is  how  it  protects  your  lips <comma> the  texture <comma> right <comma> and  maybe  if  you  can  discern  any  flavor  or  not <period> girl <comma> okay <period> girl <comma> no <period> woman <comma> take  a  step  here <period> okay <comma> now  i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  pucker  up <period> pucker  up  big  and  lean  in  just  a  little  bit <comma> okay <questionmark> woman <comma> okay <period> and <comma> jennifer <comma> how  did  that  feel <questionmark> jennifer <comma> good <period> girl <comma> oh  my  god <period> michael  shermer <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> thank  you <period> thanks <period> it  's  hard  to  believe  that  it  's  less  than  a  year  since  the  extraordinary  moment  when  the  finance <comma> the  credit <comma> which  drives  our  economies  froze <period> a  massive  cardiac  arrest <period> the  effect <comma> the  payback <comma> perhaps <comma> for  years  of  vampire  predators  like  bernie  madoff <period> whom  we  saw  earlier <period> abuse  of  steroids <comma> binging  and  so  on <period> and  it  's  only  a  few  months  since  governments  injected  enormous  sums  of  money  to  try  and  keep  the  whole  system  afloat <period> and  we  're  now  in  a  very  strange  sort  of  twilight  zone <comma> where  no  one  quite  knows  what  's  worked <comma> or  what  does  n't <period> we  do  n't  have  any  very  clear  maps <comma> any  compass  to  guide  us <period> we  do  n't  know  which  experts  to  believe  anymore <period> what  i  'm  going  to  try  and  do  is  to  give  some  pointers  to  what  i  think  is  the  landscape  on  the  other  side  of  the  crisis <comma> what  things  we  should  be  looking  out  for  and  how  we  can  actually  use  the  crisis <period> there  's  a  definition  of  leadership  which  says <comma> it  's  the  ability  to  use  the  smallest  possible  crisis  for  the  biggest  possible  effect <period> and  i  want  to  talk  about  how  we  ensure  that  this  crisis <comma> which  is  by  no  means  small <comma> really  is  used  to  the  full <period> i  want  to  start  just  by  saying  a  bit  about  where  i  'm  coming  from <period> i've  got  a  very  confused  background  which  perhaps  makes  me  appropriate  for  confused  times <period> i've  got  a  phd <period> in  telecoms <comma> as  you  can  see <period> i  trained  briefly  as  a  buddhist  monk  under  this  guy <period> i've  been  a  civil  servant <comma> and  i've  been  in  charge  of  policy  for  this  guy  as  well <period> but  what  i  want  to  talk  about  begins  when  i  was  at  this  city <comma> this  university <comma> as  a  student <period> and  then  as  now <comma> it  was  a  beautiful  place  of  balls  and  punts <comma> beautiful  people <comma> many  of  whom  took  to  heart  ronald  reagan  's  comment  that <comma> even  if  they  say  hard  work  does  n't  do  you  any  harm <comma> why  risk  it <questionmark> but  when  i  was  here <comma> a  lot  of  my  fellow  teenagers  were  in  a  very  different  situation <comma> leaving  school  at  a  time  then  of  rapidly  growing  youth  unemployment <comma> and  essentially  hitting  a  brick  wall  in  terms  of  their  opportunities <period> and  i  spent  quite  a  lot  of  time  with  them  rather  than  in  punts <period> and  they  were  people  who  were  not  short  of  wit <comma> or  grace  or  energy <comma> but  they  had  no  hope <comma> no  jobs <comma> no  prospects <period> and  when  people  are  n't  allowed  to  be  useful <comma> they  soon  think  that  they  're  useless <period> and  although  that  was  great  for  the  music  business  at  the  time <comma> it  was  n't  much  good  for  anything  else <period> and  ever  since  then <comma> i've  wondered  why  it  is  that  capitalism  is  so  amazingly  efficient  at  some  things <comma> but  so  inefficient  at  others <comma> why  it  's  so  innovative  in  some  ways  and  so  un-innovative  in  others <period> now <comma> since  that  time <comma> we've  actually  been  through  an  extraordinary  boom <comma> the  longest  boom  ever  in  the  history  of  this  country <period> unprecedented  wealth  and  prosperity <period> but  that  growth  has  n't  always  delivered  what  we  needed <period> hl <period> mencken  once  said  that <comma> to  every  complex  problem <comma> there  is  a  simple  solution  and  it  's  wrong <period> but  i  'm  not  saying  growth  is  wrong <comma> but  it  's  very  striking  that  throughout  the  years  of  growth <comma> many  things  did  n't  get  better <period> rates  of  depression  carried  on  up <comma> right  across  the  western  world <period> if  you  look  at  america <comma> the  proportion  of  americans  with  no  one  to  talk  to  about  important  things  went  up  from  a  tenth  to  a  quarter <period> we  commuted  longer  to  work <comma> but  as  you  can  see  from  this  graph <comma> the  longer  you  commute  the  less  happy  you  're  likely  to  be <period> and  it  became  ever  clearer  that  economic  growth  does  n't  automatically  translate  into  social  growth  or  human  growth <period> we  're  now  at  another  moment  when  another  wave  of  teenagers  are  entering  a  cruel  job  market <period> there  will  be  a  million  unemployed  young  people  here  by  the  end  of  the  year <period> thousands  losing  their  jobs  everyday  in  america <period> we've  got  to  do  whatever  we  can  to  help  them <period> but  we've  also  got  to  ask <comma> i  think <comma> a  more  profound  question  of  whether  we  use  this  crisis  to  jump  forward  to  a  different  kind  of  economy  that  's  more  suited  to  human  needs <comma> to  a  better  balance  of  economy  and  society <period> and  i  think  one  of  the  lessons  of  history  is  that  even  the  deepest  crises  can  be  moments  of  opportunity <period> they  bring  ideas  from  the  margins  into  the  mainstream <period> they  often  lead  to  the  acceleration  of  much-needed  reforms <period> and  you  saw  that  in  the  30s <comma> when  the  great  depression  paved  the  way  for  bretton  woods <comma> welfare  states  and  so  on <period> and  i  think  you  can  see  around  us  now <comma> some  of  the  green  shoots  of  a  very  different  kind  of  economy  and  capitalism  which  could  grow <period> you  can  see  it  in  daily  life <period> when  times  are  hard <comma> people  have  to  do  things  for  themselves <comma> and  right  across  the  world <comma> oxford <comma> omaha <comma> omsk <comma> you  can  see  an  extraordinary  explosion  of  urban  farming <comma> people  taking  over  land <comma> taking  over  roofs <comma> turning  barges  into  temporary  farms <period> and  i  'm  a  very  small  part  of  this <period> i  have  60,000  of  these  things  in  my  garden <period> a  few  of  these <period> this  is  atilla  the  hen <period> and  i  'm  a  very  small  part  of  a  very  large  movement <comma> which  for  some  people  is  about  survival <comma> but  is  also  about  values <comma> about  a  different  kind  of  economy <comma> which  is  n't  so  much  about  consumption  and  credit <comma> but  about  things  which  matter  to  us <period> and  everywhere  too <comma> you  can  see  a  proliferation  of  time  banks  and  parallel  currencies <comma> people  using  smart  technologies  to  link  up  all  the  resources  freed  up  by  the  market <comma> people <comma> buildings <comma> land <comma> and  linking  them  to  whomever  has  got  the  most  compelling  needs <period> there  's  a  similar  story <comma> i  think <comma> for  governments <period> ronald  reagan <comma> again <comma> said  the  two  funniest  sentences  in  the  english  language  are <comma> i  'm  from  the  government <period> and  i  'm  here  to  help <period> but  i  think  last  year  when  governments  did  step  in <comma> people  were  quite  glad  that  they  were  there <comma> that  they  did  act <period> but  now <comma> a  few  months  on <comma> however  good  politicians  are  at  swallowing  frogs  without  pulling  a  face <comma> as  someone  once  put  it <comma> they  cannot  hide  their  uncertainty <period> because  it  's  already  clear  how  much  of  the  enormous  amount  of  money  they  put  into  the  economy <comma> really  went  into  fixing  the  past <comma> bailing  out  the  banks <comma> the  car  companies <comma> not  preparing  us  for  the  future <period> how  much  of  the  money  is  going  into  concrete  and  boosting  consumption <comma> not  into  solving  the  really  profound  problems  we  have  to  solve <period> and  everywhere <comma> as  people  think  about  the  unprecedented  sums  which  are  being  spent  of  our  money  and  our  children  's  money <comma> now <comma> in  the  depth  of  this  crisis <comma> they  're  asking <comma> surely <comma> we  should  be  using  this  with  a  longer-term  vision  to  accelerate  the  shift  to  a  green  economy <comma> to  prepare  for  aging <comma> to  deal  with  some  of  the  inequalities  which  scar  countries  like  this  and  the  united  states  rather  than  just  giving  the  money  to  the  incumbents <questionmark> surely <comma> we  should  be  giving  the  money  to  entrepreneurs <comma> to  civil  society <comma> for  people  able  to  create  the  new <comma> not  to  the  big <comma> well-connected  companies <comma> big <comma> clunky  government  programs <period> and <comma> after  all  this <comma> as  the  great  chinese  sage  lao  tzu  said <comma> governing  a  great  country  is  like  cooking  a  small  fish <period> do  n't  overdo  it <period> and  i  think  more  and  more  people  are  also  asking <comma> why  boost  consumption <comma> rather  than  change  what  we  consume <questionmark> like  the  mayor  of  são  paulo  who  's  banned  advertising  billboards <comma> or  the  many  cities  like  san  francisco  putting  in  infrastructures  for  electric  cars <period> you  can  see  a  bit  of  the  same  thing  happening  in  the  business  world <period> some <comma> i  think  some  of  the  bankers  who  have  appear  to  have  learned  nothing  and  forgotten  nothing <period> but  ask  yourselves <comma> what  will  be  the  biggest  sectors  of  the  economy  in  10 <comma> 20 <comma> 30  years  time <questionmark> it  wo  n't  be  the  ones  lining  up  for  handouts <comma> like  cars  and  aerospace  and  so  on <period> the  biggest  sector <comma> by  far <comma> will  be  health <comma> already  18  percent  of  the  american  economy <comma> predicted  to  grow  to  30 <comma> even  40  percent  by  mid-century <period> elder  care <comma> child  care <comma> already  much  bigger  employers  than  cars <period> education <comma> six <comma> seven <comma> eight  percent  of  the  economy  and  growing <period> environmental  services <comma> energy  services <comma> the  myriad  of  green  jobs <comma> they  're  all  pointing  to  a  very  different  kind  of  economy  which  is  n't  just  about  products <comma> but  is  using  distributed  networks <comma> and  it  's  founded  above  all  on  care <comma> on  relationships <period> on  what  people  do  to  other  people <comma> often  one  to  one <comma> rather  than  simply  selling  them  a  product <period> and  i  think  that  what  connects  the  challenge  for  civil  society <comma> the  challenge  for  governments  and  the  challenge  for  business  now  is <comma> in  a  way <comma> a  very  simple  one <comma> but  quite  a  difficult  one <period> we  know  our  societies  have  to  radically  change <period> we  know  we  cannot  go  back  to  where  we  were  before  the  crisis <period> but  we  also  know  it  's  only  through  experiment  that  we  'll  discover  exactly  how  to  run  a  low  carbon  city <comma> how  to  care  for  a  much  older  population <comma> how  to  deal  with  drug  addiction  and  so  on <period> and  here  's  the  problem <period> in  science <comma> we  do  experiments  systematically <period> our  societies  now  spend  two <comma> three <comma> four  percent  of  gdp  to  invest  systematically  in  new  discovery <comma> in  science <comma> in  technology <comma> to  fuel  the  pipeline  of  brilliant  inventions  which  illuminate  gatherings  like  this <period> it  's  not  that  our  scientists  are  necessarily  much  smarter  than  they  were  a  hundred  years  ago <comma> maybe  they  are <comma> but  they  have  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  backing  than  they  ever  did <period> and  what  's  striking  though <comma> is  that  in  society  there  's  almost  nothing  comparable <comma> no  comparable  investment <comma> no  systematic  experiment <comma> in  the  things  capitalism  is  n't  very  good  at <comma> like  compassion <comma> or  empathy <comma> or  relationships  or  care <period> now <comma> i  did  n't  really  understand  that  until  i  met  this  guy  who  was  then  an  80-year-old <comma> slightly  shambolic  man  who  lived  on  tomato  soup  and  thought  ironing  was  very  overrated <period> he  had  helped  shape  britain  's  post-war  institutions <comma> its  welfare  state <comma> its  economy <comma> but  had  sort  of  reinvented  himself  as  a  social  entrepreneur <comma> became  an  inventor  of  many <comma> many  different  organizations <period> some  famous  ones  like  the  open  university <comma> which  has  110,000  students <comma> the  university  of  the  third  age <comma> which  has  nearly  half  a  million  older  people  teaching  other  older  people <comma> as  well  as  strange  things  like  diy  garages  and  language  lines  and  schools  for  social  entrepreneurs <period> and  he  ended  his  life  selling  companies  to  venture  capitalists <period> he  believed  if  you  see  a  problem <comma> you  should  n't  tell  someone  to  act <comma> you  should  act  on  it  yourself <comma> and  he  lived  long  enough  and  saw  enough  of  his  ideas  first  scorned  and  then  succeed  that  he  said  you  should  always  take  no  as  a  question  and  not  as  an  answer <period> and  his  life  was  a  systematic  experiment  to  find  better  social  answers <comma> not  from  a  theory <comma> but  from  experiment <comma> and  experiment  involving  the  people  with  the  best  intelligence  on  social  needs <comma> which  were  usually  the  people  living  with  those  needs <period> and  he  believed  we  live  with  others <comma> we  share  the  world  with  others  and  therefore  our  innovation  must  be  done  with  others  too <comma> not  doing  things  at  people <comma> for  them <comma> and  so  on <period> now <comma> what  he  did  did  n't  used  to  have  a  name <comma> but  i  think  it  's  rapidly  becoming  quite  mainstream <period> it  's  what  we  do  in  the  organization  named  after  him  where  we  try  and  invent <comma> create <comma> launch  new  ventures <comma> whether  it  's  schools <comma> web  companies <comma> health  organizations  and  so  on <period> and  we  find  ourselves  part  of  a  very  rapidly  growing  global  movement  of  institutions  working  on  social  innovation <comma> using  ideas  from  design  or  technology  or  community  organizing  to  develop  the  germs  of  a  future  world <comma> but  through  practice  and  through  demonstration  and  not  through  theory <period> and  they  're  spreading  from  korea  to  brazil  to  india  to  the  usa  and  across  europe <period> and  they've  been  given  new  momentum  by  the  crisis <comma> by  the  need  for  better  answers  to  joblessness <comma> community  breakdown  and  so  on <period> some  of  the  ideas  are  strange <period> these  are  complaints  choirs <period> people  come  together  to  sing  about  the  things  that  really  bug  them <period> others  are  much  more  pragmatic <comma> health  coaches <comma> learning  mentors <comma> job  clubs <period> and  some  are  quite  structural <comma> like  social  impact  bonds  where  you  raise  money  to  invest  in  diverting  teenagers  from  crime  or  helping  old  people  keep  out  of  hospital <comma> and  you  get  paid  back  according  to  how  successful  your  projects  are <period> now <comma> the  idea  that  all  of  this  represents <comma> i  think <comma> is  rapidly  becoming  a  common  sense  and  part  of  how  we  respond  to  the  crisis <comma> recognizing  the  need  to  invest  in  innovation  for  social  progress  as  well  as  technological  progress <period> there  were  big  health  innovation  funds  launched  earlier  this  year  in  this  country <comma> as  well  as  a  public  service  innovation  lab <period> across  northern  europe <comma> many  governments  now  have  innovation  laboratories  within  them <period> and  just  a  few  months  ago <comma> president  obama  launched  the  office  of  social  innovation  in  the  white  house <period> and  what  people  are  beginning  to  ask  is <comma> surely <comma> just  as  we  invest  in  r  and  d <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four  percent <comma> of  our  gdp <comma> of  our  economy <comma> what  if  we  put <comma> let  's  say <comma> one  percent  of  public  spending  into  social  innovation <comma> into  elder  care <comma> new  kinds  of  education <comma> new  ways  of  helping  the  disabled <questionmark> perhaps  we'd  achieve  similar  productivity  gains  in  society  to  those  we've  had  in  the  economy  and  in  technology <period> and  if <comma> a  generation  or  two  ago <comma> the  big  challenges  were  ones  like  getting  a  man  on  the  moon <comma> perhaps  the  challenges  we  need  to  set  ourselves  now  are  ones  like  eliminating  child  malnutrition <comma> stopping  trafficking <comma> or  one <comma> i  think  closer  to  home  for  america  or  europe <comma> why  do  n't  we  set  ourselves  the  goal  of  achieving  a  billion  extra  years  of  life  for  today  's  citizens <period> now  those  are  all  goals  which  could  be  achieved  within  a  decade <comma> but  only  with  radical  and  systematic  experiment <comma> not  just  with  technologies <comma> but  also  with  lifestyles  and  culture  and  policies  and  institutions  too <period> now <comma> i  want  to  end  by  saying  a  little  bit  about  what  i  think  this  means  for  capitalism <period> i  think  what  this  is  all  about <comma> this  whole  movement  which  is  growing  from  the  margins <comma> remains  quite  small <period> nothing  like  the  resources  of  a  cern  or  a  darpa  or  an  ibm  or  a  dupont <period> what  it  's  telling  us  is  that  capitalism  is  going  to  become  more  social <period> it  's  already  immersed  in  social  networks <period> it  will  become  more  involved  in  social  investment <comma> and  social  care  and  in  industries  where  the  value  comes  from  what  you  do  with  others <comma> not  just  from  what  you  sell  to  them <comma> and  from  relationships  as  well  as  from  consumption <period> but  interestingly  too <comma> it  implies  a  future  where  society  learns  a  few  tricks  from  capitalism  about  how  you  embed  the  dna  of  restless  continual  innovation  into  society <comma> trying  things  out  and  then  growing  and  scaling  the  ones  that  work <period> now <comma> i  think  this  future  will  be  quite  surprising  to  many  people <period> in  recent  years <comma> a  lot  of  intelligent  people  thought  that  capitalism  had  basically  won <period> history  was  over  and  society  would  inevitably  have  to  take  second  place  to  economy <period> but  i've  been  struck  with  a  parallel  in  how  people  often  talk  about  capitalism  today  and  how  they  talked  about  the  monarchy  200  years  ago <comma> just  after  the  french  revolution  and  the  restoration  of  the  monarchy  in  france <period> then <comma> people  said  monarchy  dominated  everywhere  because  it  was  rooted  in  human  nature <period> we  were  naturally  deferential <period> we  needed  hierarchy <period> just  as  today <comma> the  enthusiasts  of  unrestrained  capitalism  say  it  's  rooted  in  human  nature <comma> only  now  it  's  individualism <comma> inquisitiveness <comma> and  so  on <period> then  monarchy  had  seen  off  its  big  challenger <comma> mass  democracy <comma> which  was  seen  as  a  well-intentioned  but  doomed  experiment <period> just  as  capitalism  has  seen  off  socialism <period> even  fidel  castro  now  says  that  the  only  thing  worse  than  being  exploited  by  multinational  capitalism  is  not  being  exploited  by  multinational  capitalism <period> and  whereas  then  monarchies <comma> palaces  and  forts  dominated  every  city  skyline  and  looked  permanent  and  confident <comma> today  it  's  the  gleaming  towers  of  the  banks  which  dominate  every  big  city <period> i  'm  not  suggesting  the  crowds  are  about  to  storm  the  barricades  and  string  up  every  investment  banker  from  the  nearest  lamppost <comma> though  that  might  be  quite  tempting <period> but  i  do  think  we  're  on  the  verge  of  a  period  when <comma> just  as  happened  to  the  monarchy  and <comma> interestingly <comma> the  military  too <comma> the  central  position  of  finance  capital  is  going  to  come  to  an  end <comma> and  it  's  going  to  steadily  move  to  the  sides <comma> the  margins  of  our  society <comma> transformed  from  being  a  master  into  a  servant <comma> a  servant  to  the  productive  economy  and  of  human  needs <period> and  as  that  happens <comma> we  will  remember  something  very  simple  and  obvious  about  capitalism <comma> which  is  that <comma> unlike  what  you  read  in  economics  textbooks <comma> it  's  not  a  self-sufficient  system <period> it  depends  on  other  systems <comma> on  ecology <comma> on  family <comma> on  community <comma> and  if  these  are  n't  replenished <comma> capitalism  suffers  too <period> and  our  human  nature  is  n't  just  selfish <comma> it  's  also  compassionate <period> it  's  not  just  competitive <comma> it  's  also  caring <period> because  of  the  depth  of  the  crisis <comma> i  think  we  are  at  a  moment  of  choice <period> the  crisis  is  almost  certainly  deepening  around  us <period> it  will  be  worse  at  the  end  of  this  year <comma> quite  possibly  worse  in  a  year  's  time  than  it  is  today <period> but  this  is  one  of  those  very  rare  moments  when  we  have  to  choose  whether  we  're  just  pedaling  furiously  to  get  back  to  where  we  were  a  year  or  two  ago <comma> and  a  very  narrow  idea  of  what  the  economy  is  for <comma> or  whether  this  is  a  moment  to  jump  ahead <comma> to  reboot  and  to  do  some  of  the  things  we  probably  should  have  been  doing  anyway <period> thank  you <period> this  is  the  large  hadron  collider <period> it  's  27  kilometers  in  circumference <period> it  's  the  biggest  scientific  experiment  ever  attempted <period> over  10,000  physicists  and  engineers  from  85  countries  around  the  world  have  come  together  over  several  decades  to  build  this  machine <period> what  we  do  is  we  accelerate  protons <comma> so <comma> hydrogen  nuclei <comma> around  99999999 <period> percent  the  speed  of  light <period> right <questionmark> at  that  speed <comma> they  go  around  that  27  kilometers  11,000  times  a  second <period> and  we  collide  them  with  another  beam  of  protons  going  in  the  opposite  direction <period> we  collide  them  inside  giant  detectors <period> they  're  essentially  digital  cameras <period> and  this  is  the  one  that  i  work  on <comma> atlas <period> you  get  some  sense  of  the  size <comma> you  can  just  see  these  eu  standard-size  people  underneath <period> you  get  some  sense  of  the  size <comma> 44  meters  wide <comma> 22  meters  in  diameter <comma> 7,000  tons <period> and  we  re-create  the  conditions  that  were  present  less  than  a  billionth  of  a  second  after  the  universe  began  up  to  600  million  times  a  second  inside  that  detector <comma> immense  numbers <period> and  if  you  see  those  metal  bits  there <comma> those  are  huge  magnets  that  bend  electrically  charged  particles <comma> so  it  can  measure  how  fast  they  're  traveling <period> this  is  a  picture  about  a  year  ago <period> those  magnets  are  in  there <period> and <comma> again <comma> a  eu  standard-size <comma> real  person <comma> so  you  get  some  sense  of  the  scale <period> and  it  's  in  there  that  those  mini-big  bangs  will  be  created <comma> sometime  in  the  summer  this  year <period> and  actually <comma> this  morning <comma> i  got  an  email  saying  that  we've  just  finished <comma> today <comma> building  the  last  piece  of  atlas <period> so  as  of  today <comma> it  's  finished <period> i'd  like  to  say  that  i  planned  that  for  ted <comma> but  i  did  n't <period> so  it  's  been  completed  as  of  today <period> yeah <comma> it  's  a  wonderful  achievement <period> so <comma> you  might  be  asking <comma> why <questionmark> why  create  the  conditions  that  were  present  less  than  a  billionth  of  a  second  after  the  universe  began <questionmark> well <comma> particle  physicists  are  nothing  if  not  ambitious <period> and  the  aim  of  particle  physics  is  to  understand  what  everything  's  made  of <comma> and  how  everything  sticks  together <period> and  by  everything  i  mean <comma> of  course <comma> me  and  you <comma> the  earth <comma> the  sun <comma> the  100  billion  suns  in  our  galaxy  and  the  100  billion  galaxies  in  the  observable  universe <period> absolutely  everything <period> now  you  might  say <comma> well <comma> ok <comma> but  why  not  just  look  at  it <questionmark> you  know <questionmark> if  you  want  to  know  what  i  'm  made  of <comma> let  's  look  at  me <period> well <comma> we  found  that  as  you  look  back  in  time <comma> the  universe  gets  hotter  and  hotter <comma> denser  and  denser <comma> and  simpler  and  simpler <period> now <comma> there  's  no  real  reason  i  'm  aware  of  for  that <comma> but  that  seems  to  be  the  case <period> so <comma> way  back  in  the  early  times  of  the  universe <comma> we  believe  it  was  very  simple  and  understandable <period> all  this  complexity <comma> all  the  way  to  these  wonderful  things <comma> human  brains <comma> are  a  property  of  an  old  and  cold  and  complicated  universe <period> back  at  the  start <comma> in  the  first  billionth  of  a  second <comma> we  believe <comma> or  we've  observed <comma> it  was  very  simple <period> it  's  almost  like <period> imagine  a  snowflake  in  your  hand <comma> and  you  look  at  it <comma> and  it  's  an  incredibly  complicated <comma> beautiful  object <period> but  as  you  heat  it  up <comma> it  'll  melt  into  a  pool  of  water <comma> and  you  would  be  able  to  see  that <comma> actually <comma> it  was  just  made  of  h20 <comma> water <period> so  it  's  in  that  same  sense  that  we  look  back  in  time  to  understand  what  the  universe  is  made  of <period> and <comma> as  of  today <comma> it  's  made  of  these  things <period> just  12  particles  of  matter <comma> stuck  together  by  four  forces  of  nature <period> the  quarks <comma> these  pink  things <comma> are  the  things  that  make  up  protons  and  neutrons  that  make  up  the  atomic  nuclei  in  your  body <period> the  electron <comma> the  thing  that  goes  around  the  atomic  nucleus <comma> held  around  in  orbit <comma> by  the  way <comma> by  the  electromagnetic  force  that  's  carried  by  this  thing <comma> the  photon <period> the  quarks  are  stuck  together  by  other  things  called  gluons <period> and  these  guys <comma> here <comma> they  're  the  weak  nuclear  force <comma> probably  the  least  familiar <period> but <comma> without  it <comma> the  sun  would  n't  shine <period> and  when  the  sun  shines <comma> you  get  copious  quantities  of  these  things <comma> called  neutrinos <comma> pouring  out <period> actually <comma> if  you  just  look  at  your  thumbnail <comma> about  a  square  centimeter <comma> there  are  something  like  60  billion  neutrinos  per  second  from  the  sun <comma> passing  through  every  square  centimeter  of  your  body <period> but  you  do  n't  feel  them <comma> because  the  weak  force  is  correctly  named  -- <period> very  short  range  and  very  weak <comma> so  they  just  fly  through  you <period> and  these  particles  have  been  discovered  over  the  last  century <comma> pretty  much <period> the  first  one <comma> the  electron <comma> was  discovered  in  1897 <comma> and  the  last  one <comma> this  thing  called  the  tau  neutrino <comma> in  the  year  2000 <period> actually  just <comma> i  was  going  to  say <comma> just  up  the  road  in  chicago <period> i  know  it  's  a  big  country <comma> america <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> just  up  the  road <period> relative  to  the  universe <comma> it  's  just  up  the  road <period> so <comma> this  thing  was  discovered  in  the  year  2000 <comma> so  it  's  a  relatively  recent  picture <period> one  of  the  wonderful  things <comma> actually <comma> i  find <comma> is  that  we've  discovered  any  of  them <comma> when  you  realize  how  tiny  they  are <period> you  know <comma> they  're  a  step  in  size  from  the  entire  observable  universe <period> so <comma> 100  billion  galaxies <comma> 137  billion  light  years  away <comma> a  step  in  size  from  that  to  monterey <comma> actually <comma> is  about  the  same  as  from  monterey  to  these  things <period> absolutely <comma> exquisitely  minute <comma> and  yet  we've  discovered  pretty  much  the  full  set <period> so <comma> one  of  my  most  illustrious  forebears  at  manchester  university <comma> ernest  rutherford <comma> discoverer  of  the  atomic  nucleus <comma> once  said <comma> all  science  is  either  physics  or  stamp  collecting <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  think  he  meant  to  insult  the  rest  of  science <comma> although  he  was  from  new  zealand <comma> so  it  's  possible <period> but  what  he  meant  was  that  what  we've  done <comma> really <comma> is  stamp  collect  there <period> ok <comma> we've  discovered  the  particles <comma> but  unless  you  understand  the  underlying  reason  for  that  pattern <comma> you  know <comma> why  it  's  built  the  way  it  is <comma> really  you've  done  stamp  collecting <period> you  have  n't  done  science <period> fortunately <comma> we  have  probably  one  of  the  greatest  scientific  achievements  of  the  twentieth  century  that  underpins  that  pattern <period> it  's  the  newton  's  laws <comma> if  you  want <comma> of  particle  physics <period> it  's  called  the  standard  model <comma> beautifully  simple  mathematical  equation <period> you  could  stick  it  on  the  front  of  a  t-shirt <comma> which  is  always  the  sign  of  elegance <period> this  is  it <period> i've  been  a  little  disingenuous <comma> because  i've  expanded  it  out  in  all  its  gory  detail <period> this  equation <comma> though <comma> allows  you  to  calculate  everything <comma> other  than  gravity <comma> that  happens  in  the  universe <period> so <comma> you  want  to  know  why  the  sky  is  blue <comma> why  atomic  nuclei  stick  together <comma> in  principle <comma> you've  got  a  big  enough  computer <comma> why  dna  is  the  shape  it  is <period> in  principle <comma> you  should  be  able  to  calculate  it  from  that  equation <period> but  there  's  a  problem <period> can  anyone  see  what  it  is <questionmark> a  bottle  of  champagne  for  anyone  that  tells  me <period> i  'll  make  it  easier <comma> actually <comma> by  blowing  one  of  the  lines  up <period> basically <comma> each  of  these  terms  refers  to  some  of  the  particles <period> so  those  ws  there  refer  to  the  ws <comma> and  how  they  stick  together <period> these  carriers  of  the  weak  force <comma> the  zs <comma> the  same <period> but  there  's  an  extra  symbol  in  this  equation <comma> h <period> right <comma> h <period> h  stands  for  higgs  particle <period> higgs  particles  have  not  been  discovered <period> but  they  're  necessary <comma> they  're  necessary  to  make  that  mathematics  work <period> so  all  the  exquisitely  detailed  calculations  we  can  do  with  that  wonderful  equation  would  n't  be  possible  without  an  extra  bit <period> so  it  's  a  prediction <comma> a  prediction  of  a  new  particle <period> what  does  it  do <questionmark> well <comma> we  had  a  long  time  to  come  up  with  good  analogies <period> and  back  in  the  1980s <comma> when  we  wanted  the  money  for  the  lhc  from  the  uk <period> government <comma> margaret  thatcher <comma> at  the  time <comma> said <comma> if  you  guys  can  explain <comma> in  language  a  politician  can  understand <comma> what  the  hell  it  is  that  you  're  doing <comma> you  can  have  the  money <period> i  want  to  know  what  this  higgs  particle  does <period> and  we  came  up  with  this  analogy <comma> and  it  seemed  to  work <period> well <comma> what  the  higgs  does  is <comma> it  gives  mass  to  the  fundamental  particles <period> and  the  picture  is  that  the  whole  universe <comma> and  that  does  n't  mean  just  space <comma> it  means  me  as  well <comma> and  inside  you <comma> the  whole  universe  is  full  of  something  called  a  higgs  field <period> higgs  particles <comma> if  you  will <period> the  analogy  is  that  these  people  in  a  room  are  the  higgs  particles <period> now  when  a  particle  moves  through  the  universe <comma> it  can  interact  with  these  higgs  particles <period> but  imagine  someone  who  's  not  very  popular  moves  through  the  room <period> then  everyone  ignores  them <period> they  can  just  pass  through  the  room  very  quickly <comma> essentially  at  the  speed  of  light <period> they  're  massless <period> and  imagine  someone  incredibly  important  and  popular  and  intelligent  walks  into  the  room <period> they  're  surrounded  by  people <comma> and  their  passage  through  the  room  is  impeded <period> it  's  almost  like  they  get  heavy <period> they  get  massive <period> and  that  's  exactly  the  way  the  higgs  mechanism  works <period> the  picture  is  that  the  electrons  and  the  quarks  in  your  body  and  in  the  universe  that  we  see  around  us  are  heavy <comma> in  a  sense <comma> and  massive <comma> because  they  're  surrounded  by  higgs  particles <period> they  're  interacting  with  the  higgs  field <period> if  that  picture  's  true <comma> then  we  have  to  discover  those  higgs  particles  at  the  lhc <period> if  it  's  not  true <comma> because  it  's  quite  a  convoluted  mechanism <comma> although  it  's  the  simplest  we've  been  able  to  think  of <comma> then  whatever  does  the  job  of  the  higgs  particles  we  know  have  to  turn  up  at  the  lhc <period> so <comma> that  's  one  of  the  prime  reasons  we  built  this  giant  machine <period> i  'm  glad  you  recognize  margaret  thatcher <period> actually <comma> i  thought  about  making  it  more  culturally  relevant <comma> but <comma> anyway <period> so  that  's  one  thing <period> that  's  essentially  a  guarantee  of  what  the  lhc  will  find <period> there  are  many  other  things <period> you've  heard  many  of  the  big  problems  in  particle  physics <period> one  of  them  you  heard  about <comma> dark  matter <comma> dark  energy <period> there  's  another  issue <comma> which  is  that  the  forces  in  nature <comma> it  's  quite  beautiful <comma> actually <comma> seem <comma> as  you  go  back  in  time <comma> they  seem  to  change  in  strength <period> well <comma> they  do  change  in  strength <period> so <comma> the  electromagnetic  force <comma> the  force  that  holds  us  together <comma> gets  stronger  as  you  go  to  higher  temperatures <period> the  strong  force <comma> the  strong  nuclear  force <comma> which  sticks  nuclei  together <comma> gets  weaker <period> and  what  you  see  is  the  standard  model <comma> you  can  calculate  how  these  change <comma> is  the  forces <comma> the  three  forces <comma> other  than  gravity <comma> almost  seem  to  come  together  at  one  point <period> it  's  almost  as  if  there  was  one  beautiful  kind  of  super-force <comma> back  at  the  beginning  of  time <period> but  they  just  miss <period> now  there  's  a  theory  called  super-symmetry <comma> which  doubles  the  number  of  particles  in  the  standard  model <period> which <comma> at  first  sight <comma> does  n't  sound  like  a  simplification <period> but  actually <comma> with  this  theory <comma> we  find  that  the  forces  of  nature  do  seem  to  unify  together <comma> back  at  the  big  bang  -- <period> absolutely  beautiful  prophecy <period> the  model  was  n't  built  to  do  that <comma> but  it  seems  to  do  it <period> also <comma> those  super-symmetric  particles  are  very  strong  candidates  for  the  dark  matter <period> so  a  very  compelling  theory  that  's  really  mainstream  physics <period> and  if  i  was  to  put  money  on  it <comma> i  would  put  money  on <comma> in  a  very  unscientific  way <comma> that  that  these  things  would  also  crop  up  at  the  lhc <period> many  other  things  that  the  lhc  could  discover <period> but  in  the  last  few  minutes <comma> i  just  want  to  give  you  a  different  perspective  of  what  i  think <comma> what  particle  physics  really  means  to  me <comma> particle  physics  and  cosmology <period> and  that  's  that  i  think  it  's  given  us  a  wonderful  narrative <comma> almost  a  creation  story <comma> if  you'd  like <comma> about  the  universe <comma> from  modern  science  over  the  last  few  decades <period> and  i'd  say  that  it  deserves <comma> in  the  spirit  of  wade  davis  talk <comma> to  be  at  least  put  up  there  with  these  wonderful  creation  stories  of  the  peoples  of  the  high  andes  and  the  frozen  north <period> this  is  a  creation  story <comma> i  think <comma> equally  as  wonderful <period> the  story  goes  like  this <comma> we  know  that  the  universe  began  137  billion  years  ago <comma> in  an  immensely  hot <comma> dense  state <comma> much  smaller  than  a  single  atom <period> it  began  to  expand  about  a  million <comma> billion <comma> billion <comma> billion  billionth  of  a  second <comma> i  think  i  got  that  right <comma> after  the  big  bang <period> gravity  separated  away  from  the  other  forces <period> the  universe  then  underwent  an  exponential  expansion  called  inflation <period> in  about  the  first  billionth  of  a  second  or  so <comma> the  higgs  field  kicked  in <comma> and  the  quarks  and  the  gluons  and  the  electrons  that  make  us  up  got  mass <period> the  universe  continued  to  expand  and  cool <period> after  about  a  few  minutes <comma> there  was  hydrogen  and  helium  in  the  universe <period> that  's  all <period> the  universe  was  about  75  percent  hydrogen <comma> 25  percent  helium <period> it  still  is  today <period> it  continued  to  expand  about  300  million  years <period> then  light  began  to  travel  through  the  universe <period> it  was  big  enough  to  be  transparent  to  light <comma> and  that  's  what  we  see  in  the  cosmic  microwave  background  that  george  smoot  described  as  looking  at  the  face  of  god <period> after  about  400  million  years <comma> the  first  stars  formed <comma> and  that  hydrogen <comma> that  helium <comma> then  began  to  cook  into  the  heavier  elements <period> so  the  elements  of  life <comma> carbon <comma> and  oxygen  and  iron <comma> all  the  elements  that  we  need  to  make  us  up <comma> were  cooked  in  those  first  generations  of  stars <comma> which  then  ran  out  of  fuel <comma> exploded <comma> threw  those  elements  back  into  the  universe <period> they  then  re-collapsed  into  another  generation  of  stars  and  planets <period> and  on  some  of  those  planets <comma> the  oxygen <comma> which  had  been  created  in  that  first  generation  of  stars <comma> could  fuse  with  hydrogen  to  form  water <comma> liquid  water  on  the  surface <period> on  at  least  one <comma> and  maybe  only  one  of  those  planets <comma> primitive  life  evolved <comma> which  evolved  over  millions  of  years  into  things  that  walked  upright  and  left  footprints  about  three  and  a  half  million  years  ago  in  the  mud  flats  of  tanzania <comma> and  eventually  left  a  footprint  on  another  world <period> and  built  this  civilization <comma> this  wonderful  picture <comma> that  turned  the  darkness  into  light <comma> and  you  can  see  the  civilization  from  space <period> as  one  of  my  great  heroes <comma> carl  sagan <comma> said <comma> these  are  the  things <comma> and  actually <comma> not  only  these <comma> but  i  was  looking  around <comma> these  are  the  things <comma> like  saturn  v  rockets <comma> and  sputnik <comma> and  dna <comma> and  literature  and  science <comma> these  are  the  things  that  hydrogen  atoms  do  when  given  137  billion  years <period> absolutely  remarkable <period> and <comma> the  laws  of  physics <period> right <questionmark> so <comma> the  right  laws  of  physics <comma> they  're  beautifully  balanced <period> if  the  weak  force  had  been  a  little  bit  different <comma> then  carbon  and  oxygen  would  n't  be  stable  inside  the  hearts  of  stars <comma> and  there  would  be  none  of  that  in  the  universe <period> and  i  think  that  's  a  wonderful  and  significant  story <period> 50  years  ago <comma> i  could  n't  have  told  that  story <comma> because  we  did  n't  know  it <period> it  makes  me  really  feel  that  that  civilization <comma> which <comma> as  i  say <comma> if  you  believe  the  scientific  creation  story <comma> has  emerged  purely  as  a  result  of  the  laws  of  physics <comma> and  a  few  hydrogen  atoms <comma> then  i  think <comma> to  me  anyway <comma> it  makes  me  feel  incredibly  valuable <period> so  that  's  the  lhc <period> the  lhc  is  certainly <comma> when  it  turns  on  in  summer <comma> going  to  write  the  next  chapter  of  that  book <period> and  i  'm  certainly  looking  forward  with  immense  excitement  to  it  being  turned  on <period> thanks <period> i  'm  here  today  representing  a  team  of  artists  and  technologists  and  filmmakers  that  worked  together  on  a  remarkable  film  project  for  the  last  four  years <period> and  along  the  way  they  created  a  breakthrough  in  computer  visualization <period> so  i  want  to  show  you  a  clip  of  the  film  now <period> hopefully  it  wo  n't  stutter <period> and  if  we  did  our  jobs  well <comma> you  wo  n't  know  that  we  were  even  involved <period> voice   <comma> i  do  n't  know  how  it  's  possible <period> but  you  seem  to  have  more  hair <period> brad  pitt <comma> what  if  i  told  you  that  i  was  n't  getting  older <period> but  i  was  getting  younger  than  everybody  else <questionmark> i  was  born  with  some  form  of  disease <period> voice <comma> what  kind  of  disease <questionmark> bp <comma> i  was  born  old <period> man <comma> i  'm  sorry <period> bp <comma> no  need  to  be <period> there  's  nothing  wrong  with  old  age <period> girl <comma> are  you  sick <questionmark> bp <comma> i  heard  momma  and  tizzy  whisper <comma> and  they  said  i  was  gonna  die  soon <period> but <period> maybe  not <period> girl <comma> you  're  different  than  anybody  i've  ever  met <period> bb <comma> there  were  many  changes <period> some  you  could  see <comma> some  you  could  n't <period> hair  started  growing  in  all  sorts  of  places <comma> along  with  other  things <period> i  felt  pretty  good <comma> considering <period> ed  ulbrich <comma> that  was  a  clip  from  the  curious  case  of  benjamin  button <period> many  of  you <comma> maybe  you've  seen  it  or  you've  heard  of  the  story <comma> but  what  you  might  not  know  is  that  for  nearly  the  first  hour  of  the  film <comma> the  main  character <comma> benjamin  button <comma> who  's  played  by  brad  pitt <comma> is  completely  computer-generated  from  the  neck  up <period> now <comma> there  's  no  use  of  prosthetic  makeup  or  photography  of  brad  superimposed  over  another  actor  's  body <period> we've  created  a  completely  digital  human  head <period> so  i'd  like  to  start  with  a  little  bit  of  history  on  the  project <period> this  is  based  on  an  f <period> scott  fitzgerald  short  story <period> it  's  about  a  man  who  's  born  old  and  lives  his  life  in  reverse <period> now <comma> this  movie  has  floated  around  hollywood  for  well  over  half  a  century <comma> and  we  first  got  involved  with  the  project  in  the  early  90s <comma> with  ron  howard  as  the  director <period> we  took  a  lot  of  meetings  and  we  seriously  considered  it <period> but  at  the  time  we  had  to  throw  in  the  towel <period> it  was  deemed  impossible <period> it  was  beyond  the  technology  of  the  day  to  depict  a  man  aging  backwards <period> the  human  form <comma> in  particular  the  human  head <comma> has  been  considered  the  holy  grail  of  our  industry <period> the  project  came  back  to  us  about  a  decade  later <comma> and  this  time  with  a  director  named  david  fincher <period> now <comma> fincher  is  an  interesting  guy <period> david  is  fearless  of  technology <comma> and  he  is  absolutely  tenacious <period> and  david  wo  n't  take  no <period> and  david  believed <comma> like  we  do  in  the  visual  effects  industry <comma> that  anything  is  possible  as  long  as  you  have  enough  time <comma> resources  and <comma> of  course <comma> money <period> and  so  david  had  an  interesting  take  on  the  film <comma> and  he  threw  a  challenge  at  us <period> he  wanted  the  main  character  of  the  film  to  be  played  from  the  cradle  to  the  grave  by  one  actor <period> it  happened  to  be  this  guy <period> we  went  through  a  process  of  elimination  and  a  process  of  discovery  with  david <comma> and  we  ruled  out <comma> of  course <comma> swapping  actors <period> that  was  one  idea <comma> that  we  would  have  different  actors <comma> and  we  would  hand  off  from  actor  to  actor <period> we  even  ruled  out  the  idea  of  using  makeup <period> we  realized  that  prosthetic  makeup  just  would  n't  hold  up <comma> particularly  in  close-up <period> and  makeup  is  an  additive  process <period> you  have  to  build  the  face  up <period> and  david  wanted  to  carve  deeply  into  brad  's  face  to  bring  the  aging  to  this  character <period> he  needed  to  be  a  very  sympathetic  character <period> so  we  decided  to  cast  a  series  of  little  people  that  would  play  the  different  bodies  of  benjamin  at  the  different  increments  of  his  life  and  that  we  would  in  fact  create  a  computer-generated  version  of  brad  's  head <comma> aged  to  appear  as  benjamin <comma> and  attach  that  to  the  body  of  the  real  actor <period> sounded  great <period> of  course <comma> this  was  the  holy  grail  of  our  industry <comma> and  the  fact  that  this  guy  is  a  global  icon  did  n't  help  either <comma> because  i  'm  sure  if  any  of  you  ever  stand  in  line  at  the  grocery  store <comma> you  know <comma> we  see  his  face  constantly <period> so  there  really  was  no  tolerable  margin  of  error <period> there  were  two  studios  involved <comma> warner  brothers  and  paramount <period> and  they  both  believed  this  would  make  an  amazing  film <comma> of  course <comma> but  it  was  a  very  high-risk  proposition <period> there  was  lots  of  money  and  reputations  at  stake <period> but  we  believed  that  we  had  a  very  solid  methodology  that  might  work <period> but  despite  our  verbal  assurances <comma> they  wanted  some  proof <period> and  so <comma> in  2004 <comma> they  commissioned  us  to  do  a  screen  test  of  benjamin <period> and  we  did  it  in  about  five  weeks <period> but  we  used  lots  of  cheats  and  shortcuts <period> we  basically  put  something  together  to  get  through  the  meeting <period> i  'll  roll  that  for  you  now <period> this  was  the  first  test  for  benjamin  button <period> and  in  here <comma> you  can  see <comma> that  's  a  computer-generated  head <comma> pretty  good <comma> attached  to  the  body  of  an  actor <period> and  it  worked <period> and  it  gave  the  studio  great  relief <period> after  many  years  of  starts  and  stops  on  this  project <comma> and  making  that  tough  decision <comma> they  finally  decided  to  greenlight  the  movie <period> and  i  can  remember <comma> actually <comma> when  i  got  the  phone  call  to  congratulate  us <comma> to  say  the  movie  was  a  go <comma> i  actually  threw  up <period> you  know <comma> this  is  some  tough  stuff <period> so  we  started  to  have  early  team  meetings <comma> and  we  got  everybody  together <comma> and  it  was  really  more  like  therapy  in  the  beginning <comma> convincing  each  other  and  reassuring  each  other  that  we  could  actually  undertake  this <period> we  had  to  hold  up  an  hour  of  a  movie  with  a  character <period> and  it  's  not  a  special  effects  film <period> it  has  to  be  a  man <period> we  really  felt  like  we  were  in  a <comma> kind  of  a  12-step  program <period> and  of  course <comma> the  first  step  is <comma> admit  you've  got  a  problem <period> so  we  had  a  big  problem: <period> we  did  n't  know  how  we  were  going  to  do  this <period> but  we  did  know  one  thing <period> being  from  the  visual  effects  industry <comma> we <comma> with  david <comma> believed  that  we  now  had  enough  time <comma> enough  resources <comma> and <comma> god <comma> we  hoped  we  had  enough  money <period> and  we  had  enough  passion  to  will  the  processes  and  technology  into  existence <period> so <comma> when  you  're  faced  with  something  like  that <comma> of  course  you've  got  to  break  it  down <period> you  take  the  big  problem  and  you  break  it  down  into  smaller  pieces  and  you  start  to  attack  that <period> so  we  had  three  main  areas  that  we  had  to  focus  on <period> we  needed  to  make  brad  look  a  lot  older  -- <period> needed  to  age  him  45  years  or  so <period> and  we  also  needed  to  make  sure  that  we  could  take  brad  's  idiosyncrasies <comma> his  little  tics <comma> the  little  subtleties  that  make  him  who  he  is  and  have  that  translate  through  our  process  so  that  it  appears  in  benjamin  on  the  screen <period> and  we  also  needed  to  create  a  character  that  could  hold  up  under <comma> really <comma> all  conditions <period> he  needed  to  be  able  to  walk  in  broad  daylight <comma> at  nighttime <comma> under  candlelight <comma> he  had  to  hold  an  extreme  close-up <comma> he  had  to  deliver  dialogue <period> he  had  to  be  able  to  take  a  bath <comma> to  cry <comma> he  even  had  to  throw  up <period> not  all  at  the  same  time <comma> but  he  had  to <comma> you  know <comma> do  all  of  those  things <period> and  the  work  had  to  hold  up  for  almost  the  first  hour  of  the  movie <period> we  did  about  325  shots <period> so  we  needed  a  system  that  would  allow  benjamin  to  do  everything  a  human  being  can  do <period> and  we  realized  that  there  was  a  giant  chasm  between  the  state  of  the  art  of  technology  in  2004  and  where  we  needed  it  to  be <period> so  we  focused  on  motion  capture <period> i  'm  sure  many  of  you  have  seen  motion  capture <period> the  state  of  the  art  at  the  time  was  something  called  marker-based  motion  capture <period> i  'll  give  you  an  example  here <period> it  's  basically  the  idea  of <comma> you  wear  a  leotard <comma> and  they  put  some  reflective  markers  on  your  body <comma> and  instead  of  using  cameras <comma> there  're  infrared  sensors  around  a  volume <comma> and  those  infrared  sensors  track  the  three-dimensional  position  of  those  markers  in  real  time <period> and  then  animators  can  take  the  data  of  the  motion  of  those  markers  and  apply  them  to  a  computer-generated  character <period> you  can  see  the  computer  characters  on  the  right  are  having  the  same  complex  motion  as  the  dancers <period> but  we  also  looked  at  numbers  of  other  films  at  the  time  that  were  using  facial  marker  tracking <comma> and  that  's  the  idea  of  putting  markers  on  the  human  face  and  doing  the  same  process <period> and  as  you  can  see <comma> it  gives  you  a  pretty  crappy  performance <period> that  's  not  terribly  compelling <period> and  what  we  realized  was  that  what  we  needed  was  the  information  that  was  going  on  between  the  markers <period> we  needed  the  subtleties  of  the  skin <period> we  needed  to  see  skin  moving  over  muscle  moving  over  bone <period> we  needed  creases  and  dimples  and  wrinkles  and  all  of  those  things <period> our  first  revelation  was  to  completely  abort  and  walk  away  from  the  technology  of  the  day <comma> the  status  quo <comma> the  state  of  the  art <period> so  we  aborted  using  motion  capture <period> and  we  were  now  well  out  of  our  comfort  zone <comma> and  in  uncharted  territory <period> so  we  were  left  with  this  idea  that  we  ended  up  calling  technology  stew <period> we  started  to  look  out  in  other  fields <period> the  idea  was  that  we  were  going  to  find  nuggets  or  gems  of  technology  that  come  from  other  industries  like  medical  imaging <comma> the  video  game  space <comma> and  re-appropriate  them <period> and  we  had  to  create  kind  of  a  sauce <period> and  the  sauce  was  code  in  software  that  we'd  written  to  allow  these  disparate  pieces  of  technology  to  come  together  and  work  as  one <period> initially <comma> we  came  across  some  remarkable  research  done  by  a  gentleman  named  dr.  paul  ekman  in  the  early  70s <period> he  believed  that  he  could <comma> in  fact <comma> catalog  the  human  face <period> and  he  came  up  with  this  idea  of  facial  action  coding  system <comma> or  facs <period> he  believed  that  there  were  70  basic  poses  or  shapes  of  the  human  face <comma> and  that  those  basic  poses  or  shapes  of  the  face  can  be  combined  to  create  infinite  possibilities  of  everything  the  human  face  is  capable  of  doing <period> and  of  course <comma> these  transcend  age <comma> race <comma> culture <comma> gender <period> so  this  became  the  foundation  of  our  research  as  we  went  forward <period> and  then  we  came  across  some  remarkable  technology  called  contour <period> and  here  you  can  see  a  subject  having  phosphorus  makeup  stippled  on  her  face <period> and  now  what  we  're  looking  at  is  really  creating  a  surface  capture  as  opposed  to  a  marker  capture <period> the  subject  stands  in  front  of  a  computer  array  of  cameras <comma> and  those  cameras  can <comma> frame-by-frame <comma> reconstruct  the  geometry  of  exactly  what  the  subject  's  doing  at  the  moment <period> so <comma> effectively <comma> you  get  3d  data  in  real  time  of  the  subject <period> and  if  you  look  in  a  comparison <comma> on  the  left <comma> we  see  what  volumetric  data  gives  us  and  on  the  right  you  see  what  markers  give  us <period> so <comma> clearly <comma> we  were  in  a  substantially  better  place  for  this <period> but  these  were  the  early  days  of  this  technology <comma> and  it  was  n't  really  proven  yet <period> we  measure  complexity  and  fidelity  of  data  in  terms  of  polygonal  count <period> and  so <comma> on  the  left <comma> we  were  seeing  100,000  polygons <period> we  could  go  up  into  the  millions  of  polygons <period> it  seemed  to  be  infinite <period> this  was  when  we  had  our  aha <period> this  was  the  breakthrough <period> this  is  when  we  're  like <comma> ok <comma> we  're  going  to  be  ok <comma> this  is  actually  going  to  work <period> and  the  aha  was <comma> what  if  we  could  take  brad  pitt <comma> and  we  could  put  brad  in  this  device <comma> and  use  this  contour  process <period> and  we  could  stipple  on  this  phosphorescent  makeup  and  put  him  under  the  black  lights <period> and  we  could <comma> in  fact <comma> scan  him  in  real  time  performing  ekman  's  facs  poses <period> right <questionmark> so <comma> effectively <comma> we  ended  up  with  a  3d  database  of  everything  brad  pitt  's  face  is  capable  of  doing <period> from  there <comma> we  actually  carved  up  those  faces  into  smaller  pieces  and  components  of  his  face <period> so  we  ended  up  with  literally  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  of  shapes <period> a  complete  database  of  all  possibilities  that  his  face  is  capable  of  doing <period> now <comma> that  's  great <comma> except  we  had  him  at  age  44 <period> we  need  to  put  another  40  years  on  him  at  this  point <period> we  brought  in  rick  baker <comma> and  rick  is  one  of  the  great  makeup  and  special  effects  gurus  of  our  industry <period> and  we  also  brought  in  a  gentleman  named  kazu  tsuji <comma> and  kazu  tsuji  is  one  of  the  great  photorealist  sculptors  of  our  time <period> and  we  commissioned  them  to  make  a  maquette <comma> or  a  bust <comma> of  benjamin <period> so <comma> in  the  spirit  of  the  great  unveiling <comma> i  had  to  do  this <comma> i  had  to  unveil  something <period> so  this  is  ben  80 <period> we  created  three  of  these <comma> there  's  ben  80 <comma> there  's  ben  70 <comma> there  's  ben  60 <period> and  this  really  became  the  template  for  moving  forward <period> now <comma> this  was  made  from  a  life  cast  of  brad <period> so <comma> in  fact <comma> anatomically <comma> it  is  correct <period> the  eyes <comma> the  jaw <comma> the  teeth: <period> everything  is  in  perfect  alignment  with  what  the  real  guy  has <period> we  have  these  maquettes  scanned  into  the  computer  at  very  high  resolution  -- <period> enormous  polygonal  count <period> and  so  now  we  had  three  age  increments  of  benjamin  in  the  computer <period> but  we  needed  to  get  a  database  of  him  doing  more  than  that <period> we  went  through  this  process <comma> then <comma> called  retargeting <period> this  is  brad  doing  one  of  the  ekman  facs  poses <period> and  here  's  the  resulting  data  that  comes  from  that <comma> the  model  that  comes  from  that <period> retargeting  is  the  process  of  transposing  that  data  onto  another  model <period> and  because  the  life  cast <comma> or  the  bust <comma> the  maquette <comma> of  benjamin  was  made  from  brad <comma> we  could  transpose  the  data  of  brad  at  44  onto  brad  at  87 <period> so  now <comma> we  had  a  3d  database  of  everything  brad  pitt  's  face  can  do  at  age  87 <comma> in  his  70s  and  in  his  60s <period> next  we  had  to  go  into  the  shooting  process <period> so  while  all  that  's  going  on <comma> we  're  down  in  new  orleans  and  locations  around  the  world <period> and  we  shot  our  body  actors <comma> and  we  shot  them  wearing  blue  hoods <period> so  these  are  the  gentleman  who  played  benjamin <period> and  the  blue  hoods  helped  us  with  two  things <comma> one <comma> we  could  easily  erase  their  heads <period> and  we  also  put  tracking  markers  on  their  heads  so  we  could  recreate  the  camera  motion  and  the  lens  optics  from  the  set <period> but  now  we  needed  to  get  brad  's  performance  to  drive  our  virtual  benjamin <period> and  so  we  edited  the  footage  that  was  shot  on  location  with  the  rest  of  the  cast  and  the  body  actors  and  about  six  months  later  we  brought  brad  onto  a  sound  stage  in  los  angeles  and  he  watched  on  the  screen <period> his  job <comma> then <comma> was  to  become  benjamin <period> and  so  we  looped  the  scenes <period> he  watched  again  and  again <period> we  encouraged  him  to  improvise <period> and  he  took  benjamin  into  interesting  and  unusual  places  that  we  did  n't  think  he  was  going  to  go <period> we  shot  him  with  four  hd  cameras  so  we'd  get  multiple  views  of  him  and  then  david  would  choose  the  take  of  brad  being  benjamin  that  he  thought  best  matched  the  footage  with  the  rest  of  the  cast <period> from  there  we  went  into  a  process  called  image  analysis <period> and  so  here <comma> you  can  see  again <comma> the  chosen  take <period> and  you  are  seeing <comma> now <comma> that  data  being  transposed  on  to  ben  87 <period> and  so <comma> what  's  interesting  about  this  is  we  used  something  called  image  analysis <comma> which  is  taking  timings  from  different  components  of  benjamin  's  face <period> and  so  we  could  choose <comma> say <comma> his  left  eyebrow <period> and  the  software  would  tell  us  that <comma> well <comma> in  frame  14  the  left  eyebrow  begins  to  move  from  here  to  here <comma> and  it  concludes  moving  in  frame  32 <period> and  so  we  could  choose  numbers  of  positions  on  the  face  to  pull  that  data  from <period> and  then <comma> the  sauce  i  talked  about  with  our  technology  stew <comma> that  secret  sauce  was <comma> effectively <comma> software  that  allowed  us  to  match  the  performance  footage  of  brad  in  live  action  with  our  database  of  aged  benjamin <comma> the  facs  shapes  that  we  had <period> on  a  frame-by-frame  basis <comma> we  could  actually  reconstruct  a  3d  head  that  exactly  matched  the  performance  of  brad <period> so  this  was  how  the  finished  shot  appeared  in  the  film <period> and  here  you  can  see  the  body  actor <period> and  then  this  is  what  we  called  the  dead  head <comma> no  reference  to  jerry  garcia <period> and  then  here  's  the  reconstructed  performance  now  with  the  timings  of  the  performance <period> and  then <comma> again <comma> the  final  shot <period> it  was  a  long  process <period> the  next  section  here <comma> i  'm  going  to  just  blast  through  this <comma> because  we  could  do  a  whole  tedtalk  on  the  next  several  slides <period> we  had  to  create  a  lighting  system <period> so  really <comma> a  big  part  of  our  processes  was  creating  a  lighting  environment  for  every  single  location  that  benjamin  had  to  appear  so  that  we  could  put  ben  's  head  into  any  scene  and  it  would  exactly  match  the  lighting  that  's  on  the  other  actors  in  the  real  world <period> we  also  had  to  create  an  eye  system <period> we  found  the  old  adage <comma> you  know <comma> the  eyes  are  the  window  to  the  soul <comma> absolutely  true <period> so  the  key  here  was  to  keep  everybody  looking  in  ben  's  eyes <period> and  if  you  could  feel  the  warmth <comma> and  feel  the  humanity <comma> and  feel  his  intent  coming  through  the  eyes <comma> then  we  would  succeed <period> so  we  had  one  person  focused  on  the  eye  system  for  almost  two  full  years <period> we  also  had  to  create  a  mouth  system <period> we  worked  from  dental  molds  of  brad <period> we  had  to  age  the  teeth  over  time <period> we  also  had  to  create  an  articulating  tongue  that  allowed  him  to  enunciate  his  words <period> there  was  a  whole  system  written  in  software  to  articulate  the  tongue <period> we  had  one  person  devoted  to  the  tongue  for  about  nine  months <period> he  was  very  popular <period> skin  displacement <comma> another  big  deal <period> the  skin  had  to  be  absolutely  accurate <period> he  's  also  in  an  old  age  home <comma> he  's  in  a  nursing  home  around  other  old  people <comma> so  he  had  to  look  exactly  the  same  as  the  others <period> so <comma> lots  of  work  on  skin  deformation <comma> you  can  see  in  some  of  these  cases  it  works <comma> in  some  cases  it  looks  bad <period> this  is  a  very <comma> very <comma> very  early  test  in  our  process <period> so <comma> effectively  we  created  a  digital  puppet  that  brad  pitt  could  operate  with  his  own  face <period> there  were  no  animators  necessary  to  come  in  and  interpret  behavior  or  enhance  his  performance <period> there  was  something  that  we  encountered <comma> though <comma> that  we  ended  up  calling  the  digital  botox  effect <period> so <comma> as  things  went  through  this  process <comma> fincher  would  always  say <comma> it  sandblasts  the  edges  off  of  the  performance <period> and  thing  our  process  and  the  technology  could  n't  do <comma> is  they  could  n't  understand  intent <comma> the  intent  of  the  actor <period> so  it  sees  a  smile  as  a  smile <period> it  does  n't  recognize  an  ironic  smile <comma> or  a  happy  smile <comma> or  a  frustrated  smile <period> so  it  did  take  humans  to  kind  of  push  it  one  way  or  another <period> but  we  ended  up  calling  the  entire  process  and  all  the  technology  emotion  capture <comma> as  opposed  to  just  motion  capture <period> take  another  look <period> brad  pitt <comma> well <comma> i  heard  momma  and  tizzy  whisper <comma> and  they  said  i  was  gonna  die  soon <period> but <period> maybe  not <period> eu <comma> that  's  how  to  create  a  digital  human  in  18  minutes <period> a  couple  of  quick  factoids <period> it  really  took  155  people  over  two  years <comma> and  we  did  n't  even  talk  about  60  hairstyles  and  an  all-digital  haircut <period> but <comma> that  is  benjamin <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> and  i  feel  like  this  whole  evening  has  been  very  amazing  to  me <period> i  feel  it  's  sort  of  like  the  vimalakirti  sutra <comma> an  ancient  work  from  ancient  india  in  which  the  buddha  appears  at  the  beginning  and  a  whole  bunch  of  people  come  to  see  him  from  the  biggest  city  in  the  area <comma> vaishali <comma> and  they  bring  some  sort  of  jeweled  parasols  to  make  an  offering  to  him <period> all  the  young  people <comma> actually <comma> from  the  city <period> the  old  fogeys  do  n't  come  because  they  're  mad  at  buddha <comma> because  when  he  came  to  their  city  he  accepted <comma> he  always  accepts  the  first  invitation  that  comes  to  him <comma> from  whoever  it  is <comma> and  the  local  geisha <comma> a  movie-star  sort  of  person <comma> raced  the  elders  of  the  city  in  a  chariot  and  invited  him  first <period> so  he  was  hanging  out  with  the  movie  star <comma> and  of  course  they  were  grumbling <comma> he  's  supposed  to  be  religious  and  all  this <period> what  's  he  doing  over  there  at  amrapali  's  house  with  all  his  500  monks <comma> and  so  on <period> they  were  all  grumbling <comma> and  so  they  boycotted  him <period> they  would  n't  go  listen  to  him <period> but  the  young  people  all  came <period> and  they  brought  this  kind  of  a  jeweled  parasol <comma> and  they  put  it  on  the  ground <period> and  as  soon  as  they  had  laid  all  these <comma> all  their  big  stack  of  these  jeweled  parasols  that  they  used  to  carry  in  ancient  india <comma> he  performed  a  kind  of  special  effect  which  made  it  into  a  giant  planetarium <comma> the  wonder  of  the  universe <period> everyone  looked  in  that <comma> and  they  saw  in  there  the  total  interconnectedness  of  all  life  in  all  universes <period> and  of  course <comma> in  the  buddhist  cosmos  there  are  millions  and  billions  of  planets  with  human  life  on  it <comma> and  enlightened  beings  can  see  the  life  on  all  the  other  planets <period> so  they  do  n't <comma> when  they  look  out  and  they  see  those  lights  that  you  showed  in  the  sky <comma> they  do  n't  just  see  sort  of  pieces  of  matter  burning  or  rocks  or  flames  or  gases  exploding <period> they  actually  see  landscapes  and  human  beings  and  gods  and  dragons  and  serpent  beings  and  goddesses  and  things  like  that <period> he  made  that  special  effect  at  the  beginning  to  get  everyone  to  think  about  interconnection  and  interconnectedness  and  how  everything  in  life  was  totally  interconnected <period> and  then  leilei <comma> i  know  his  other  name <comma> told  us  about  interconnection <comma> and  how  we  're  all  totally  interconnected  here <comma> and  how  we've  all  known  each  other <period> and  of  course  in  the  buddhist  universe <comma> we've  already  done  this  already  billions  of  times  in  many <comma> many  lifetimes  in  the  past <period> and  i  did  n't  give  the  talk  always <period> you  did <comma> and  we  had  to  watch  you <comma> and  so  forth <period> and  we  're  all  still  trying  to <comma> i  guess  we  're  all  trying  to  become  tedsters <comma> if  that  's  a  modern  form  of  enlightenment <period> i  guess  so <period> because  in  a  way <comma> if  a  tedster  relates  to  all  the  interconnectedness  of  all  the  computers  and  everything <comma> it  's  the  forging  of  a  mass  awareness <comma> of  where  everybody  can  really  know  everything  that  's  going  on  everywhere  in  the  planet <period> and  therefore  it  will  become  intolerable <comma> what  compassion  is <comma> is  where  it  will  become  intolerable  for  us <comma> totally  intolerable  that  we  sit  here  in  comfort  and  in  pleasure  and  enjoying  the  life  of  the  mind  or  whatever  it  is <comma> and  there  are  people  who  are  absolutely  riddled  with  disease  and  they  cannot  have  a  bite  of  food  and  they  have  no  place <comma> or  they  're  being  brutalized  by  some  terrible  person  and  so  forth <period> it  just  becomes  intolerable <period> with  all  of  us  knowing  everything <comma> we  're  kind  of  forced  by  technology  to  become  buddhas  or  something <comma> to  become  enlightened <period> and  of  course <comma> we  all  will  be  deeply  disappointed  when  we  do <period> because  we  think  that  because  we  are  kind  of  tired  of  what  we  do <comma> a  little  bit  tired <comma> we  do  suffer <period> we  do  enjoy  our  misery  in  a  certain  way <period> we  distract  ourselves  from  our  misery  by  running  around  somewhere <comma> but  basically  we  all  have  this  common  misery  that  we  are  sort  of  stuck  inside  our  skins  and  everyone  else  is  out  there <period> and  occasionally  we  get  together  with  another  person  stuck  in  their  skin  and  the  two  of  us  enjoy  each  other <comma> and  each  one  tries  to  get  out  of  their  own <comma> and  ultimately  it  fails  of  course <comma> and  then  we  're  back  into  this  thing <period> because  our  egocentric  perception <comma> from  the  buddha  's  point  of  view <comma> misperception <comma> is  that  all  we  are  is  what  is  inside  our  skin <period> and  it  's  inside  and  outside <comma> self  and  other <comma> and  other  is  all  very  different <period> and  everyone  here  is  unfortunately  carrying  that  habitual  perception <comma> a  little  bit <comma> right <questionmark> you  know <comma> someone  sitting  next  to  you  in  a  seat <comma> that  's  ok  because  you  're  in  a  theater <comma> but  if  you  were  sitting  on  a  park  bench  and  someone  came  up  and  sat  that  close  to  you <comma> you'd  freak  out <period> what  do  they  want  from  me <questionmark> like <comma> who  's  that <questionmark> and  so  you  would  n't  sit  that  close  to  another  person  because  of  your  notion  that  it  's  you  versus  the  universe <comma> that  's  all  buddha  discovered <period> because  that  cosmic  basic  idea  that  it  is  us  all  alone <comma> each  of  us <comma> and  everyone  else  is  different <comma> then  that  puts  us  in  an  impossible  situation <comma> does  n't  it <questionmark> who  is  it  who  's  going  to  get  enough  attention  from  the  world <questionmark> who  's  going  to  get  enough  out  of  the  world <questionmark> who  's  not  going  to  be  overrun  by  an  infinite  number  of  other  beings <comma> if  you  're  different  from  all  the  other  beings <questionmark> so  where  compassion  comes  is  where  you  surprisingly  discover  you  lose  yourself  in  some  way <comma> through  art <comma> through  meditation <comma> through  understanding <comma> through  knowledge  actually <comma> knowing  that  you  have  no  such  boundary <comma> knowing  your  interconnectedness  with  other  beings <period> you  can  experience  yourself  as  the  other  beings  when  you  see  through  the  delusion  of  being  separated  from  them <period> when  you  do  that <comma> you  're  forced  to  feel  what  they  feel <period> luckily <comma> they  say <comma> i  still  am  not  sure <comma> but  luckily <comma> they  say  that  when  you  reach  that  point  because  some  people  have  said  in  the  buddhist  literature <comma> they  say <comma> oh  who  would  really  want  to  be  compassionate <questionmark> how  awful <period> i  'm  so  miserable  on  my  own <period> my  head  is  aching <period> my  bones  are  aching <period> i  go  from  birth  to  death <period> i  'm  never  satisfied <period> i  never  have  enough <comma> even  if  i  'm  a  billionaire <comma> i  do  n't  have  enough <period> i  need  a  hundred  billion  so  i  'm  like  that <period> imagine  if  i  had  to  feel  even  a  hundred  other  people  's  suffering <period> it  would  be  terrible <period> but  apparently <comma> this  is  a  strange  paradox  of  life <period> when  you  're  no  longer  locked  in  yourself <comma> and  as  the  wisdom  or  the  intelligence  or  the  scientific  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  the  world <comma> that  enables  you  to  let  your  mind  spread  out <comma> and  empathize <comma> and  enhance  the  basic  human  ability  of  empathizing <comma> and  realizing  that  you  are  the  other  being <comma> somehow  by  that  opening <comma> you  can  see  the  deeper  nature  of  life <period> and  you  can <comma> you  get  away  from  this  terrible  iron  circle  of  i <comma> me <comma> me <comma> mine <comma> like  the  beatles  used  to  sing <period> you  know <comma> we  really  learned  everything  in  the  60s <period> too  bad  nobody  ever  woke  up  to  it <comma> and  they've  been  trying  to  suppress  it  since  then <period> i <comma> me <comma> me <comma> mine <period> it  's  like  a  perfect  song <comma> that  song <period> a  perfect  teaching <period> but  when  we  're  relieved  from  that <comma> we  somehow  then  become  interested  in  all  the  other  beings <period> and  we  feel  ourselves  differently <period> it  's  totally  strange <period> it  's  totally  strange <period> the  dalai  lama  always  likes  to  say <comma> he  says  that  when  you  give  birth  in  your  mind  to  the  idea  of  compassion <comma> it  's  because  you  realize  that  you  yourself  and  your  pains  and  pleasures  are  finally  too  small  a  theater  for  your  intelligence <period> it  's  really  too  boring  whether  you  feel  like  this  or  like  that <comma> or  what <comma> you  know <comma> and  the  more  you  focus  on  how  you  feel <comma> by  the  way <comma> the  worse  it  gets <period> like <comma> even  when  you  're  having  a  good  time <comma> when  is  the  good  time  over <questionmark> the  good  time  is  over  when  you  think <comma> how  good  is  it <questionmark> and  then  it  's  never  good  enough <period> i  love  that  leilei  said  that  the  way  of  helping  those  who  are  suffering  badly  on  the  physical  plane  or  on  other  planes  is  having  a  good  time <comma> doing  it  by  having  a  good  time <period> i  think  the  dalai  lama  should  have  heard  that <period> i  wish  he'd  been  there  to  hear  that <period> he  once  told  me <comma> he  looked  kind  of  sad <period> he  worries  very  much  about  the  haves  and  have-nots <period> he  looked  a  little  sad <comma> because  he  said <comma> well <comma> a  hundred  years  ago <comma> they  went  and  took  everything  away  from  the  haves <period> you  know <comma> the  big  communist  revolutions <comma> russia  and  china  and  so  forth <period> they  took  it  all  away  by  violence <comma> saying  they  were  going  to  give  it  to  everyone <comma> and  then  they  were  even  worse <period> they  did  n't  help  at  all <period> so  what  could  possibly  change  this  terrible  gap  that  has  opened  up  in  the  world  today <questionmark> and  so  then  he  looks  at  me <period> so  i  said <comma> well <comma> you  know <comma> you  're  all  in  this  yourself <period> you  teach <comma> it  's  generosity <comma> was  all  i  could  think  of <period> what  is  virtue <questionmark> but  of  course <comma> what  you  said <comma> i  think  the  key  to  saving  the  world <comma> the  key  to  compassion  is  that  it  is  more  fun <period> it  should  be  done  by  fun <period> generosity  is  more  fun <period> that  's  the  key <period> everybody  has  the  wrong  idea <period> they  think  buddha  was  so  boring <comma> and  they  're  so  surprised  when  they  meet  dalai  lama  and  he  's  fairly  jolly <period> even  though  his  people  are  being  genocided <comma> and  believe  me <comma> he  feels  every  blow  on  every  old  nun  's  head <comma> in  every  chinese  prison <period> he  feels  it <period> he  feels  the  way  they  are  harvesting  yaks  nowadays <period> i  wo  n't  even  say  what  they  do <period> but  he  feels  it <period> and  yet  he  's  very  jolly <period> he  's  extremely  jolly <period> because  when  you  open  up  like  that <comma> then  you  cannot  just <comma> what  good  does  it  do  to  add  being  miserable  with  others  misery <questionmark> you  have  to  find  some  vision  where  you  see  how  hopeful  it  is <comma> how  it  can  be  changed <period> look  at  that  beautiful  thing  chiho  showed  us <period> she  scared  us  with  the  lava  man <period> she  scared  us  with  the  lava  man  is  coming <comma> then  the  tsunami  is  coming <comma> but  then  finally  there  were  flowers  and  trees <comma> and  it  was  very  beautiful <period> it  's  really  lovely <period> so <comma> compassion  means  to  feel  the  feelings  of  others <comma> and  the  human  being  actually  is  compassion <period> the  human  being  is  almost  out  of  time <period> the  human  being  is  compassion  because  what  is  our  brain  for <questionmark> now <comma> jim  's  brain  is  memorizing  the  almanac <period> but  he  could  memorize  all  the  needs  of  all  the  beings  that  he  is <comma> he  will <comma> he  did <period> he  could  memorize  all  kinds  of  fantastic  things  to  help  many  beings <period> and  he  would  have  tremendous  fun  doing  that <period> so  the  first  person  who  gets  happy <comma> when  you  stop  focusing  on  the  self-centered  situation  of <comma> how  happy  am  i <comma> where  you  're  always  dissatisfied <comma> as  mick  jagger  told  us <period> you  never  get  any  satisfaction  that  way <period> so  then  you  decide <comma> well <comma> i  'm  sick  of  myself <period> i  'm  going  to  think  of  how  other  people  can  be  happy <period> i  'm  going  to  get  up  in  the  morning  and  think <comma> what  can  i  do  for  even  one  other  person <comma> even  a  dog <comma> my  dog <comma> my  cat <comma> my  pet <comma> my  butterfly <questionmark> and  the  first  person  who  gets  happy  when  you  do  that <comma> you  do  n't  do  anything  for  anybody  else <comma> but  you  get  happier <comma> you  yourself <comma> because  your  whole  perception  broadens  and  you  suddenly  see  the  whole  world  and  all  of  the  people  in  it <period> and  you  realize  that  this <comma> being  with  these  people <comma> is  the  flower  garden  that  chiho  showed  us <period> it  is  nirvana <period> and  my  time  is  up <period> and  i  know  the  ted  commandments <period> thank  you <period> i  started  juggling  a  long  time  ago <comma> but  long  before  that <comma> i  was  a  golfer <comma> and  that  's  what  i  was <comma> a  golfer <period> and  as  a  golfer  and  as  a  kid <comma> one  of  the  things  that  really  sort  of  seeped  into  my  pores <comma> that  i  sort  of  lived  my  whole  life <comma> is  process <period> and  it  's  the  process  of  learning  things <period> one  of  the  great  things  was  that  my  father  was  an  avid  golfer <comma> but  he  was  lefty <period> and  he  had  a  real  passion  for  golf <comma> and  he  also  created  this  whole  mythology  about  ben  hogan  and  various  things <period> well <comma> i  learned  a  lot  about  interesting  things  that  i  knew  nothing  about  at  the  time <comma> but  grew  to  know  stuff  about <period> and  that  was  the  mythology  of  skill <period> so <comma> one  of  the  things  that  i  love  to  do  is  to  explore  skill <period> and  since  richard  put  me  on  this  whole  thing  with  music <comma> i  'm  supposed  to  actually  be  doing  a  project  with  tod  machover  with  the  mit  media  lab <comma> it  relates  a  lot  to  music <period> but  tod  could  n't  come  and  the  project  is  sort  of  somewhere <comma> i  'm  not  sure  whether  it  's  happening  the  way  we  thought <comma> or  not <period> but  i  'm  going  to  explore  skill <comma> and  juggling <comma> and  basically  visual  music <comma> i  guess <period> ok <comma> you  can  start  the  music <comma> thanks <period> thanks <period> thank  you <period> now <comma> juggling  can  be  a  lot  of  fun <period> play  with  skill  and  play  with  space <comma> play  with  rhythm <period> and  you  can  turn  the  mike  on  now <period> i  'm  going  to  do  a  couple  of  pieces <period> i  do  a  big  piece  in  a  triangle  and  these  are  three  sections  from  it <period> part  of  the  challenge  was  to  try  to  understand  rhythm  and  space  using  not  just  my  hands <comma> because  a  lot  of  juggling  is  hand-oriented <comma> but  using  the  rhythm  of  my  body  and  feet <comma> and  controlling  the  balls  with  my  feet <period> thanks <period> now <comma> this  next  section  was  an  attempt  to  explore  space <period> you  see <comma> i  think  richard  said  something  about  people  that  are  against  something <period> well <comma> a  lot  of  people  think  jugglers  defy  gravity  or  do  stuff <period> well <comma> i  kind  of <comma> from  my  childhood  and  golf  and  all  that <comma> it  's  a  process  of  joining  with  forces <period> and  so  what  i'd  like  to  do  is  try  to  figure  out  how  to  join  with  the  space  through  the  technique <period> so  juggling  gravity <comma> up <comma> down <period> if  you  figure  out  what  up  and  down  really  are <comma> it  's  a  complex  physical  set  of  skills  to  be  able  to  throw  a  ball  down  and  up  and  everything <comma> but  then  you  add  in  sideways <period> now <comma> i  look  at  it  somewhat  as  a  way <comma> when  you  learn  juggling  what  you  learn  is  how  to  feel  with  your  eyes <comma> and  see  with  your  hands  because  you  're  not  looking  at  your  hands <comma> you  're  looking  at  where  the  balls  are  or  you  're  looking  at  the  audience <period> so  this  next  part  is  really  a  way  of  understanding  space  and  rhythm <comma> with  the  obvious  reference  to  the  feet <period> but  it  's  also  time <comma> where  the  feet  were <comma> where  the  balls  were <period> thanks <period> so <comma> visual  music <comma> rhythm  and  complexity <period> i  'm  going  to  build  towards  complexity  now <period> juggling  three  balls  is  simple  and  normal <period> excuse  me <period> we  're  jugglers <comma> ok <period> and  remember <comma> you  're  transposing <comma> you  're  getting  into  a  subculture  here <period> and  juggling <comma> the  balls  cross  and  all  that <period> ok <comma> if  you  keep  them  in  their  assigned  paths  you  get  parallel  lines  of  different  heights <comma> but  then  hopefully  even  rhythm <period> and  you  can  change  the  rhythm <comma> good <comma> michael <period> you  can  change  the  rhythm <comma> if  you  get  out  of  the  lights <period> ok <questionmark> change  the  rhythm <comma> so  it  's  even <period> or  you  can  go  back  and  change  the  height <period> now <comma> skill <period> but  you  're  boxed  in <comma> if  you  can  only  do  it  up  and  down  that  way <period> so <comma> you've  got  to  go  after  the  space  down  there <period> ok <comma> then  you've  got  to  combine  them <comma> because  then  you  have  the  whole  spatial  palette  in  front  of  you <period> and  then  you  get  crazy <period> now <comma> i  'm  actually  going  to  ask  you  to  try  something <comma> so  you've  got  to  pay  attention <period> complexity: <period> if  you  spend  enough  time  doing  something <comma> time  slows  down  or  your  skill  increases <comma> so  your  perceptions  change <period> it  's  learning  skills <comma> like  being  in  a  high-speed  car  crash <period> things  slow  down  as  you  learn <comma> as  you  learn <comma> as  you  learn <period> you  may  not  be  able  to  affect  it <comma> it  almost  drifts  on  you <period> it  goes <period> but  that  's  the  closest  approximation  i  can  have  to  it <period> so <comma> complexity <period> now <comma> how  many  here  are  jugglers <questionmark> ok <comma> so  most  of  you  are  going  to  have  a  similar  reaction  to  this <period> ok <questionmark> and  whoever  laughed  there <comma> you  understood  it  completely <comma> right <questionmark> no <comma> it  looks  like  a  mess <period> it  looks  like  a  mess  with  a  guy  there <comma> who  's  got  his  hands  around  that  mess <comma> ok <period> well <comma> that  's  what  juggling  is  about <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  being  able  to  do  something  that  other  people  cannot  do  or  cannot  understand <period> all  right <period> so <comma> that  's  one  way  of  doing  it <comma> which  is  five  balls  down <period> ok <questionmark> another  way  is  the  outside <period> and  you  could  play  with  the  rhythm <period> same  pattern <period> make  it  faster  and  smaller <period> make  it  wider <period> make  it  narrower <period> bring  it  back  up <period> ok <period> it  's  done <period> thanks <period> now <comma> what  i  wanted  to  get  to  is  that  you  're  all  very  bright <comma> very  tactile <period> i  have  no  idea  how  computer-oriented  or  three-dimensionally-oriented  you  are <comma> but  let  's  try  something <period> ok <comma> so  since  you  all  do  n't  understand  what  the  five-ball  pattern  is <comma> i  'm  going  to  give  you  a  little  clue <period> enough  of  a  clue <questionmark> so <comma> you  get  the  pattern <comma> right <questionmark> ok <period> you  're  not  getting  off  that  easy <period> all  right <questionmark> now <comma> do  me  a  favor <comma> follow  the  ball  that  i  ask  you  to  follow <period> green <period> yellow <period> pink <period> white <period> ok <comma> you  can  do  that <questionmark> yeah <questionmark> ok <period> now <comma> let  's  actually  learn  something <period> actually <comma> let  me  put  you  in  that  area  of  learning <comma> which  is  very  insecure <period> you  want  to  do  it <questionmark> yeah <questionmark> ok <period> hands  out  in  front  of  you <period> palms  up <comma> together <period> what  you  're  going  to  learn  is  this <period> ok <questionmark> so  what  i  want  you  to  do  is  just  listen  to  me  and  do  it <period> index  finger <comma> middle  finger <comma> ring <comma> little <period> little <comma> ring <comma> middle <comma> index <period> and  then  open <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> a  little  bit  faster <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> all  right <period> a  lot  of  different  learning  processes  going  on  in  here <period> one  learning  process  that  i  see  is  this <comma> ok <period> another  learning  process  that  i  see  is  this <comma> ok <period> so <comma> everybody  take  a  deep  breath  in <comma> breath  out <period> ok <period> now <comma> one  more  time <comma> and <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> open <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> ok <period> shake  your  hands  out <period> now <comma> i  assume  a  lot  of  you  spend  a  lot  of  time  at  a  computer <period> ok <questionmark> so <comma> what  you  're  doing  is <comma> you  're  going  la <comma> la <comma> la <comma> and  you  're  getting  this <period> ok <questionmark> so  that  's  exactly  what  i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  do <comma> but  in  a  slightly  different  way <period> you  're  going  to  combine  it <period> so  what  i  want  you  to  do  is <comma> fingers <period> i  'll  tell  you  what  to  do  with  your  fingers <comma> same  thing <period> but  i  want  you  to  do  is  also <comma> with  your  eyes <comma> is  follow  the  colored  ball  that  i  ask  you  to  follow <period> ok <questionmark> here  we  go <period> so <comma> we  're  going  to  start  off  looking  at  the  white  ball <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  which  color <comma> and  i  'm  also  going  to  tell  you  to  go  with  your  fingers <period> ok <questionmark> so  white  ball  and <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> pink <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> green <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> yellow <period> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> pink  or  finger <period> pink <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <comma> finger <period> all  right <period> how  did  you  do <questionmark> well <questionmark> ok <period> the  reason  i  wanted  you  to  do  this  is  because  that  's  actually  what  most  people  face  throughout  their  lives <comma> a  moment  of  learning <comma> a  moment  of  challenge <period> it  's  a  moment  that  you  cannot  make  sense  of <period> why  the  hell  should  i  learn  this <questionmark> ok <questionmark> does  it  really  have  anything  to  do  with  anything  in  my  life <questionmark> you  know <comma> i  cannot  decipher <comma> is  it  fun <questionmark> is  it  challenging <questionmark> am  i  supposed  to  cheat <questionmark> you  know <comma> what  are  you  supposed  to  do <questionmark> you've  got  somebody  up  here  who  is  the  operative  principle  of  doing  that  for  his  whole  life <period> ok <questionmark> trying  to  figure  that  stuff  out <period> but  is  it  going  to  get  you  anywhere <questionmark> it  's  just  a  moment <period> that  's  all  it  is <comma> a  moment <period> ok <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  change  the  script  for  one  second <period> just  let  me  do  this <period> i  do  n't  need  music  for  it <period> talking  about  time  in  a  moment <period> there  's  a  piece  that  i  recently  developed  which  was  all  about  that <comma> a  moment <period> and  what  i  do  as  a  creative  artist  is  i  develop  vocabularies  or  languages  of  moving  objects <period> what  i've  done  for  you  here <comma> i  developed  a  lot  of  those  tricks  and  i  put  the  choreography  together <comma> but  they  're  not  original  techniques <period> now <comma> i  'm  going  to  start  showing  you  some  original  techniques  that  come  from  the  work  that  i've  developed <period> ok <questionmark> so <comma> a  moment <comma> how  would  you  define  a  moment <questionmark> well <comma> as  a  juggler <comma> what  i  wanted  to  do  was  create  something  that  was  representational  of  a  moment <period> ahhh <period> all  right <comma> i  'm  going  to  get  on  my  knees  and  do  it <period> so <comma> a  moment <period> ok <questionmark> and  then <comma> what  i  did  as  a  juggler  was  say <comma> ok <comma> what  can  i  do  to  make  that  something  that  is  dependent  on  something  else <comma> another  dynamic <period> so <comma> a  moment <period> another  moment <period> excuse  me <comma> still  getting  there <period> a  moment  that  travels <period> a  moment <comma> no <comma> we  'll  try  that  again <period> it  separates <comma> and  comes  back  together <period> time <period> how  can  you  look  at  time <questionmark> and  what  do  you  dedicate  it  to <comma> in  exploring  a  particular  thing <questionmark> well <comma> obviously <comma> there  's  something  in  here <comma> and  you  can  all  have  a  guess  as  to  what  it  is <period> there  's  a  mystery <period> there  's  a  mystery  in  the  moment <period> and  it  has  to  settle <period> and  then  it  's  dependent  on  something  else <period> and  then  it  comes  to  rest <period> just  a  little  thing  about  time <period> now <comma> this  has  expanded  into  a  much  bigger  piece <period> because  i  use  ramps  of  different  parabolas  that  i  roll  the  balls  on  while  i  'm  keeping  time  with  this <period> but  i  just  thought  i'd  talk  about  a  moment <period> all  right <period> ok <period> can  we  show  the  video  of  the  triangle <questionmark> are  we  ready  to  do  that <questionmark> yes <questionmark> this  is  the  piece  that  i  told  you  about <period> it  's  a  much  bigger  piece  that  i  do  exploring  the  space  of  a  geometric  triangle <period> thanks <period> the  only  thing  i  'll  say  about  the  last  session  is <comma> you  ever  try  juggling  and  driving  the  car  with  your  knees  at  120  miles  an  hour <questionmark> the  only  other  thing  is <comma> it  was  a  real  shock <period> i  always  drove  motorcycles <period> and  when  i  bought  my  first  car <comma> it  shocked  me  that  it  cost  three  times  more  than  my  parents  house <period> interesting <period> anyway <comma> balance <comma> constant  movement  to  find  an  approach  to  stillness <period> cheating <period> balance <comma> making  up  the  rules  so  you  cannot  cheat <comma> so  you  learn  to  approach  stillness  with  different  parts  of  your  body <period> to  have  a  conversation  with  it <period> to  speak <period> to  listen <period> hup <period> now <comma> it  's  dependent  on  rhythm <comma> and  keeping  a  center  of  balance <period> when  it  falls <comma> going  underneath <period> so <comma> there  's  a  rhythm  to  it <period> the  rhythm  can  get  much  smaller <period> as  your  skill  increases <comma> you  learn  to  find  those  tinier  spaces <comma> those  tinier  movements <period> thanks <period> now <comma> i  'm  going  to  show  you  the  beginnings  of  a  piece  that  is  about  balance  in  some  ways <comma> and  also <comma> oh <comma> actually <comma> if  you  're  bored <comma> not  here <comma> here  's  one  use  for  it <period> you  can  go  with  the  sticks  one  music <period> thanks <period> that  has  a  certain  kind  of  balance  to  it <comma> which  is  all  about  plumb <period> i  apprenticed  with  a  carpenter  and  learned  about  plumb <comma> square  and  level <period> and  they  influenced  that <comma> and  this  next  piece <comma> which  i  'll  do  a  little  segment  of <period> two  sticks <comma> you  can  go  with  it <period> thanks <period> which  is  again  exploring  space <comma> or  the  lines  in  space <period> working  with  space  and  the  lines  in  space  in  a  different  way <period> oh <comma> let  's  see  here <period> so <comma> i  'll  come  back  to  that  in  a  second <period> but  working  with  one  ball <comma> now <comma> what  if  you  attach  something  to  it <comma> or  change  it <period> this  is  a  little  thing  that  i  made  because  i  really  like  the  idea  of  curves  and  balls  together <period> and  then  creating  space  and  the  rhythm  of  space <comma> using  the  surface  of  the  balls <comma> the  surface  of  the  arms <period> just  a  little  toy <period> which  leads  me  to  the  next  thing <comma> which  is <comma> what  have  i  got  here <questionmark> ok <period> all  right <period> i  'm  actually  leading  up  to  something <comma> the  newest  thing  that  i  'm  working  on <period> this  is  not  it <period> this  is  exploring  geometry  and  the  rhythm  of  shape <period> now <comma> what  i  just  did  was  i  worked  with  the  mathematics <comma> the  diameter  and  the  circumference <period> sometimes  these  pieces  are  mathematical <comma> in  that  way  that  i  look  at  a  shape  and  say <comma> what  about  if  i  use  this  and  this  and  this <period> sometimes  what  happens  in  life  affects  my  choice  of  objects  that  i  try  to  work  with <period> the  next  piece  that  i  'm  going  to  do <comma> which  is  the  cylinders  piece <comma> if  you  want  to  get  that  up <comma> it  has  to  do  with  cylinder  seals  from  about  5,000  years  ago <comma> which  were  stones  with  designs  that  were  used  to  roll  over  wet  clay  with  all  sorts  of  great  designs <period> i  love  ceramics  and  all  of  that <period> it  's  a  combination  of  that <comma> the  beauty  of  that <comma> the  shape <comma> and  the  stories  that  were  involved  in  it <comma> as  well  as  the  fact  that  they  protected  the  contents <period> the  second  influence  on  this  piece  came  from  recycling  and  looking  into  a  tin  can  recycling  bin  and  seeing  all  that  beautiful  emptiness <period> so <comma> if  you  want  to  go  with  the  music  for  cylinders <period> talking  about  geometry  and  everything <comma> if  you  take  the  circle  and  you  split  it  in  half  -- <period> can  you  run  s-curve  music <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  do  just  a  short  version  of  it <period> circles  split  in  half  and  rotated <comma> and  mythology <period> anyway <comma> that  piece  also  has  a  kinetic  sculpture  in  the  middle  of  it <comma> and  i  dance  around  a  small  stage  so <comma> two  minutes <comma> just  to  end <questionmark> the  latest  piece  that  i  'm  working  on <comma> what  i  love  is  that  i  never  know  what  i  'm  working  on <comma> why  i  'm  working  on  it <period> they  're  not  ideas <comma> they  're  instincts <period> and  the  latest  thing  that  i  'm  working  on <comma> is  something  really <comma> i  do  n't  know  what  it  is  yet <period> and  that  's  good <period> i  like  not  to  know  for  as  long  as  possible <period> well <comma> because  then  it  tells  me  the  truth <comma> instead  of  me  imposing  the  truth <period> and  what  it  is <comma> is  working  with  both  positive  and  negative  space  but  also  with  these  curves <period> and  what  it  involves <comma> and  i  do  n't  know  if  my  hands  are  too  beaten  up  to  do  it  or  not <comma> but  i  'll  do  a  little  bit  of  it <period> it  initially  started  off  with  me  stacking  these  things <comma> bunches  of  them <comma> and  then  playing  with  the  sense  of  space <comma> of  filling  in  the  space <period> and  then  it  started  changing <comma> and  become  folding  on  themselves <period> and  then  changing  levels <period> because  my  attempt  is  to  make  visual  instruments <comma> not  to  just  make <comma> i  'll  try  one  other  thing <period> for  work  in  three  dimensions <comma> with  your  perceptions  of  space  and  time <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  know  exactly  where  it  's  going <comma> but  i've  got  a  bit  of  effort  involved  in  this  thing <period> and  it  's  going  to  change  as  i  go  through  it <period> but  i  really  like  it <comma> it  feels  right <period> this  may  not  be  the  right  shape <comma> and <comma> look  at  this  shape <comma> and  then  i  'll  show  you  the  first  design  i  ever  put  to  it <comma> just  to  see <comma> just  to  play <comma> because  i  love  all  different  kinds  of  things  to  play  with <period> to  work  with  the  positive  and  negative  in  a  different  way <period> and  to  change <comma> and  to  change <period> so <comma> i  'm  off  in  my  new  direction  with  this  to  explore  rhythm  and  space <period> we  'll  see  what  i  come  up  with <period> thanks  for  having  me <period> when  i  got  my  current  job <comma> i  was  given  a  good  piece  of  advice <comma> which  was  to  interview  three  politicians  every  day <period> and  from  that  much  contact  with  politicians <comma> i  can  tell  you  they  're  all  emotional  freaks  of  one  sort  or  another <period> they  have  what  i  called  logorrhea  dementia <comma> which  is  they  talk  so  much  they  drive  themselves  insane <period> but  what  they  do  have  is  incredible  social  skills <period> when  you  meet  them <comma> they  lock  into  you <comma> they  look  you  in  the  eye <comma> they  invade  your  personal  space <comma> they  massage  the  back  of  your  head <period> i  had  dinner  with  a  republican  senator  several  months  ago  who  kept  his  hand  on  my  inner  thigh  throughout  the  whole  meal <comma> squeezing  it <period> i  once <comma> this  was  years  ago <comma> i  saw  ted  kennedy  and  dan  quayle  meet  in  the  well  of  the  senate <period> and  they  were  friends <comma> and  they  hugged  each  other  and  they  were  laughing <comma> and  their  faces  were  like  this  far  apart <period> and  they  were  moving  and  grinding  and  moving  their  arms  up  and  down  each  other <period> and  i  was  like <comma> get  a  room <period> i  do  n't  want  to  see  this <period> but  they  have  those  social  skills <period> another  case <comma> last  election  cycle <comma> i  was  following  mitt  romney  around  new  hampshire <period> and  he  was  campaigning  with  his  five  perfect  sons <comma> bip <comma> chip <comma> rip <comma> zip <comma> lip  and  dip <period> and  he  's  going  into  a  diner <period> and  he  goes  into  the  diner <comma> introduces  himself  to  a  family  and  says <comma> what  village  are  you  from  in  new  hampshire <questionmark> and  then  he  describes  the  home  he  owned  in  their  village <period> and  so  he  goes  around  the  room <comma> and  then  as  he  's  leaving  the  diner <comma> he  first-names  almost  everybody  he  's  just  met <period> i  was  like <comma> okay <comma> that  's  social  skill <period> but  the  paradox  is <comma> when  a  lot  of  these  people  slip  into  the  policy-making  mode <comma> that  social  awareness  vanishes  and  they  start  talking  like  accountants <period> so  in  the  course  of  my  career <comma> i  have  covered  a  series  of  failures <period> we  sent  economists  in  the  soviet  union  with  privatization  plans  when  it  broke  up <comma> and  what  they  really  lacked  was  social  trust <period> we  invaded  iraq  with  a  military  oblivious  to  the  cultural  and  psychological  realities <period> we  had  a  financial  regulatory  regime  based  on  the  assumptions  that  traders  were  rational  creatures  who  would  n't  do  anything  stupid <period> for  30  years <comma> i've  been  covering  school  reform  and  we've  basically  reorganized  the  bureaucratic  boxes <comma> charters <comma> private  schools <comma> vouchers <comma> but  we've  had  disappointing  results  year  after  year <period> and  the  fact  is <comma> people  learn  from  people  they  love <period> and  if  you  're  not  talking  about  the  individual  relationship  between  a  teacher  and  a  student <comma> you  're  not  talking  about  that  reality <period> but  that  reality  is  expunged  from  our  policy-making  process <period> and  so  that  's  led  to  a  question  for  me <comma> why  are  the  most  socially-attuned  people  on  earth  completely  dehumanized  when  they  think  about  policy <questionmark> and  i  came  to  the  conclusion <comma> this  is  a  symptom  of  a  larger  problem <period> that <comma> for  centuries <comma> we've  inherited  a  view  of  human  nature  based  on  the  notion  that  we  're  divided  selves <comma> that  reason  is  separated  from  the  emotions  and  that  society  progresses  to  the  extent  that  reason  can  suppress  the  passions <period> and  it  's  led  to  a  view  of  human  nature  that  we  're  rational  individuals  who  respond  in  straightforward  ways  to  incentives <period> and  it  's  led  to  ways  of  seeing  the  world  where  people  try  to  use  the  assumptions  of  physics  to  measure  how  human  behavior  is <period> and  it  's  produced  a  great  amputation <comma> a  shallow  view  of  human  nature <period> we  're  really  good  at  talking  about  material  things <comma> but  we  're  really  bad  at  talking  about  emotions <period> we  're  really  good  at  talking  about  skills  and  safety  and  health <period> we  're  really  bad  at  talking  about  character <period> alasdair  macintyre <comma> the  famous  philosopher <comma> said  that <comma> we  have  the  concepts  of  the  ancient  morality  of  virtue <comma> honor <comma> goodness <comma> but  we  no  longer  have  a  system  by  which  to  connect  them <period> and  so  this  has  led  to  a  shallow  path  in  politics <comma> but  also  in  a  whole  range  of  human  endeavors <period> you  can  see  it  in  the  way  we  raise  our  young  kids <period> you  go  to  an  elementary  school  at  three  in  the  afternoon  and  you  watch  the  kids  come  out <comma> and  they  're  wearing  these  80-pound  backpacks <period> if  the  wind  blows  them  over <comma> they  're  like  beetles  stuck  there  on  the  ground <period> you  see  these  cars  that  drive  up <comma> usually  it  's  saabs  and  audis  and  volvos <comma> because  in  certain  neighborhoods  it  's  socially  acceptable  to  have  a  luxury  car <comma> so  long  as  it  comes  from  a  country  hostile  to  us <period> foreign  policy <comma> that  's  fine <period> they  get  picked  up  by  these  creatures  i've  called  uber-moms <comma> who  are  highly  successful  career  women  who  have  taken  time  off  to  make  sure  all  their  kids  get  into  harvard <period> and  you  can  usually  tell  the  uber-moms  because  they  actually  weigh  less  than  their  own  children <period> so  at  the  moment  of  conception <comma> they  're  doing  little  butt  exercises <period> babies  flop  out <comma> they  're  flashing  mandarin  flashcards  at  the  things <period> dr.iving  them  home <comma> and  they  want  them  to  be  enlightened <comma> so  they  take  them  to  ben  &amp <period> jerry  's  ice  cream  company  with  its  own  foreign  policy <period> in  one  of  my  books <comma> i  joke  that  ben  &amp <period> jerry  's  should  make  a  pacifist  toothpaste <comma> does  n't  kill  germs <comma> just  asks  them  to  leave <period> it  would  be  a  big  seller <period> and  they  go  to  whole  foods  to  get  their  baby  formula <period> and  whole  foods  is  one  of  those  progressive  grocery  stores  where  all  the  cashiers  look  like  they  're  on  loan  from  amnesty  international <period> they  buy  these  seaweed-based  snacks  there  called  veggie  booty  with  kale <comma> which  is  for  kids  who  come  home  and  say <comma> mom <comma> mom <comma> i  want  a  snack  that  'll  help  prevent  colon-rectal  cancer <period> and  so  the  kids  are  raised  in  a  certain  way <comma> jumping  through  achievement  hoops  of  the  things  we  can  measure <comma> sat  prep <comma> oboe <comma> soccer  practice <period> they  get  into  competitive  colleges <comma> they  get  good  jobs <comma> and  sometimes  they  make  a  success  of  themselves  in  a  superficial  manner <comma> and  they  make  a  ton  of  money <period> and  sometimes  you  can  see  them  at  vacation  places  like  jackson  hole  or  aspen <period> and  they've  become  elegant  and  slender <comma> they  do  n't  really  have  thighs <period> they  just  have  one  elegant  calve  on  top  of  another <period> they  have  kids  of  their  own <comma> and  they've  achieved  a  genetic  miracle  by  marrying  beautiful  people <comma> so  their  grandmoms  look  like  gertrude  stein <comma> their  daughters  looks  like  halle  berry <comma> i  do  n't  know  how  they've  done  that <period> they  get  there  and  they  realize  it  's  fashionable  now  to  have  dogs  a  third  as  tall  as  your  ceiling  heights <period> so  they've  got  these  furry  160-pound  dogs <comma> all  look  like  velociraptors <comma> all  named  after  jane  austen  characters <period> and  then  when  they  get  old <comma> they  have  n't  really  developed  a  philosophy  of  life <comma> but  they've  decided <comma> i've  been  successful  at  everything <period> i  'm  just  not  going  to  die <period> and  so  they  hire  personal  trainers <period> they  're  popping  cialis  like  breath  mints <period> you  see  them  on  the  mountains  up  there <period> they  're  cross-country  skiing  up  the  mountain  with  these  grim  expressions  that  make  dick  cheney  look  like  jerry  lewis <period> and  as  they  whiz  by  you <comma> it  's  like  being  passed  by  a  little  iron  raisinet  going  up  the  hill <period> and  so  this  is  part  of  what  life  is <comma> but  it  's  not  all  of  what  life  is <period> and  over  the  past  few  years <comma> i  think  we've  been  given  a  deeper  view  of  human  nature  and  a  deeper  view  of  who  we  are <period> and  it  's  not  based  on  theology  or  philosophy <comma> it  's  in  the  study  of  the  mind <comma> across  all  these  spheres  of  research <comma> from  neuroscience  to  the  cognitive  scientists <comma> behavioral  economists <comma> psychologists <comma> sociology <comma> we  're  developing  a  revolution  in  consciousness <period> and  when  you  synthesize  it  all <comma> it  's  giving  us  a  new  view  of  human  nature <period> and  far  from  being  a  coldly  materialistic  view  of  nature <comma> it  's  a  new  humanism <comma> it  's  a  new  enchantment <period> and  i  think  when  you  synthesize  this  research <comma> you  start  with  three  key  insights <period> the  first  insight  is  that  while  the  conscious  mind  writes  the  autobiography  of  our  species <comma> the  unconscious  mind  does  most  of  the  work <period> and  so  one  way  to  formulate  that  is  the  human  mind  can  take  in  millions  of  pieces  of  information  a  minute <comma> of  which  it  can  be  consciously  aware  of  about  40 <period> and  this  leads  to  oddities <period> one  of  my  favorite  is  that  people  named  dennis  are  disproportionately  likely  to  become  dentists <comma> people  named  lawrence  become  lawyers <comma> because  unconsciously  we  gravitate  toward  things  that  sound  familiar <comma> which  is  why  i  named  my  daughter  president  of  the  united  states  brooks <period> another  finding  is  that  the  unconscious <comma> far  from  being  dumb  and  sexualized <comma> is  actually  quite  smart <period> so  one  of  the  most  cognitively  demanding  things  we  do  is  buy  furniture <period> it  's  really  hard  to  imagine  a  sofa <comma> how  it  's  going  to  look  in  your  house <period> and  the  way  you  should  do  that  is  study  the  furniture <comma> let  it  marinate  in  your  mind <comma> distract  yourself <comma> and  then  a  few  days  later <comma> go  with  your  gut <comma> because  unconsciously  you've  figured  it  out <period> the  second  insight  is  that  emotions  are  at  the  center  of  our  thinking <period> people  with  strokes  and  lesions  in  the  emotion-processing  parts  of  the  brain  are  not  super  smart <comma> they  're  actually  sometimes  quite  helpless <period> and  the  giant  in  the  field  is  in  the  room  tonight  and  is  speaking  tomorrow  morning <comma> antonio  damasio <period> and  one  of  the  things  he  's  really  shown  us  is  that  emotions  are  not  separate  from  reason <comma> but  they  are  the  foundation  of  reason  because  they  tell  us  what  to  value <period> and  so  reading  and  educating  your  emotions  is  one  of  the  central  activities  of  wisdom <period> now  i  'm  a  middle-aged  guy <period> i  'm  not  exactly  comfortable  with  emotions <period> one  of  my  favorite  brain  stories  described  these  middle-aged  guys <period> they  put  them  into  a  brain  scan  machine <comma> this  is  apocryphal  by  the  way <comma> but  i  do  n't  care <comma> and  they  had  them  watch  a  horror  movie <comma> and  then  they  had  them  describe  their  feelings  toward  their  wives <period> and  the  brain  scans  were  identical  in  both  activities <period> it  was  just  sheer  terror <period> so  me  talking  about  emotion  is  like  gandhi  talking  about  gluttony <comma> but  it  is  the  central  organizing  process  of  the  way  we  think <period> it  tells  us  what  to  imprint <period> the  brain  is  the  record  of  the  feelings  of  a  life <period> and  the  third  insight  is  that  we  're  not  primarily  self-contained  individuals <period> we  're  social  animals <comma> not  rational  animals <period> we  emerge  out  of  relationships <comma> and  we  are  deeply  interpenetrated <comma> one  with  another <period> and  so  when  we  see  another  person <comma> we  reenact  in  our  own  minds  what  we  see  in  their  minds <period> when  we  watch  a  car  chase  in  a  movie <comma> it  's  almost  as  if  we  are  subtly  having  a  car  chase <period> when  we  watch  pornography <comma> it  's  a  little  like  having  sex <comma> though  probably  not  as  good <period> and  we  see  this  when  lovers  walk  down  the  street <comma> when  a  crowd  in  egypt  or  tunisia  gets  caught  up  in  an  emotional  contagion <comma> the  deep  interpenetration <period> and  this  revolution  in  who  we  are  gives  us  a  different  way  of  seeing <comma> i  think <comma> politics <comma> a  different  way <comma> most  importantly <comma> of  seeing  human  capital <period> we  are  now  children  of  the  french  enlightenment <period> we  believe  that  reason  is  the  highest  of  the  faculties <period> but  i  think  this  research  shows  that  the  british  enlightenment <comma> or  the  scottish  enlightenment <comma> with  david  hume <comma> adam  smith <comma> actually  had  a  better  handle  on  who  we  are <comma> that  reason  is  often  weak <comma> our  sentiments  are  strong <comma> and  our  sentiments  are  often  trustworthy <period> and  this  work  corrects  that  bias  in  our  culture <comma> that  dehumanizing  bias <period> it  gives  us  a  deeper  sense  of  what  it  actually  takes  for  us  to  thrive  in  this  life <period> when  we  think  about  human  capital  we  think  about  the  things  we  can  measure  easily <comma> things  like  grades <comma> sat  's <comma> degrees <comma> the  number  of  years  in  schooling <period> what  it  really  takes  to  do  well <comma> to  lead  a  meaningful  life <comma> are  things  that  are  deeper <comma> things  we  do  n't  really  even  have  words  for <period> and  so  let  me  list  just  a  couple  of  the  things  i  think  this  research  points  us  toward  trying  to  understand <period> the  first  gift <comma> or  talent <comma> is  mindsight <comma> the  ability  to  enter  into  other  people  's  minds  and  learn  what  they  have  to  offer <period> babies  come  with  this  ability <period> meltzoff <comma> who  's  at  the  university  of  washington <comma> leaned  over  a  baby  who  was  43  minutes  old <period> he  wagged  his  tongue  at  the  baby <period> the  baby  wagged  her  tongue  back <period> babies  are  born  to  interpenetrate  into  mom  's  mind  and  to  download  what  they  find <comma> their  models  of  how  to  understand  reality <period> in  the  united  states <comma> 55  percent  of  babies  have  a  deep  two-way  conversation  with  mom  and  they  learn  models  to  how  to  relate  to  other  people <period> and  those  people  who  have  models  of  how  to  relate  have  a  huge  head  start  in  life <period> scientists  at  the  university  of  minnesota  did  a  study  in  which  they  could  predict  with  77  percent  accuracy <comma> at  age  18  months <comma> who  was  going  to  graduate  from  high  school <comma> based  on  who  had  good  attachment  with  mom <period> twenty  percent  of  kids  do  not  have  those  relationships <period> they  are  what  we  call  avoidantly  attached <period> they  have  trouble  relating  to  other  people <period> they  go  through  life  like  sailboats  tacking  into  the  wind <comma> wanting  to  get  close  to  people <comma> but  not  really  having  the  models  of  how  to  do  that <period> and  so  this  is  one  skill  of  how  to  hoover  up  knowledge <comma> one  from  another <period> a  second  skill  is  equal  poise <period> the  ability  to  have  the  serenity  to  read  the  biases  and  failures  in  your  own  mind <period> so  for  example <comma> we  are  overconfidence  machines <period> ninety-five  percent  of  our  professors  report  that  they  are  above-average  teachers <period> ninety-six  percent  of  college  students  say  they  have  above-average  social  skills <period> time  magazine  asked  americans <comma> are  you  in  the  top  one  percent  of  earners <questionmark> nineteen  percent  of  americans  are  in  the  top  one  percent  of  earners <period> this  is  a  gender-linked  trait <comma> by  the  way <period> men  drown  at  twice  the  rate  of  women <period> because  men  think  they  can  swim  across  that  lake <period> but  some  people  have  the  ability  and  awareness  of  their  own  biases <comma> their  own  overconfidence <period> they  have  epistemological  modesty <period> they  are  open-minded  in  the  face  of  ambiguity <period> they  are  able  to  adjust  strength  of  the  conclusions  to  the  strength  of  their  evidence <period> they  are  curious <period> and  these  traits  are  often  unrelated  and  uncorrelated  with  iq <period> the  third  trait  is  metis <comma> what  we  might  call  street  smarts <comma> it  's  a  greek  word <period> it  's  a  sensitivity  to  the  physical  environment <comma> the  ability  to  pick  out  patterns  in  an  environment <comma> derive  a  gist <period> one  of  my  colleagues  at  the  times  did  a  great  story  about  soldiers  in  iraq  who  could  look  down  a  street  and  detect  somehow  whether  there  was  an  ied <comma> a  landmine <comma> in  the  street <period> they  could  n't  tell  you  how  they  did  it <comma> but  they  could  feel  cold <comma> they  felt  a  coldness <comma> and  they  were  more  often  right  than  wrong <period> the  third  is  what  you  might  call  sympathy <comma> the  ability  to  work  within  groups <period> and  that  comes  in  tremendously  handy <comma> because  groups  are  smarter  than  individuals <period> and  face-to-face  groups  are  much  smarter  than  groups  that  communicate  electronically <comma> because  90  percent  of  our  communication  is  non-verbal <period> and  the  effectiveness  of  a  group  is  not  determined  by  the  iq  of  the  group <period> it  's  determined  by  how  well  they  communicate <comma> how  often  they  take  turns  in  conversation <period> then  you  could  talk  about  a  trait  like  blending <period> any  child  can  say <comma> i  'm  a  tiger <comma> pretend  to  be  a  tiger <period> it  seems  so  elementary <period> but  in  fact <comma> it  's  phenomenally  complicated  to  take  a  concept  i  and  a  concept  tiger  and  blend  them  together <period> but  this  is  the  source  of  innovation <period> what  picasso  did <comma> for  example <comma> was  take  the  concept  western  art  and  the  concept  african  masks  and  blend  them  together <comma> not  only  the  geometry <comma> but  the  moral  systems  entailed  in  them <period> and  these  are  skills <comma> again <comma> we  cannot  count  and  measure <period> and  then  the  final  thing  i  'll  mention  is  something  you  might  call  limerence <period> and  this  is  not  an  ability <period> it  's  a  drive  and  a  motivation <period> the  conscious  mind  hungers  for  success  and  prestige <period> the  unconscious  mind  hungers  for  those  moments  of  transcendence <comma> when  the  skull  line  disappears  and  we  are  lost  in  a  challenge  or  a  task <comma> when  a  craftsman  feels  lost  in  his  craft <comma> when  a  naturalist  feels  at  one  with  nature <comma> when  a  believer  feels  at  one  with  god  's  love <period> that  is  what  the  unconscious  mind  hungers  for <period> and  many  of  us  feel  it  in  love  when  lovers  feel  fused <period> and  one  of  the  most  beautiful  descriptions  i've  come  across  in  this  research  of  how  minds  interpenetrate  was  written  by  a  great  theorist  and  scientist  named  douglas  hofstadter  at  the  university  of  indiana <period> he  was  married  to  a  woman  named  carol <comma> and  they  had  a  wonderful  relationship <period> when  their  kids  were  five  and  two <comma> carol  had  a  stroke  and  a  brain  tumor  and  died  suddenly <period> and  hofstadter  wrote  a  book  called  i  am  a  strange  loop <period> in  the  course  of  that  book <comma> he  describes  a  moment <comma> just  months  after  carol  has  died <comma> he  comes  across  her  picture  on  the  mantel <comma> or  on  a  bureau  in  his  bedroom <period> and  here  's  what  he  wrote <comma> i  looked  at  her  face <comma> and  i  looked  so  deeply  that  i  felt  i  was  behind  her  eyes <period> and  all  at  once  i  found  myself  saying  as  tears  flowed <comma> that  's  me <period> that  's  me' <period> and  those  simple  words  brought  back  many  thoughts  that  i  had  had  before <comma> about  the  fusion  of  our  souls  into  one  higher-level  entity <comma> about  the  fact  that  at  the  core  of  both  our  souls  lay  our  identical  hopes  and  dreams  for  our  children <comma> about  the  notion  that  those  hopes  were  not  separate  or  distinct  hopes <comma> but  were  just  one  hope <comma> one  clear  thing  that  defined  us  both <comma> that  welded  us  into  a  unit <comma> the  kind  of  unit  i  had  but  dimly  imagined  before  being  married  and  having  children <period> i  realized  that <comma> though  carol  had  died <comma> that  core  piece  of  her  had  not  died  at  all <comma> but  had  lived  on  very  determinedly  in  my  brain <period> the  greeks  say  we  suffer  our  way  to  wisdom <period> through  his  suffering <comma> hofstadter  understood  how  deeply  interpenetrated  we  are <period> through  the  policy  failures  of  the  last  30  years <comma> we  have  come  to  acknowledge <comma> i  think <comma> how  shallow  our  view  of  human  nature  has  been <period> and  now  as  we  confront  that  shallowness  and  the  failures  that  derive  from  our  inability  to  get  the  depths  of  who  we  are <comma> comes  this  revolution  in  consciousness <comma> these  people  in  so  many  fields  exploring  the  depth  of  our  nature  and  coming  away  with  this  enchanted <comma> this  new  humanism <period> and  when  freud  discovered  his  sense  of  the  unconscious <comma> it  had  a  vast  effect  on  the  climate  of  the  times <period> now  we  are  discovering  a  more  accurate  vision  of  the  unconscious <comma> of  who  we  are  deep  inside <period> and  it  's  going  to  have  a  wonderful  and  profound  and  humanizing  effect  on  our  culture <period> thank  you <period> both  myself  and  my  brother  belong  to  the  under  30  demographic <comma> which  pat  said  makes  70  percent <comma> but  according  to  our  statistics  it  makes  60  percent  of  the  region  's  population <period> qatar  is  no  exception  to  the  region <period> it  's  a  very  young  nation  led  by  young  people <period> we  have  been  reminiscing  about  the  latest  technologies  and  the  ipods <comma> and  for  me  the  abaya <comma> my  traditional  dress  that  i  'm  wearing  today <period> now  this  is  not  a  religious  garment <comma> nor  is  it  a  religious  statement <period> instead <comma> it  's  a  diverse  cultural  statement  that  we  choose  to  wear <period> now  i  remember  a  few  years  ago <comma> a  journalist  asked  dr.  sheikha <comma> who  's  sitting  here <comma> president  of  qatar  university <comma> who <comma> by  the  way <comma> is  a  woman <comma> he  asked  her  whether  she  thought  the  abaya  hindered  or  infringed  her  freedom  in  any  way <period> her  answer  was  quite  the  contrary <period> instead <comma> she  felt  more  free <comma> more  free  because  she  could  wear  whatever  she  wanted  under  the  abaya <period> she  could  come  to  work  in  her  pajamas  and  nobody  would  care <period> not  that  you  do <period> i  'm  just  saying <period> my  point  is  here <comma> people  have  a  choice <comma> just  like  the  indian  lady  could  wear  her  sari  or  the  japanese  woman  could  wear  her  kimono <period> we  are  changing  our  culture  from  within <comma> but  at  the  same  time  we  are  reconnecting  with  our  traditions <period> we  know  that  modernization  is  happening <period> and  yes <comma> qatar  wants  to  be  a  modern  nation <period> but  at  the  same  time  we  are  reconnecting  and  reasserting  our  arab  heritage <period> it  's  important  for  us  to  grow  organically <period> and  we  continuously  make  the  conscious  decision  to  reach  that  balance <period> in  fact <comma> research  has  shown  that  the  more  the  world  is  flat <comma> if  i  use  tom  friedman  's  analogy <comma> or  global <comma> the  more  and  more  people  are  wanting  to  be  different <period> and  for  us  young  people <comma> they  're  looking  to  become  individuals  and  find  their  differences  amongst  themselves <period> which  is  why  i  prefer  the  richard  wilk  analogy  of  globalizing  the  local  and  localizing  the  global <period> we  do  n't  want  to  be  all  the  same <comma> but  we  want  to  respect  each  other  and  understand  each  other <period> and  therefore  tradition  becomes  more  important <comma> not  less  important <period> life  necessitates  a  universal  world <comma> however <comma> we  believe  in  the  security  of  having  a  local  identity <period> and  this  is  what  the  leaders  of  this  region  are  trying  to  do <period> we  're  trying  to  be  part  of  this  global  village <comma> but  at  the  same  time  we  're  revising  ourselves  through  our  cultural  institutions  and  cultural  development <period> i  'm  a  representation  of  that  phenomenon <period> and  i  think  a  lot  of  people  in  this  room <comma> i  can  see  a  lot  of  you  are  in  the  same  position  as  myself <period> and  i  'm  sure <comma> although  we  cannot  see  the  people  in  washington <comma> they  are  in  the  same  position <period> we  're  continuously  trying  to  straddle  different  worlds <comma> different  cultures  and  trying  to  meet  the  challenges  of  a  different  expectation  from  ourselves  and  from  others <period> so  i  want  to  ask  a  question <comma> what  should  culture  in  the  21st  century  look  like <questionmark> in  a  time  where  the  world  is  becoming  personalized <comma> when  the  mobile  phone <comma> the  burger <comma> the  telephone <comma> everything  has  its  own  personal  identity <comma> how  should  we  perceive  ourselves <period> and  how  should  we  perceive  others <questionmark> how  does  that  impact  our  desert  culture <questionmark> i  'm  not  sure  of  how  many  of  you  in  washington  are  aware  of  the  cultural  developments  happening  in  the  region  and <comma> the  more  recent <comma> museum  of  islamic  art  opened  in  qatar  in  2008 <period> i  myself  am  personalizing  these  cultural  developments <comma> but  i  also  understand  that  this  has  to  be  done  organically <period> yes <comma> we  do  have  all  the  resources  that  we  need  in  order  to  develop  new  cultural  institutions <comma> but  what  i  think  is  more  important  is  that  we  are  very  fortunate  to  have  visionary  leaders  who  understand  that  this  cannot  happen  from  outside <comma> it  has  to  come  from  within <period> and  guess  what <questionmark> you  might  be  surprised  to  know  that  most  people  in  the  gulf  who  are  leading  these  cultural  initiatives  happen  to  be  women <period> i  want  to  ask  you <comma> why  do  you  think  this  is <questionmark> is  it  because  it  's  a  soft  option <period> we  have  nothing  else  to  do <questionmark> no <comma> i  do  n't  think  so <period> i  think  that  women  in  this  part  of  the  world  realize  that  culture  is  an  important  component  to  connect  people  both  locally  and  regionally <period> it  's  a  natural  component  for  bringing  people  together <comma> discussing  ideas <comma> in  the  same  way  we  're  doing  here  at  ted <period> we  're  here <comma> we  're  part  of  a  community <comma> sharing  out  ideas  and  discussing  them <period> art  becomes  a  very  important  part  of  our  national  identity <period> the  existential  and  social  and  political  impact  an  artist  has  on  his  nation  's  development  of  cultural  identity  is  very  important <period> you  know <comma> art  and  culture  is  big  business <period> ask  me <period> ask  the  chairpersons  and  ceos  of  sotheby  's  and  christie  's <period> ask  charles  saatchi  about  great  art <period> they  make  a  lot  of  money <period> so  i  think  women  in  our  society  are  becoming  leaders <comma> because  they  realize  that  for  their  future  generations <comma> it  's  very  important  to  maintain  our  cultural  identities <period> why  else  do  greeks  demand  the  return  of  the  elgin  marbles <questionmark> and  why  is  there  an  uproar  when  a  private  collector  tries  to  sell  his  collection  to  a  foreign  museum <questionmark> why  does  it  take  me  months  on  end  to  get  an  export  license  from  london  or  new  york  in  order  to  get  pieces  into  my  country <questionmark> in  few  hours <comma> shirin  neshat <comma> my  friend  from  iran  who  's  a  very  important  artist  for  us  will  be  talking  to  you <period> she  lives  in  new  york  city <comma> but  she  does  n't  try  to  be  a  western  artist <period> instead <comma> she  tries  to  engage  in  a  very  important  dialogue  about  her  culture <comma> nation  and  heritage <period> she  does  that  through  important  visual  forms  of  photography  and  film <period> in  the  same  way <comma> qatar  is  trying  to  grow  its  national  museums  through  an  organic  process  from  within <period> our  mission  is  of  cultural  integration  and  independence <period> we  do  n't  want  to  have  what  there  is  in  the  west <period> we  do  n't  want  their  collections <period> we  want  to  build  our  own  identities <comma> our  own  fabric <comma> create  an  open  dialogue  so  that  we  share  our  ideas  and  share  yours  with  us <period> in  a  few  days <comma> we  will  be  opening  the  arab  museum  of  modern  art <period> we  have  done  extensive  research  to  ensure  that  arab  and  muslim  artists <comma> and  arabs  who  are  not  muslims <comma> not  all  arabs  are  muslims <comma> by  the  way <comma> but  we  make  sure  that  they  are  represented  in  this  new  institution <period> this  institution  is  government-backed  and  it  has  been  the  case  for  the  past  three  decades <period> we  will  open  the  museum  in  a  few  days <comma> and  i  welcome  all  of  you  to  get  on  qatar  airways  and  come  and  join  us <period> now  this  museum  is  just  as  important  to  us  as  the  west <period> some  of  you  might  have  heard  of  the  algerian  artist  baya  mahieddine <comma> but  i  doubt  a  lot  of  people  know  that  this  artist  worked  in  picasso  's  studio  in  paris  in  the  1930s <period> for  me  it  was  a  new  discovery <period> and  i  think  with  time <comma> in  the  years  to  come  we  'll  be  learning  a  lot  about  our  picassos <comma> our  legers  and  our  cezannes <period> we  do  have  artists <comma> but  unfortunately  we  have  not  discovered  them  yet <period> now  visual  expression  is  just  one  form  of  culture  integration <period> we  have  realized  that  recently  more  and  more  people  are  using  the  means  of  youtube  and  social  networking  to  express  their  stories <comma> share  their  photos  and  tell  their  own  stories  through  their  own  voices <period> in  a  similar  way <comma> we  have  created  the  doha  film  institute <period> now  the  doha  film  institute  is  an  organization  to  teach  people  about  film  and  filmmaking <period> last  year  we  did  n't  have  one  qatari  woman  filmmaker <period> today  i  am  proud  to  say  we  have  trained  and  educated  over  66  qatari  women  filmmakers  to  edit <comma> tell  their  own  stories  in  their  own  voices <period> now  if  you  'll  allow  me <comma> i  would  love  to  share  a  one-minute  film  that  has  proven  to  show  that  a  60-sec  film  can  be  as  powerful  as  a  haiku  in  telling  a  big  picture <period> and  this  is  one  of  our  filmmakers  products <period> boy <comma> hey  listen <period> did  you  know  that  the  stocks  are  up <questionmark> who  are  you  playing <questionmark> girl <comma> uncle  khaled <period> here <comma> put  on  the  headscarf <period> khaled <comma> why  would  i  want  to  put  it  on <questionmark> girl <comma> do  as  you  're  told <comma> young  girl <period> boy <comma> no <comma> you  play  mom  and  i  play  dad <period> play  by  yourself  then <period> girl <comma> women <period> one  word  and  they  get  upset <period> useless <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> sm <comma> going  back  to  straddling  between  east  and  west <comma> last  month  we  had  our  second  doha  tribeca  film  festival  here  in  doha <period> the  doha  tribeca  film  festival  was  held  at  our  new  cultural  hub <comma> katara <period> it  attracted  42,000  people <comma> and  we  showcased  51  films <period> now  the  doha  tribeca  film  festival  is  not  an  imported  festival <comma> but  rather  an  important  festival  between  the  cities  of  new  york  and  doha <period> it  's  important  for  two  things <period> first <comma> it  allows  us  to  showcase  our  arab  filmmakers  and  voices  to  one  of  the  most  cosmopolitan  cities  in  the  world <comma> new  york  city <period> at  the  same  time <comma> we  are  inviting  them  to  come  and  explore  our  part  of  the  world <period> they  're  learning  our  culture <comma> our  language <comma> our  heritage  and  realizing  we  're  just  as  different  and  just  the  same  as  each  other <period> now  over  and  over  again <comma> people  have  said <comma> let  's  build  bridges <comma> and  frankly <comma> i  want  to  do  more  than  that <period> i  would  like  break  the  walls  of  ignorance  between  east  and  west <comma> no <comma> not  the  soft  option  that  we  have  discussed  before <comma> but  rather  the  soft  power  that  joseph  nye  has  spoken  about  before <period> culture  's  a  very  important  tool  to  bring  people  together <period> we  should  not  underestimate  it <period> know  thyself <comma> that  is  the  journey  of  self-expression  and  self-realization  that  we  are  traveling <period> now  i  do  n't  pretend  to  have  all  the  answers <comma> but  i  know  that  me  as  an  individual  and  we  as  a  nation  welcome  this  community  of  ideas  worth  spreading <period> this  is  a  very  interesting  journey <period> i  welcome  you  on  board  for  us  to  engage  and  discuss  new  ideas  of  how  to  bring  people  together  through  cultural  initiatives  and  discussions <period> familiarity  destroys  and  trumps  fear <period> try  it <period> ladies  and  gentlemen <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> shokran <period> when  i  'm  starting  talks  like  this <comma> i  usually  do  a  whole  spiel  about  sustainability  because  a  lot  of  people  out  there  do  n't  know  what  that  is <period> this  is  a  crowd  that  does  know  what  it  is <comma> so  i  'll  like  just  do  like  the  60-second  crib-note  version <period> right <questionmark> so  just  bear  with  me <period> we  'll  go  real  fast <comma> you  know <questionmark> fill  in  the  blanks <period> so <comma> you  know <comma> sustainability <comma> small  planet <period> right <questionmark> picture  a  little  earth <comma> circling  around  the  sun <period> you  know <comma> about  a  million  years  ago <comma> a  bunch  of  monkeys  fell  out  of  trees <comma> got  a  little  clever <comma> harnessed  fire <comma> invented  the  printing  press <comma> made <comma> you  know <comma> luggage  with  wheels  on  it <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> built  the  society  that  we  now  live  in <period> unfortunately <comma> while  this  society  is <comma> without  a  doubt <comma> the  most  prosperous  and  dynamic  the  world  has  ever  created <comma> it  's  got  some  major <comma> major  flaws <period> one  of  them  is  that  every  society  has  an  ecological  footprint <period> it  has  an  amount  of  impact  on  the  planet  that  's  measurable <period> how  much  stuff  goes  through  your  life <comma> how  much  waste  is  left  behind  you <period> and  we <comma> at  the  moment <comma> in  our  society <comma> have  a  really  dramatically  unsustainable  level  of  this <period> we  're  using  up  about  five  planets <period> if  everybody  on  the  planet  lived  the  way  we  did <comma> we'd  need  between  five <comma> six <comma> seven <comma> some  people  even  say  10  planets  to  make  it <period> clearly  we  do  n't  have  10  planets <period> again <comma> you  know <comma> mental <comma> visual <comma> 10  planets <comma> one  planet <comma> 10  planets <comma> one  planet <period> right <questionmark> we  do  n't  have  that <period> so  that  's  one  problem <period> the  second  problem  is  that  the  planet  that  we  have  is  being  used  in  wildly  unfair  ways <period> right <questionmark> north  americans <comma> such  as  myself <comma> you  know <comma> we  're  basically  sort  of  wallowing <comma> gluttonous  hogs <comma> and  we  're  eating  all  sorts  of  stuff <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> then  you  get  all  the  way  down  to  people  who  live  in  the  asia-pacific  region <comma> or  even  more <comma> africa <period> and  people  simply  do  not  have  enough  to  survive <period> this  is  producing  all  sorts  of  tensions <comma> all  sorts  of  dynamics  that  are  deeply  disturbing <period> and  there  's  more  and  more  people  on  the  way <period> right <questionmark> so <comma> this  is  what  the  planet  's  going  to  look  like  in  20  years <period> it  's  going  to  be  a  pretty  crowded  place <comma> at  least  eight  billion  people <period> so  to  make  matters  even  more  difficult <comma> it  's  a  very  young  planet <period> a  third  of  the  people  on  this  planet  are  kids <period> and  those  kids  are  growing  up  in  a  completely  different  way  than  their  parents  did <comma> no  matter  where  they  live <period> they've  been  exposed  to  this  idea  of  our  society <comma> of  our  prosperity <period> and  they  may  not  want  to  live  exactly  like  us <period> they  may  not  want  to  be  americans <comma> or  brits <comma> or  germans <comma> or  south  africans <comma> but  they  want  their  own  version  of  a  life  which  is  more  prosperous <comma> and  more  dynamic <comma> and  more <comma> you  know <comma> enjoyable <period> and  all  of  these  things  combine  to  create  an  enormous  amount  of  torque  on  the  planet <period> and  if  we  cannot  figure  out  a  way  to  deal  with  that  torque <comma> we  are  going  to  find  ourselves  more  and  more  and  more  quickly  facing  situations  which  are  simply  unthinkable <period> everybody  in  this  room  has  heard  the  worst-case  scenarios <period> i  do  n't  need  to  go  into  that <period> but  i  will  ask  the  question <comma> what  's  the  alternative <questionmark> and  i  would  say  that <comma> at  the  moment <comma> the  alternative  is  unimaginable <period> you  know <comma> so  on  the  one  hand  we  have  the  unthinkable <period> on  the  other  hand  we  have  the  unimaginable <period> we  do  n't  know  yet  how  to  build  a  society  which  is  environmentally  sustainable <comma> which  is  shareable  with  everybody  on  the  planet <comma> which  promotes  stability  and  democracy  and  human  rights <comma> and  which  is  achievable  in  the  time-frame  necessary  to  make  it  through  the  challenges  we  face <period> we  do  n't  know  how  to  do  this  yet <period> so  what  's  worldchanging <questionmark> well <comma> worldchanging  you  might  think  of  as  being  a  bit  of  a  news  service  for  the  unimaginable  future <period> you  know <comma> what  we  're  out  there  doing  is  looking  for  examples  of  tools <comma> models  and  ideas <comma> which <comma> if  widely  adopted <comma> would  change  the  game <period> a  lot  of  times <comma> when  i  do  a  talk  like  this <comma> i  talk  about  things  that  everybody  in  this  room  i  'm  sure  has  already  heard  of <comma> but  most  people  have  n't <period> so  i  thought  today  i'd  do  something  a  little  different <comma> and  talk  about  what  we  're  looking  for <comma> rather  than  saying <comma> you  know <comma> rather  than  giving  you  tried-and-true  examples <period> talk  about  the  kinds  of  things  we  're  scoping  out <period> give  you  a  little  peek  into  our  editorial  notebook <period> and  given  that  i  have  13  minutes  to  do  this <comma> this  is  going  to  go  kind  of  quick <period> so <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> just  stick  with  me <period> right <questionmark> so <comma> first  of  all <comma> what  are  we  looking  for <questionmark> bright  green  city <period> one  of  the  biggest  levers  that  we  have  in  the  developed  world  for  changing  the  impact  that  we  have  on  the  planet  is  changing  the  way  that  we  live  in  cities <period> we  're  already  an  urban  planet <period> that  's  especially  true  in  the  developed  world <period> and  people  who  live  in  cities  in  the  developed  world  tend  to  be  very  prosperous <comma> and  thus  use  a  lot  of  stuff <period> if  we  can  change  the  dynamic <comma> by  first  of  all  creating  cities  that  are  denser  and  more  livable <period> here <comma> for  example <comma> is  vancouver <comma> which  if  you  have  n't  been  there <comma> you  ought  to  go  for  a  visit <period> it  's  a  fabulous  city <period> and  they  are  doing  density <comma> new  density <comma> better  than  probably  anybody  else  on  the  planet  right  now <period> they  're  actually  managing  to  talk  north  americans  out  of  driving  cars <comma> which  is  a  pretty  great  thing <period> so  you  have  density <period> you  also  have  growth  management <period> you  leave  aside  what  is  natural  to  be  natural <period> this  is  in  portland <period> that  is  an  actual  development <period> that  land  there  will  remain  pasture  in  perpetuity <period> they've  bounded  the  city  with  a  line <period> nature <comma> city <period> nothing  changes <period> once  you  do  those  things <comma> you  can  start  making  all  sorts  of  investments <period> you  can  start  doing  things  like <comma> you  know <comma> transit  systems  that  actually  work  to  transport  people <comma> in  effective  and  reasonably  comfortable  manners <period> you  can  also  start  to  change  what  you  build <period> this  is  the  beddington  zero  energy  development  in  london <comma> which  is  one  of  the  greenest  buildings  in  the  world <period> it  's  a  fabulous  place <period> we  're  able  to  now  build  buildings  that  generate  all  their  own  electricity <comma> that  recycle  much  of  their  water <comma> that  are  much  more  comfortable  than  standard  buildings <comma> use  all-natural  light <comma> etc <comma> and <comma> over  time <comma> cost  less <period> green  roofs <period> bill  mcdonough  covered  that  last  night <comma> so  i  wo  n't  dwell  on  that  too  much <period> but  once  you  also  have  people  living  in  close  proximity  to  each  other <comma> one  of  the  things  you  can  do  is <comma> as  information  technologies  develop <comma> you  can  start  to  have  smart  places <period> you  can  start  to  know  where  things  are <period> when  you  know  where  things  are <comma> it  becomes  easier  to  share  them <period> when  you  share  them <comma> you  end  up  using  less <period> so  one  great  example  is  car-share  clubs <comma> which  are  really  starting  to  take  off  in  the  us <comma> have  already  taken  off  in  many  places  in  europe <comma> and  are  a  great  example <period> if  you  're  somebody  who  drives <comma> you  know <comma> one  day  a  week <comma> do  you  really  need  your  own  car <questionmark> another  thing  that  information  technology  lets  us  do  is  start  figuring  out  how  to  use  less  stuff  by  knowing <comma> and  by  monitoring <comma> the  amount  we  're  actually  using <period> so <comma> here  's  a  power  cord  which  glows  brighter  the  more  energy  that  you  use <comma> which  i  think  is  a  pretty  cool  concept <comma> although  i  think  it  ought  to  work  the  other  way  around <comma> that  it  gets  brighter  the  more  you  do  n't  use <period> but <comma> you  know <comma> there  may  even  be  a  simpler  approach <period> we  could  just  re-label  things <period> this  light  switch  that  reads <comma> on  the  one  hand <comma> flashfloods <comma> and  on  the  other  hand <comma> off <period> how  we  build  things  can  change  as  well <period> this  is  a  bio-morphic  building <period> it  takes  its  inspiration  in  form  from  life <period> many  of  these  buildings  are  incredibly  beautiful <comma> and  also  much  more  effective <period> this  is  an  example  of  bio-mimicry <comma> which  is  something  we  're  really  starting  to  look  a  lot  more  for <period> in  this  case <comma> you  have  a  shell  design  which  was  used  to  create  a  new  kind  of  exhaust  fan <comma> which  is  greatly  more  effective <period> there  's  a  lot  of  this  stuff  happening <period> it  's  really  pretty  remarkable <period> i  encourage  you  to  look  on  worldchanging  if  you  're  into  it <period> we  're  starting  to  cover  this  more  and  more <period> there  's  also  neo-biological  design <comma> where  more  and  more  we  're  actually  using  life  itself  and  the  processes  of  life  to  become  part  of  our  industry <period> so  this <comma> for  example <comma> is  hydrogen-generating  algae <period> so  we  have  a  model  in  potential <comma> an  emerging  model  that  we  're  looking  for  of  how  to  take  the  cities  most  of  us  live  in <comma> and  turn  them  into  bright  green  cities <period> but  unfortunately <comma> most  of  the  people  on  the  planet  do  n't  live  in  the  cites  we  live  in <period> they  live  in  the  emerging  megacities  of  the  developing  world <period> and  there  's  a  statistic  i  often  like  to  use <comma> which  is  that  we  're  adding  a  city  of  seattle  every  four  days <comma> a  city  the  size  of  seattle  to  the  planet  every  four  days <period> i  was  giving  a  talk  about  two  months  ago <comma> and  this  guy <comma> who'd  done  some  work  with  the  un <comma> came  up  to  me  and  was  really  flustered <comma> and  he  said <comma> look <comma> you've  got  that  totally  wrong <period> it  's  totally  wrong <period> it  's  every  seven  days <period> so <comma> we  're  adding  a  city  the  size  of  seattle  every  seven  days <comma> and  most  of  those  cities  look  more  like  this  than  the  city  that  you  or  i  live  in <period> most  of  those  cites  are  growing  incredibly  quickly <period> they  do  n't  have  existing  infrastructure <period> they  have  enormous  numbers  of  people  who  are  struggling  with  poverty <comma> and  enormous  numbers  of  people  are  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  do  things  in  new  ways <period> so  what  do  we  need  in  order  to  make  developing  nation  megacities  into  bright  green  megacities <questionmark> well <comma> the  first  thing  we  need  is <comma> we  need  leapfrogging <period> and  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  looking  for  everywhere <period> the  idea  behind  leapfrogging  is  that  if  you  are  a  person <comma> or  a  country <comma> who  is  stuck  in  a  situation  where  you  do  n't  have  the  tools  and  technologies  that  you  need <comma> there  's  no  reason  for  you  to  invest  in  last  generation  's  technologies <period> right <questionmark> that  you  're  much  better  off <comma> almost  universally <comma> looking  for  a  low-cost  or  locally  applicable  version  of  the  newest  technology <period> one  place  we  're  all  familiar  with  seeing  this  is  with  cell  phones <period> right <questionmark> all  throughout  the  developing  world <comma> people  are  going  directly  to  cell  phones <comma> skipping  the  whole  landline  stage <period> if  there  are  landlines  in  many  developing  world  cities <comma> they  're  usually  pretty  crappy  systems  that  break  down  a  lot  and  cost  enormous  amounts  of  money <period> so  i  rather  like  this  picture  here <period> i  particularly  like  the  ganesh  in  the  background <comma> talking  on  the  cell  phone <period> so  what  we  have <comma> increasingly <comma> is  cell  phones  just  permeating  out  through  society <period> we've  heard  all  about  this  here  this  week <comma> so  i  wo  n't  say  too  much  more  than  that <comma> other  than  to  say  what  is  true  for  cell  phones  is  true  for  all  sorts  of  technologies <period> the  second  thing  is  tools  for  collaboration <comma> be  they  systems  of  collaboration <comma> or  intellectual  property  systems  which  encourage  collaboration <period> right <questionmark> when  you  have  free  ability  for  people  to  freely  work  together  and  innovate <comma> you  get  different  kinds  of  solutions <period> and  those  solutions  are  accessible  in  a  different  way  to  people  who  do  n't  have  capital <period> right <questionmark> so <comma> you  know <comma> we  have  open  source  software <comma> we  have  creative  commons  and  other  kinds  of  copyleft  solutions <period> and  those  things  lead  to  things  like  this <period> this  is  a  telecentro  in  sao  paulo <period> this  is  a  pretty  remarkable  program  using  free  and  open  source  software <comma> cheap <comma> sort  of  hacked-together  machines <comma> and  basically  sort  of  abandoned  buildings <comma> has  put  together  a  bunch  of  community  centers  where  people  can  come  in <comma> get  high-speed  internet  access <comma> learn  computer  programming  skills  for  free <period> and  a  quarter-million  people  every  year  use  these  now  in  sao  paulo <period> and  those  quarter-million  people  are  some  of  the  poorest  people  in  sao  paolo <period> i  particularly  like  the  little  linux  penguin  in  the  back <period> so  one  of  the  things  that  that  's  leading  to  is  a  sort  of  southern  cultural  explosion <period> and  one  of  the  things  we  're  really <comma> really  interested  in  at  worldchanging  is  the  ways  in  which  the  south  is  re-identifying  itself <comma> and  re-categorizing  itself  in  ways  that  have  less  and  less  to  do  with  most  of  us  in  this  room <period> so  it  's  not <comma> you  know <comma> bollywood  is  n't  just  answering  hollywood <period> right <questionmark> you  know <comma> brazilian  music  scene  is  n't  just  answering  the  major  labels <period> it  's  doing  something  new <period> there  's  new  things  happening <period> there  's  interplay  between  them <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> you  get  amazing  things <period> like <comma> i  do  n't  know  if  any  of  you  have  seen  the  movie  city  of  god <questionmark> yeah <comma> it  's  a  fabulous  movie  if  you  have  n't  seen  it <period> and  it  's  all  about  this  question <comma> in  a  very  artistic  and  indirect  kind  of  way <period> you  have  other  radical  examples  where  the  ability  to  use  cultural  tools  is  spreading  out <period> these  are  people  who  have  just  been  visited  by  the  internet  bookmobile  in  uganda <period> and  who  are  waving  their  first  books  in  the  air <comma> which <comma> i  just  think  that  's  a  pretty  cool  picture <period> you  know <questionmark> so  you  also  have  the  ability  for  people  to  start  coming  together  and  acting  on  their  own  behalf  in  political  and  civic  ways <period> in  ways  that  have  n't  happened  before <period> and  as  we  heard  last  night <comma> as  we've  heard  earlier  this  week <comma> are  absolutely <comma> fundamentally  vital  to  the  ability  to  craft  new  solutions <comma> is  we've  got  to  craft  new  political  realities <period> and  i  would  personally  say  that  we  have  to  craft  new  political  realities <comma> not  only  in  places  like  india <comma> afghanistan <comma> kenya <comma> pakistan <comma> what  have  you <comma> but  here  at  home  as  well <period> another  world  is  possible <period> and  sort  of  the  big  motto  of  the  anti-globalization  movement <period> right <questionmark> we  tweak  that  a  lot <period> we  talk  about  how  another  world  is  n't  just  possible <period> another  world  's  here <period> that  it  's  not  just  that  we  have  to  sort  of  imagine  there  being  a  different <comma> vague  possibility  out  there <comma> but  we  need  to  start  acting  a  little  bit  more  on  that  possibility <period> we  need  to  start  doing  things  like  lula <comma> president  of  brazil <period> how  many  people  knew  of  lula  before  today <questionmark> ok <comma> so <comma> much <comma> much  better  than  the  average  crowd <comma> i  can  tell  you  that <period> so  lula <comma> he  's  full  of  problems <comma> full  of  contradictions <comma> but  one  of  the  things  that  he  's  doing  is <comma> he  is  putting  forward  an  idea  of  how  we  engage  in  international  relations  that  completely  shifts  the  balance  from  the  standard  sort  of  north-south  dialogue  into  a  whole  new  way  of  global  collaboration <period> i  would  keep  your  eye  on  this  fellow <period> another  example  of  this  sort  of  second  superpower  thing  is  the  rise  of  these  games  that  are  what  we  call  serious  play <period> we  're  looking  a  lot  at  this <period> this  is  spreading  everywhere <period> this  is  from  a  force  more  powerful  it  's  a  little  screenshot <period> a  force  more  powerful  is  a  video  game  that <comma> while  you  're  playing  it <comma> it  teaches  you  how  to  engage  in  non-violent  insurrection  and  regime  change <period> here  's  another  one <period> this  is  from  a  game  called  food  force <comma> which  is  a  game  that  teaches  children  how  to  run  a  refugee  camp <period> these  things  are  all  contributing  in  a  very  dynamic  way  to  a  huge  rise  in <comma> especially  in  the  developing  world <comma> in  people  's  interest  in  and  passion  for  democracy <period> we  get  so  little  news  about  the  developing  world  that  we  often  forget  that  there  are  literally  millions  of  people  out  there  struggling  to  change  things  to  be  fairer <comma> freer <comma> more  democratic <comma> less  corrupt <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> we  do  n't  hear  those  stories  enough <period> but  it  's  happening  all  over  the  place <comma> and  these  tools  are  part  of  what  's  making  it  possible <period> now  when  you  add  all  those  things  together <comma> when  you  add  together  leapfrogging  and  new  kinds  of  tools <comma> you  know <comma> second  superpower  stuff <comma> etc <comma> what  do  you  get <questionmark> well <comma> very  quickly <comma> you  get  a  bright  green  future  for  the  developing  world <period> you  get <comma> for  example <comma> green  power  spread  throughout  the  world <period> you  get <comma> this  is  a  building  in  hyderabad <comma> india <period> it  's  the  greenest  building  in  the  world <period> you  get  grassroots  solutions <comma> things  that  work  for  people  who  have  no  capital  or  limited  access <period> you  get  barefoot  solar  engineers  carrying  solar  panels  into  the  remote  mountains <period> you  get  access  to  distance  medicine <period> these  are  indian  nurses  learning  how  to  use  pdas  to  access  databases  that  have  information  that  they  do  n't  have  access  to  at  home  in  a  distant  manner <period> you  get  new  tools  for  people  in  the  developing  world <period> these  are  led  lights  that  help  the  roughly  billion  people  out  there <comma> for  whom  nightfall  means  darkness <comma> to  have  a  new  means  of  operating <period> these  are  refrigerators  that  require  no  electricity <period> they  're  pot  within  a  pot  design <period> and  you  get  water  solutions <period> water  's  one  of  the  most  pressing  problems <period> here  's  a  design  for  harvesting  rainwater  that  's  super  cheap  and  available  to  people  in  the  developing  world <period> here  's  a  design  for  distilling  water  using  sunlight <period> here  's  a  fog-catcher <comma> which <comma> if  you  live  in  a  moist <comma> jungle-like  area <comma> will  distill  water  from  the  air  that  's  clean  and  drinkable <period> here  's  a  way  of  transporting  water <period> i  just  love  this <comma> you  know <comma> i  mean  carrying  water  is  such  a  drag <comma> and  somebody  just  came  up  with  the  idea  of  well <comma> what  if  you  rolled  it <period> right <questionmark> i  mean <comma> that  's  a  great  design <period> this  is  a  fabulous  invention <comma> lifestraw <period> basically  you  can  suck  any  water  through  this  and  it  will  become  drinkable  by  the  time  it  hits  your  lips <period> so <comma> you  know <comma> people  who  are  in  desperate  straits  can  get  this <period> this  is  one  of  my  favorite  worldchanging  kinds  of  things  ever <period> this  is  a  merry-go-round  invented  by  the  company  roundabout <comma> which  pumps  water  as  kids  play <period> you  know <questionmark> seriously <comma> give  that  one  a  hand <comma> it  's  pretty  great <period> and  the  same  thing  is  true  for  people  who  are  in  absolute  crisis <period> right <questionmark> we  're  expecting  to  have  upwards  of  200  million  refugees  by  the  year  2020  because  of  climate  change  and  political  instability <period> how  do  we  help  people  like  that <questionmark> well <comma> there  's  all  sorts  of  amazing  new  humanitarian  designs  that  are  being  developed  in  collaborative  ways  all  across  the  planet <period> some  of  those  designs  include  models  for  acting <comma> such  as  new  models  for  village  instruction  in  the  middle  of  refugee  camps <period> new  models  for  pedagogy  for  the  displaced <period> and  we  have  new  tools <period> this  is  one  of  my  absolute  favorite  things  anywhere <period> does  anyone  know  what  this  is <questionmark> audience <comma> it  detects  landmines <period> alex  steffen <comma> exactly <comma> this  is  a  landmine-detecting  flower <period> if  you  are  living  in  one  of  the  places  where  the  roughly  half-billion  unaccounted  for  mines  are  scattered <comma> you  can  fling  these  seeds  out  into  the  field <period> and  as  they  grow  up <comma> they  will  grow  up  around  the  mines <comma> their  roots  will  detect  the  chemicals  in  them <comma> and  where  the  flowers  turn  red  you  do  n't  step <period> yeah <comma> so  seeds  that  could  save  your  life <period> you  know <questionmark> i  also  love  it  because  it  seems  to  me  that  the  example <comma> the  tools  we  use  to  change  the  world <comma> ought  to  be  beautiful  in  themselves <period> you  know <comma> that  it  's  not  just  enough  to  survive <period> we've  got  to  make  something  better  than  what  we've  got <period> and  i  think  that  we  will <period> just  to  wrap  up <comma> in  the  immortal  words  of  hg <period> wells <comma> i  think  that  better  things  are  on  the  way <period> i  think  that <comma> in  fact <comma> that  all  of  the  past  is  but  the  beginning  of  a  beginning <period> all  that  the  human  mind  has  accomplished  is  but  the  dream  before  the  awakening <period> i  hope  that  that  turns  out  to  be  true <period> the  people  in  this  room  have  given  me  more  confidence  than  ever  that  it  will <period> thank  you  very  much <period> so  the  awesome  story <comma> it  begins  about  40  years  ago <comma> when  my  mom  and  my  dad  came  to  canada <period> my  mom  left  nairobi <comma> kenya <period> my  dad  left  a  small  village  outside  of  amritsar <comma> india <period> and  they  got  here  in  the  late  1960s <period> they  settled  in  a  shady  suburb  about  an  hour  east  of  toronto <period> and  they  settled  into  a  new  life <period> they  saw  their  first  dentist <comma> they  ate  their  first  hamburger <comma> and  they  had  their  first  kids <period> my  sister  and  i  grew  up  here <comma> and  we  had  quiet <comma> happy  childhoods <period> we  had  close  family <comma> good  friends <comma> a  quiet  street <period> we  grew  up  taking  for  granted  a  lot  of  the  things  that  my  parents  could  n't  take  for  granted  when  they  grew  up <comma> things  like  power  always  on  in  our  houses <comma> things  like  schools  across  the  street  and  hospitals  down  the  road  and  popsicles  in  the  backyard <period> we  grew  up <comma> and  we  grew  older <period> i  went  to  high  school <period> i  graduated <period> i  moved  out  of  the  house <comma> i  got  a  job <comma> i  found  a  girl <comma> i  settled  down <comma> and  i  realize  it  sounds  like  a  bad  sitcom  or  a  cat  stevens  song  -- <period> but  life  was  pretty  good <period> life  was  pretty  good <period> 2006  was  a  great  year <period> under  clear  blue  skies  in  july  in  the  wine  region  of  ontario <comma> i  got  married <comma> surrounded  by  150  family  and  friends <period> 2007  was  a  great  year <period> i  graduated  from  school <comma> and  i  went  on  a  road  trip  with  two  of  my  closest  friends <period> here  's  a  picture  of  me  and  my  friend <comma> chris <comma> on  the  coast  of  the  pacific  ocean <period> we  actually  saw  seals  out  of  our  car  window <comma> and  we  pulled  over  to  take  a  quick  picture  of  them  and  then  blocked  them  with  our  giant  heads <period> so  you  cannot  actually  see  them <comma> but  it  was  breathtaking <comma> believe  me <period> 2008  and  2009  were  a  little  tougher <period> i  know  that  they  were  tougher  for  a  lot  of  people <comma> not  just  me <period> first  of  all <comma> the  news  was  so  heavy <period> it  's  still  heavy  now <comma> and  it  was  heavy  before  that <comma> but  when  you  flipped  open  a  newspaper <comma> when  you  turned  on  the  tv <comma> it  was  about  ice  caps  melting <comma> wars  going  on  around  the  world <comma> earthquakes <comma> hurricanes  and  an  economy  that  was  wobbling  on  the  brink  of  collapse <comma> and  then  eventually  did  collapse <comma> and  so  many  of  us  losing  our  homes <comma> or  our  jobs <comma> or  our  retirements <comma> or  our  livelihoods <period> 2008 <comma> 2009  were  heavy  years  for  me  for  another  reason <comma> too <period> i  was  going  through  a  lot  of  personal  problems  at  the  time <period> my  marriage  was  n't  going  well <comma> and  we  just  were  growing  further  and  further  apart <period> one  day  my  wife  came  home  from  work  and  summoned  the  courage <comma> through  a  lot  of  tears <comma> to  have  a  very  honest  conversation <period> and  she  said <comma> i  do  n't  love  you  anymore <period> and  it  was  one  of  the  most  painful  things  i'd  ever  heard  and  certainly  the  most  heartbreaking  thing  i'd  ever  heard <comma> until  only  a  month  later <comma> when  i  heard  something  even  more  heartbreaking <period> my  friend  chris <comma> who  i  just  showed  you  a  picture  of <comma> had  been  battling  mental  illness  for  some  time <period> and  for  those  of  you  whose  lives  have  been  touched  by  mental  illness <comma> you  know  how  challenging  it  can  be <period> i  spoke  to  him  on  the  phone  at  10:30  pm <period> on  a  sunday  night <period> we  talked  about  the  tv  show  we  watched  that  evening <period> and  monday  morning <comma> i  found  out  that  he  disappeared <period> very  sadly <comma> he  took  his  own  life <period> and  it  was  a  really  heavy  time <period> and  as  these  dark  clouds  were  circling  me <comma> and  i  was  finding  it  really <comma> really  difficult  to  think  of  anything  good <comma> i  said  to  myself  that  i  really  needed  a  way  to  focus  on  the  positive  somehow <period> so  i  came  home  from  work  one  night <comma> and  i  logged  onto  the  computer <comma> and  i  started  up  a  tiny  website  called  1000awesomethingscom <period> i  was  trying  to  remind  myself  of  the  simple <comma> universal <comma> little  pleasures  that  we  all  love <comma> but  we  just  do  n't  talk  about  enough <comma> things  like  waiters  and  waitresses  who  bring  you  free  refills  without  asking <comma> being  the  first  table  to  get  called  up  to  the  dinner  buffet  at  a  wedding <comma> wearing  warm  underwear  from  just  out  of  the  dryer <comma> or  when  cashiers  open  up  a  new  check-out  lane  at  the  grocery  store  and  you  get  to  be  first  in  line <comma> even  if  you  were  last  at  the  other  line <comma> swoop  right  in  there <period> and  slowly  over  time <comma> i  started  putting  myself  in  a  better  mood <period> i  mean <comma> 50,000  blogs  are  started  a  day <period> and  so  my  blog  was  just  one  of  those  50,000 <period> and  nobody  read  it  except  for  my  mom <period> although  i  should  say  that  my  traffic  did  skyrocket  and  go  up  by  100  percent  when  she  forwarded  it  to  my  dad <period> and  then  i  got  excited  when  it  started  getting  tens  of  hits <period> and  then  i  started  getting  excited  when  it  started  getting  dozens  and  then  hundreds  and  then  thousands  and  then  millions <period> it  started  getting  bigger  and  bigger  and  bigger <period> and  then  i  got  a  phone  call <comma> and  the  voice  at  the  other  end  of  the  line  said <comma> you've  just  won  the  best  blog  in  the  world  award <period> i  was  like <comma> that  sounds  totally  fake <period> which  african  country  do  you  want  me  to  wire  all  my  money  to <questionmark> but  it  turns  out <comma> i  jumped  on  a  plane <comma> and  i  ended  up  walking  a  red  carpet  between  sarah  silverman  and  jimmy  fallon  and  martha  stewart <period> and  i  went  onstage  to  accept  a  webby  award  for  best  blog <period> and  the  surprise  and  just  the  amazement  of  that  was  only  overshadowed  by  my  return  to  toronto <comma> when <comma> in  my  inbox <comma> 10  literary  agents  were  waiting  for  me  to  talk  about  putting  this  into  a  book <period> flash-forward  to  the  next  year  and  the  book  of  awesome  has  now  been  number  one  on  the  bestseller  list  for  20  straight  weeks <period> but  look <comma> i  said  i  wanted  to  do  three  things  with  you  today <period> i  said  i  wanted  to  tell  you  the  awesome  story <comma> i  wanted  to  share  with  you  the  three  as  of  awesome <comma> and  i  wanted  to  leave  you  with  a  closing  thought <period> so  let  's  talk  about  those  three  as <period> over  the  last  few  years <comma> i  have  n't  had  that  much  time  to  really  think <period> but  lately  i  have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  step  back  and  ask  myself <comma> what  is  it  over  the  last  few  years  that  helped  me  grow  my  website <comma> but  also  grow  myself <questionmark> and  i've  summarized  those  things <comma> for  me  personally <comma> as  three  as <period> they  are  attitude <comma> awareness  and  authenticity <period> i'd  love  to  just  talk  about  each  one  briefly <period> so  attitude <comma> look <comma> we  're  all  going  to  get  lumps <comma> and  we  're  all  going  to  get  bumps <period> none  of  us  can  predict  the  future <comma> but  we  do  know  one  thing  about  it  and  that  's  that  it  ai  n't  gonna  go  according  to  plan <period> we  will  all  have  high  highs  and  big  days  and  proud  moments  of  smiles  on  graduation  stages <comma> father-daughter  dances  at  weddings  and  healthy  babies  screeching  in  the  delivery  room <comma> but  between  those  high  highs <comma> we  may  also  have  some  lumps  and  some  bumps  too <period> it  's  sad <comma> and  it  's  not  pleasant  to  talk  about <comma> but  your  husband  might  leave  you <comma> your  girlfriend  could  cheat <comma> your  headaches  might  be  more  serious  than  you  thought <comma> or  your  dog  could  get  hit  by  a  car  on  the  street <period> it  's  not  a  happy  thought <comma> but  your  kids  could  get  mixed  up  in  gangs  or  bad  scenes <period> your  mom  could  get  cancer <comma> your  dad  could  get  mean <period> and  there  are  times  in  life  when  you  will  be  tossed  in  the  well <comma> too <comma> with  twists  in  your  stomach  and  with  holes  in  your  heart <period> and  when  that  bad  news  washes  over  you <comma> and  when  that  pain  sponges  and  soaks  in <comma> i  just  really  hope  you  feel  like  you've  always  got  two  choices <period> one <comma> you  can  swirl  and  twirl  and  gloom  and  doom  forever <comma> or  two <comma> you  can  grieve  and  then  face  the  future  with  newly  sober  eyes <period> having  a  great  attitude  is  about  choosing  option  number  two <comma> and  choosing <comma> no  matter  how  difficult  it  is <comma> no  matter  what  pain  hits  you <comma> choosing  to  move  forward  and  move  on  and  take  baby  steps  into  the  future <period> the  second  a  is  awareness <period> i  love  hanging  out  with  three  year-olds <period> i  love  the  way  that  they  see  the  world <comma> because  they  're  seeing  the  world  for  the  first  time <period> i  love  the  way  that  they  can  stare  at  a  bug  crossing  the  sidewalk <period> i  love  the  way  that  they  'll  stare  slack-jawed  at  their  first  baseball  game  with  wide  eyes  and  a  mitt  on  their  hand <comma> soaking  in  the  crack  of  the  bat  and  the  crunch  of  the  peanuts  and  the  smell  of  the  hotdogs <period> i  love  the  way  that  they  'll  spend  hours  picking  dandelions  in  the  backyard  and  putting  them  into  a  nice  centerpiece  for  thanksgiving  dinner <period> i  love  the  way  that  they  see  the  world <comma> because  they  're  seeing  the  world  for  the  first  time <period> having  a  sense  of  awareness  is  just  about  embracing  your  inner  three  year-old <period> because  you  all  used  to  be  three  years  old <period> that  three-year-old  boy  is  still  part  of  you <period> that  three-year-old  girl  is  still  part  of  you <period> they  're  in  there <period> and  being  aware  is  just  about  remembering  that  you  saw  everything  you've  seen  for  the  first  time  once <comma> too <period> so  there  was  a  time  when  it  was  your  first  time  ever  hitting  a  string  of  green  lights  on  the  way  home  from  work <period> there  was  the  first  time  you  walked  by  the  open  door  of  a  bakery  and  smelt  the  bakery  air <comma> or  the  first  time  you  pulled  a  20-dollar  bill  out  of  your  old  jacket  pocket  and  said <comma> found  money <period> the  last  a  is  authenticity <period> and  for  this  one <comma> i  want  to  tell  you  a  quick  story <period> when <comma> on  a  peanut  farm  in  georgia <comma> a  little  baby  boy  named  roosevelt  grier  was  born <period> roosevelt  grier <comma> or  rosey  grier <comma> as  people  used  to  call  him <comma> grew  up  and  grew  into  a  300-pound <comma> six-foot-five  linebacker  in  the  nfl <period> he  's  number  76  in  the  picture <period> here  he  is  pictured  with  the  fearsome  foursome <period> these  were  four  guys  on  the  la <period> rams  in  the  1960s  you  did  not  want  to  go  up  against <period> they  were  tough  football  players  doing  what  they  love <comma> which  was  crushing  skulls  and  separating  shoulders  on  the  football  field <period> but  rosey  grier  also  had  another  passion <period> in  his  deeply  authentic  self <comma> he  also  loved  needlepoint <period> he  loved  knitting <period> he  said  that  it  calmed  him  down <comma> it  relaxed  him <comma> it  took  away  his  fear  of  flying  and  helped  him  meet  chicks <period> that  's  what  he  said <period> i  mean <comma> he  loved  it  so  much  that <comma> after  he  retired  from  the  nfl <comma> he  started  joining  clubs <period> and  he  even  put  out  a  book  called  rosey  grier  's  needlepoint  for  men <period> it  's  a  great  cover <period> if  you  notice <comma> he  's  actually  needlepointing  his  own  face <period> and  so  what  i  love  about  this  story  is  that  rosey  grier  is  just  such  an  authentic  person <period> and  that  's  what  authenticity  is  all  about <period> it  's  just  about  being  you  and  being  cool  with  that <period> and  i  think  when  you  're  authentic <comma> you  end  up  following  your  heart <comma> and  you  put  yourself  in  places  and  situations  and  in  conversations  that  you  love  and  that  you  enjoy <period> you  meet  people  that  you  like  talking  to <period> you  go  places  you've  dreamt  about <period> and  you  end  you  end  up  following  your  heart  and  feeling  very  fulfilled <period> so  those  are  the  three  a  's <period> for  the  closing  thought <comma> i  want  to  take  you  all  the  way  back  to  my  parents  coming  to  canada <period> i  do  n't  know  what  it  would  feel  like  coming  to  a  new  country  when  you  're  in  your  mid-20s <period> i  do  n't  know <comma> because  i  never  did  it <period> but  i  would  imagine  that  it  would  take  a  great  attitude <period> i  would  imagine  that  you'd  have  to  be  pretty  aware  of  your  surroundings  and  appreciating  the  small  wonders  that  you  're  starting  to  see  in  your  new  world <period> and  i  think  you'd  have  to  be  really  authentic <comma> you'd  have  to  be  really  true  to  yourself  in  order  to  get  through  what  you  're  being  exposed  to <period> i'd  like  to  pause  my  tedtalk  for  about  10  seconds  right  now <comma> because  you  do  n't  get  many  opportunities  in  life  to  do  something  like  this <comma> and  my  parents  are  sitting  in  the  front  row <period> so  i  wanted  to  ask  them  to <comma> if  they  do  n't  mind <comma> stand  up <period> and  i  just  wanted  to  say  thank  you  to  you  guys <period> when  i  was  growing  up <comma> my  dad  used  to  love  telling  the  story  of  his  first  day  in  canada <period> and  it  's  a  great  story <comma> because  what  happened  was  he  got  off  the  plane  at  the  toronto  airport <comma> and  he  was  welcomed  by  a  non-profit  group <comma> which  i  'm  sure  someone  in  this  room  runs <period> and  this  non-profit  group  had  a  big  welcoming  lunch  for  all  the  new  immigrants  to  canada <period> and  my  dad  says  he  got  off  the  plane  and  he  went  to  this  lunch  and  there  was  this  huge  spread <period> there  was  bread <comma> there  was  those  little <comma> mini  dill  pickles <comma> there  was  olives <comma> those  little  white  onions <period> there  was  rolled  up  turkey  cold  cuts <comma> rolled  up  ham  cold  cuts <comma> rolled  up  roast  beef  cold  cuts  and  little  cubes  of  cheese <period> there  was  tuna  salad  sandwiches  and  egg  salad  sandwiches  and  salmon  salad  sandwiches <period> there  was  lasagna <comma> there  was  casseroles <comma> there  was  brownies <comma> there  was  butter  tarts <comma> and  there  was  pies <comma> lots  and  lots  of  pies <period> and  when  my  dad  tells  the  story <comma> he  says <comma> the  craziest  thing  was <comma> i'd  never  seen  any  of  that  before <comma> except  bread <period> i  did  n't  know  what  was  meat <comma> what  was  vegetarian <period> i  was  eating  olives  with  pie <period> i  just  could  n't  believe  how  many  things  you  can  get  here <period> when  i  was  five  years  old <comma> my  dad  used  to  take  me  grocery  shopping <period> and  he  would  stare  in  wonder  at  the  little  stickers  that  are  on  the  fruits  and  vegetables <period> he  would  say <comma> look <comma> can  you  believe  they  have  a  mango  here  from  mexico <questionmark> they've  got  an  apple  here  from  south  africa <period> can  you  believe  they've  got  a  date  from  morocco <questionmark> he  's  like <comma> do  you  know  where  morocco  even  is <questionmark> and  i'd  say <comma> i  'm  five <period> i  do  n't  even  know  where  i  am <period> is  this  a&ampp <questionmark> and  he'd  say <comma> i  do  n't  know  where  morocco  is  either <comma> but  let  's  find  out <period> and  so  we'd  buy  the  date <comma> and  we'd  go  home <period> and  we'd  actually  take  an  atlas  off  the  shelf <comma> and  we'd  flip  through  until  we  found  this  mysterious  country <period> and  when  we  did <comma> my  dad  would  say <comma> can  you  believe  someone  climbed  a  tree  over  there <comma> picked  this  thing  off  it <comma> put  it  in  a  truck <comma> drove  it  all  the  way  to  the  docks  and  then  sailed  it  all  the  way  across  the  atlantic  ocean  and  then  put  it  in  another  truck  and  drove  that  all  the  way  to  a  tiny  grocery  store  just  outside  our  house <comma> so  they  could  sell  it  to  us  for  25  cents <questionmark> and  i'd  say <comma> i  do  n't  believe  that <period> and  he  's  like <comma> i  do  n't  believe  it  either <period> things  are  amazing <period> there  's  just  so  many  things  to  be  happy  about <period> when  i  stop  to  think  about  it <comma> he  's  absolutely  right <period> there  are  so  many  things  to  be  happy  about <period> we  are  the  only  species  on  the  only  life-giving  rock  in  the  entire  universe  that  we've  ever  seen <comma> capable  of  experiencing  so  many  of  these  things <period> i  mean <comma> we  're  the  only  ones  with  architecture  and  agriculture <period> we  're  the  only  ones  with  jewelry  and  democracy <period> we've  got  airplanes <comma> highway  lanes <comma> interior  design  and  horoscope  signs <period> we've  got  fashion  magazines <comma> house  party  scenes <period> you  can  watch  a  horror  movie  with  monsters <period> you  can  go  to  a  concert  and  hear  guitars  jamming <period> we've  got  books <comma> buffets  and  radio  waves <comma> wedding  brides  and  rollercoaster  rides <period> you  can  sleep  in  clean  sheets <period> you  can  go  to  the  movies  and  get  good  seats <period> you  can  smell  bakery  air <comma> walk  around  with  rain  hair <comma> pop  bubble  wrap  or  take  an  illegal  nap <period> we've  got  all  that <comma> but  we've  only  got  100  years  to  enjoy  it <period> and  that  's  the  sad  part <period> the  cashiers  at  your  grocery  store <comma> the  foreman  at  your  plant <comma> the  guy  tailgating  you  home  on  the  highway <comma> the  telemarketer  calling  you  during  dinner <comma> every  teacher  you've  ever  had <comma> everyone  that  's  ever  woken  up  beside  you <comma> every  politician  in  every  country <comma> every  actor  in  every  movie <comma> every  single  person  in  your  family <comma> everyone  you  love <comma> everyone  in  this  room  and  you  will  be  dead  in  a  hundred  years <period> life  is  so  great  that  we  only  get  such  a  short  time  to  experience  and  enjoy  all  those  tiny  little  moments  that  make  it  so  sweet <period> and  that  moment  is  right  now <comma> and  those  moments  are  counting  down <comma> and  those  moments  are  always <comma> always <comma> always  fleeting <period> you  will  never  be  as  young  as  you  are  right  now <period> and  that  's  why  i  believe  that  if  you  live  your  life  with  a  great  attitude <comma> choosing  to  move  forward  and  move  on  whenever  life  deals  you  a  blow <comma> living  with  a  sense  of  awareness  of  the  world  around  you <comma> embracing  your  inner  three  year-old  and  seeing  the  tiny  joys  that  make  life  so  sweet  and  being  authentic  to  yourself <comma> being  you  and  being  cool  with  that <comma> letting  your  heart  lead  you  and  putting  yourself  in  experiences  that  satisfy  you <comma> then  i  think  you  'll  live  a  life  that  is  rich  and  is  satisfying <comma> and  i  think  you  'll  live  a  life  that  is  truly  awesome <period> thank  you <period> as  a  researcher <comma> every  once  in  a  while  you  encounter  something  a  little  disconcerting <period> and  this  is  something  that  changes  your  understanding  of  the  world  around  you <comma> and  teaches  you  that  you  're  very  wrong  about  something  that  you  really  believed  firmly  in <period> and  these  are  unfortunate  moments <comma> because  you  go  to  sleep  that  night  dumber  than  when  you  woke  up <period> so <comma> that  's  really  the  goal  of  my  talk <comma> is  to  a <comma> communicate  that  moment  to  you  and  b <comma> have  you  leave  this  session  a  little  dumber  than  when  you  entered <period> so <comma> i  hope  i  can  really  accomplish  that <period> so <comma> this  incident  that  i  'm  going  to  describe  really  began  with  some  diarrhea <period> now <comma> we've  known  for  a  long  time  the  cause  of  diarrhea <period> that  's  why  there  's  a  glass  of  water  up  there <period> for  us <comma> it  's  a  problem <comma> the  people  in  this  room <period> for  babies <comma> it  's  deadly <period> they  lack  nutrients <comma> and  diarrhea  dehydrates  them <period> and  so <comma> as  a  result <comma> there  is  a  lot  of  death <comma> a  lot  of  death <period> in  india  in  1960 <comma> there  was  a  24  percent  child  mortality  rate <comma> lots  of  people  did  n't  make  it <period> this  is  incredibly  unfortunate <period> one  of  the  big  reasons  this  happened  was  because  of  diarrhea <period> now <comma> there  was  a  big  effort  to  solve  this  problem <period> and  there  was  actually  a  big  solution <period> this  solution  has  been  called <comma> by  some <comma> potentially  the  most  important  medical  advance  this  century <period> now <comma> the  solution  turned  out  to  be  simple <period> and  what  it  was  was  oral  rehydration  salts <period> many  of  you  have  probably  used  this <period> it  's  brilliant <period> it  's  a  way  to  get  sodium  and  glucose  together  so  that  when  you  add  it  to  water  the  child  is  able  to  absorb  it  even  during  situations  of  diarrhea <period> remarkable  impact  on  mortality <period> massive  solution  to  the  problem <period> flash  forward <comma> 1960 <comma> 24  percent  child  mortality  has  dropped  to  65  percent  today <period> still  a  big  number <comma> but  a  big  drop <period> it  looks  like  the  technological  problem  is  solved <period> but  if  you  look <comma> even  today  there  are  about  400,000  diarrhea-related  deaths  in  india  alone <period> what  's  going  on  here <questionmark> well  the  easy  answer  is <comma> we  just  have  n't  gotten  those  salts  to  those  people <period> that  's  actually  not  true <period> if  you  look  in  areas  where  these  salts  are  completely  available <comma> the  price  is  low  or  zero <comma> these  deaths  still  continue  abated <period> maybe  there  's  a  biological  answer <period> maybe  these  are  the  deaths  that  simple  rehydration  alone  does  n't  solve <period> that  's  not  true  either <period> many  of  these  deaths  were  completely  preventable <period> and  this  what  i  want  to  think  of  as  the  disconcerting  thing <comma> what  i  want  to  call  the  last  mile  problem <period> see <comma> we  spent  a  lot  of  energy <comma> in  many  domains  -- <period> technological <comma> scientific <comma> hard  work <comma> creativity <comma> human  ingenuity <comma> to  crack  important  social  problems  with  technology  solutions <period> that  's  been  the  discoveries  of  the  last  2,000  years <period> that  's  mankind  moving  forward <period> but  in  this  case  we  cracked  it <comma> but  a  big  part  of  the  problem  still  remains <period> nine  hundred  and  ninety-nine  miles  went  well <period> the  last  mile  's  proving  incredibly  stubborn <period> now <comma> that  's  for  oral  rehydration  therapy <period> maybe  this  is  something  unique  about  diarrhea <period> well <comma> it  turns  out <comma> and  this  is  where  things  get  really  disconcerting <comma> it  's  not  unique  to  diarrhea <period> it  's  not  even  unique  to  poor  people  in  india <period> here  's  an  example  from  a  variety  of  contexts <period> i've  put  a  bunch  of  examples  up  here <period> i  'll  start  with  insulin <comma> diabetes  medication  in  the  us <period> ok <comma> the  american  population <period> on  medicaid <comma> if  you  're  fairly  poor  you  get  medicaid <comma> or  if  you  have  health  insurance <comma> insulin  is  pretty  straightforward <period> you  get  it <comma> either  in  pill  form  or  you  get  it  as  an  injection <period> you  have  to  take  it  every  day  to  maintain  your  blood  sugar  levels <period> massive  technological  advance <comma> took  an  incredibly  deadly  disease <comma> made  it  solvable <period> adherence  rates <period> how  many  people  are  taking  their  insulin  every  day <questionmark> about  on  average <comma> a  typical  person  is  taking  it  75  percent  of  the  time <period> as  a  result <comma> 25,000  people  a  year  go  blind <comma> hundreds  of  thousands  lose  limbs <comma> every  year <comma> for  something  that  's  solvable <period> here  i  have  a  bunch  of  other  examples <comma> all  suffer  from  the  last  mile  problem <period> it  's  not  just  medicine <period> here  's  another  example  from  technology: <period> agriculture <period> we  think  there  's  a  food  problem <comma> so  we  create  new  seeds <period> we  think  there  's  an  income  problem <comma> so  we  create  new  ways  of  farming  that  increase  income <period> well <comma> look  at  some  old  ways <comma> some  ways  that  we'd  already  cracked <period> intercropping <period> intercropping  really  increases  income <period> sometimes  in  rice  we  found  incredible  increases  in  yield  when  you  mix  different  varieties  of  rice  side  by  side <period> some  people  are  doing  that <comma> many  are  not <period> what  's  going  on <questionmark> this  is  the  last  mile <period> the  last  mile  is <comma> everywhere <comma> problematic <period> alright <comma> what  's  the  problem <questionmark> the  problem  is  this  little  three-pound  machine  that  's  behind  your  eyes  and  between  your  ears <period> this  machine  is  really  strange <comma> and  one  of  the  consequences  is  that  people  are  weird <period> they  do  lots  of  inconsistent  things <period> they  do  lots  of  inconsistent  things <period> and  the  inconsistencies  create <comma> fundamentally <comma> this  last  mile  problem <period> see <comma> when  we  were  dealing  with  our  biology <comma> bacteria <comma> the  genes <comma> the  things  inside  here <comma> the  blood <questionmark> that  's  complex <comma> but  it  's  manageable <period> when  we  're  dealing  with  people  like  this <questionmark> the  mind  is  more  complex <period> that  's  not  as  manageable <comma> and  that  's  what  we  're  struggling  with <period> let  me  go  back  to  diarrhea  for  a  second <period> here  's  a  question  that  was  asked  in  the  national  sample  survey <comma> which  is  a  survey  asked  of  many  indian  women: <period> your  child  has  diarrhea <period> should  you  increase <comma> maintain  or  decrease  the  number  of  fluids <questionmark> just  so  you  do  n't  embarrass  yourselves <comma> i  'll  give  you  the  right  answer: <period> it  's  increase <period> now <comma> diarrhea  's  interesting  because  it  's  been  around  for  thousands  of  years <comma> ever  since  humankind  really  lived  side  by  side  enough  to  have  really  polluted  water <period> one  roman  strategy  that  was  very  interesting  was  that <comma> and  it  really  gave  them  a  comparative  advantage <comma> they  made  sure  their  soldiers  did  n't  drink  even  remotely  muddied  waters <period> because  if  some  of  your  troops  get  diarrhea  they  're  not  that  effective  on  the  battlefield <period> so <comma> if  you  think  of  roman  comparative  advantage  part  of  it  was  the  breast  shields <comma> the  breastplates <comma> but  part  of  it  was  drinking  the  right  water <period> so <comma> here  are  these  women <period> they've  seen  their  parents  have  struggled  with  diarrhea <comma> they've  struggled  with  diarrhea <period> they've  seen  lots  of  deaths <period> how  do  they  answer  this  question <questionmark> in  india <comma> 35  to  50  percent  say  reduce <period> think  about  what  that  means  for  a  second <period> thirty-five  to  50  percent  of  women  forget  oral  rehydration  therapy <comma> they  are  increasing <comma> they  are  actually  making  their  child  more  likely  to  die  through  their  actions <period> how  is  that  possible <questionmark> well <comma> one  possibility <comma> i  think  that  's  how  most  people  respond  to  this <comma> is  to  say <comma> that  's  just  stupid <period> i  do  n't  think  that  's  stupid <period> i  think  there  is  something  very  profoundly  right  in  what  these  women  are  doing <period> and  that  is <comma> you  do  n't  put  water  into  a  leaky  bucket <period> so <comma> think  of  the  mental  model  that  goes  behind  reducing  the  intake <period> just  does  n't  make  sense <period> now <comma> the  model  is  intuitively  right <period> it  just  does  n't  happen  to  be  right  about  the  world <period> but  it  makes  a  whole  lot  of  sense  at  some  deep  level <period> and  that <comma> to  me <comma> is  the  fundamental  challenge  of  the  last  mile <period> this  first  challenge  is  what  i  refer  to  as  the  persuasion  challenge <period> convincing  people  to  do  something <comma> take  oral  rehydration  therapy <comma> intercrop <comma> whatever  it  might  be <comma> is  not  an  act  of  information: <period> let  's  give  them  the  data <comma> and  when  they  have  data  they  'll  do  the  right  thing <period> it  's  more  complex  than  that <period> and  if  you  want  to  understand  how  it  's  more  complex  let  me  start  with  something  kind  of  interesting <period> i  'm  going  to  give  you  a  little  math  problem <period> and  i  want  you  to  just  yell  out  the  answer  as  fast  as  possible <period> a  bat  and  a  ball  together  cost  $110 <period> the  bat  costs  a  dollar  more  than  the  ball <period> how  much  does  the  ball  cost <questionmark> quick <period> so <comma> somebody  out  there  says <comma> five <period> a  lot  of  you  said <comma> ten <period> let  's  think  about  10  for  a  second <period> if  the  ball  costs  10 <comma> the  bat  costs <period> this  is  easy <comma> $110 <period> yeah <period> so <comma> together  they  would  cost  $120 <period> so <comma> here  you  all  are <comma> ostensibly  educated  people <period> most  of  you  look  smart <period> the  combination  of  that  produces  something  that  is  actually <comma> you  got  this  thing  wrong <period> how  is  that  possible <questionmark> let  's  go  to  something  else <period> i  know  algebra  can  be  complicated <period> so <comma> let  's  dial  this  back <period> that  's  what <questionmark> fifth  grade <questionmark> fourth  grade <questionmark> let  's  go  back  to  kindergarten <period> ok <questionmark> there  's  a  great  show  on  american  television  that  you  have  to  watch <period> it  's  called  are  you  smarter  than  a  fifth  grader <questionmark> i  think  we've  learned  the  answer  to  that  here <period> let  's  move  to  kindergarten <period> let  's  see  if  we  can  beat  five-year-olds <period> here  's  what  i  'm  going  to  do <comma> i  'm  going  to  put  objects  on  the  screen <period> i  just  want  you  to  name  the  color  of  the  object <period> that  's  all  it  is <period> ok <questionmark> i  want  you  to  do  it  fast <comma> and  say  it  out  loud  with  me <period> and  do  it  quickly <period> i  'll  make  the  first  one  easy  for  you <period> ready <questionmark> black <period> now  the  next  ones  i  want  you  to  do  quickly  and  say  it  out  loud <period> ready <questionmark> go <period> audience <comma> red <period> green <period> yellow <period> blue <period> red <period> sendhil  mullainathan <comma> that  's  pretty  good <period> almost  out  of  kindergarten <period> what  is  all  this  telling  us <questionmark> you  see <comma> what  's  going  on  here <comma> and  in  the  bat  and  ball  problem  is  that  you  have  some  intuitive  ways  of  interacting  with  the  world <comma> some  models  that  you  use  to  understand  the  world <period> these  models <comma> like  the  leaky  bucket <comma> work  well  in  most  situations <period> i  suspect  most  of  you <comma> i  hope  that  's  true  for  the  rest  of  you <comma> actually  do  pretty  well  with  addition  and  subtraction  in  the  real  world <period> i  found  a  problem <comma> a  specific  problem  that  actually  found  an  error  with  that <period> diarrhea <comma> and  many  last  mile  problems <comma> are  like  that <period> they  are  situations  where  the  mental  model  does  n't  match  the  reality <period> same  thing  here <comma> you  had  an  intuitive  response  to  this  that  was  very  quick <period> you  read  blue  and  you  wanted  to  say  blue <comma> even  though  you  knew  your  task  was  red <period> now <comma> i  do  this  stuff  because  it  's  fun <period> but  it  's  more  profound  than  fun <period> i  'll  give  you  a  good  example  of  how  it  actually  effects  persuasion <period> bmw  is  a  pretty  safe  car <period> and  they  are  trying  to  figure  out <comma> safety  is  good <period> i  want  to  advertise  safety <period> how  am  i  going  to  advertise  safety <questionmark> i  could  give  people  numbers <period> we  do  well  on  crash  tests <period> but  the  truth  of  the  matter  is <comma> you  look  at  that  car <comma> it  does  n't  look  like  a  volvo <period> and  it  does  n't  look  like  a  hummer <period> so <comma> what  i  want  you  to  think  about  for  a  few  minutes  is <comma> how  would  you  convey  safety  of  the  bmw <questionmark> okay <questionmark> so  now <comma> while  you  're  thinking  about  that  let  's  move  to  a  second  task <period> the  second  task  is  fuel  efficiency <period> okay <questionmark> here  's  another  puzzle  for  all  of  you <period> one  person  walks  into  a  car  lot <comma> and  they  're  thinking  about  buying  this  toyota  yaris <period> they  are  saying <comma> this  is  35  miles  per  gallon <period> i  'm  going  to  do  the  environmentally  right  thing <comma> i  'm  going  to  buy  the  prius <comma> another  person  walks  into  the  lot <period> and  they  're  about  to  buy  a  hummer <comma> nine  miles  per  gallon <comma> fully  loaded <comma> luxury <period> and  they  say <comma> you  know  what <questionmark> do  i  need  turbo <questionmark> do  i  need  this  heavyweight  car <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  do  something  good  for  the  environment <period> i  'm  going  to  take  off  some  of  that  weight <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  buy  a  hummer  that  's  11  miles  per  gallon  which  one  of  these  people  has  done  more  for  the  environment <questionmark> see <comma> you  have  a  mental  model <period> fifty  versus  35 <comma> that  's  a  big  move <period> eleven  versus  nine <questionmark> come  on <period> turns  out <comma> go  home  and  do  the  math <comma> the  nine  to  11  is  a  bigger  change <period> that  person  has  saved  more  gallons <period> why <questionmark> because  we  do  n't  care  about  miles  per  gallon <comma> we  care  about  gallons  per  mile <period> think  about  how  powerful  that  is  if  you  're  trying  to  encourage  fuel  efficiency <period> miles  per  gallon  is  the  way  we  present  things <period> if  we  want  to  encourage  change  of  behavior <comma> gallons  per  mile  would  have  far  more  effectiveness <period> researchers  have  found  these  type  of  anomalies <period> okay <comma> back  to  bmw <period> what  should  they  do <questionmark> the  problem  bmw  faces  is  this  car  looks  safe <period> this  car <comma> which  is  my  mini <comma> does  n't  look  that  safe <period> here  was  bmw  's  brilliant  insight <comma> which  they  embodied  into  an  ad  campaign <period> they  showed  a  bmw  driving  down  the  street <period> there  's  a  truck  on  the  right <period> boxes  fall  out  of  the  truck <period> the  car  swerves  to  avoid  it <comma> and  therefore  does  n't  get  into  an  accident <period> bwm  realizes  safety <comma> in  people  's  minds <comma> has  two  components <period> you  can  be  safe  because  when  you  're  hit <comma> you  survive <comma> or  you  can  be  safe  because  you  avoid  accidents <period> remarkably  successful  campaign <comma> but  notice  the  power  of  it <period> it  harnesses  something  you  already  believe <period> now <comma> even  if  i  persuaded  you  to  do  something <comma> it  's  hard  sometimes  to  actually  get  action  as  a  result <period> you  all  probably  intended  to  wake  up <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> 6:30 <comma> 7  am <period> this  is  a  battle  we  all  fight  every  day <comma> along  with  trying  to  get  to  the  gym <period> now <comma> this  is  an  example  of  that  battle <comma> and  makes  us  realize  intentions  do  n't  always  translate  into  action <comma> and  so  one  of  the  fundamental  challenges  is  how  we  would  actually  do  that <period> ok <questionmark> so <comma> let  me  now  talk  about  the  last  mile  problem <period> so  far <comma> i've  been  pretty  negative <period> i've  been  trying  to  show  you  the  oddities  of  human  behavior <period> and  i  think  maybe  i  'm  being  too  negative <period> maybe  it  's  the  diarrhea <period> maybe  the  last  mile  problem  really  should  be  thought  of  as  the  last  mile  opportunity <period> let  's  go  back  to  diabetes <period> this  is  a  typical  insulin  injection <period> now <comma> carrying  this  thing  around  is  complicated <period> you  gotta  carry  the  bottle <comma> you  gotta  carry  the  syringe <period> it  's  also  painful <period> now <comma> you  may  think  to  yourself <comma> well <comma> if  my  eyes  depended  on  it <comma> you  know <comma> i  would  obviously  use  it  every  day  but  the  pain <comma> the  discomfort <comma> you  know <comma> paying  attention <comma> remembering  to  put  it  in  your  purse  when  you  go  on  a  long  trip <comma> these  are  the  day-to-day  of  life <comma> and  they  do  pose  problems <period> here  is  an  innovation <comma> a  design  innovation <period> this  is  a  pen <comma> it  's  called  an  insulin  pen <comma> preloaded <period> the  needle  is  particularly  sharp <period> you  just  gotta  carry  this  thing  around <period> it  's  much  easier  to  use <comma> much  less  painful <period> anywhere  between  five  and  10  percent  increase  in  adherence <comma> just  as  a  result  of  this <period> that  's  what  i  'm  talking  about  as  a  last  mile  opportunity <period> you  see <comma> we  tend  to  think  the  problem  is  solved  when  we  solve  the  technology  problem <period> but  the  human  innovation <comma> the  human  problem  still  remains <comma> and  that  's  a  great  frontier  that  we  have  left <period> this  is  n't  about  the  biology  of  people <period> this  is  now  about  the  brains <comma> the  psychology  of  people <period> and  innovation  needs  to  continue  all  the  way  through  the  last  mile <period> here  's  another  example  of  this <period> this  is  from  a  company  called  positive  energy <period> this  is  about  energy  efficiency <period> we  're  spending  a  lot  of  time  on  fuel  cells  right  now <period> what  this  company  does  is  they  send  a  letter  to  households  that  say <comma> here  's  your  energy  use <comma> here  's  your  neighbor  's  energy  use <comma> you  're  doing  well  smiley  face <period> you  're  doing  worse  frown <period> and  what  they  find  is  just  this  letter <comma> nothing  else <comma> has  a  two  to  three  percent  reduction  in  electricity  use <period> and  you  want  to  think  about  the  social  value  of  that  in  terms  of  carbon  offsets <comma> reduced  electricity <comma> 900  million  dollars  per  year <period> why <questionmark> because  for  free <comma> this  is  n't  a  new  technology <comma> this  is  a  letter <comma> we  're  getting  a  big  bang  in  behavior <period> so <comma> how  do  we  tackle  the  last  mile <questionmark> i  think  this  tells  us  there  is  an  opportunity <period> and  i  think  to  tackle  it <comma> we  need  to  combine  psychology <comma> marketing <comma> art <comma> we've  seen  that <period> but  you  know  what  we  need  to  combine  it  with <questionmark> we  need  to  combine  this  with  the  scientific  method <period> see  what  's  really  puzzling  and  frustrating  about  the  last  mile <comma> to  me <comma> is  that  the  first  999  miles  are  all  about  science <period> no  one  would  say <comma> hey <comma> i  think  this  medicine  works <comma> go  ahead  and  use  it <period> we  have  testing <comma> we  go  to  the  lab <comma> we  try  it  again <comma> we  have  refinement <period> but  you  know  what  we  do  on  the  last  mile <questionmark> oh <comma> this  is  a  good  idea <period> people  will  like  this <period> let  's  put  it  out  there <period> the  amount  of  resources  we  put  in  are  disparate <period> we  put  billions  of  dollars  into  fuel-efficient  technologies <period> how  much  are  we  putting  into  energy  behavior  change  in  a  credible <comma> systematic <comma> testing  way <questionmark> now <comma> i  think  that  we  're  on  the  verge  of  something  big <period> we  're  on  the  verge  of  a  whole  new  social  science <period> it  's  a  social  science  that  recognizes <comma> much  like  science  recognizes  the  complexity  of  the  body <comma> biology  recognizes  the  complexity  of  the  body <comma> we  'll  recognize  the  complexity  of  the  human  mind <period> the  careful  testing <comma> retesting <comma> design <period> are  going  to  open  up  vistas  of  understanding <comma> complexities <comma> difficult  things <period> and  those  vistas  will  both  create  new  science <comma> and  fundamental  change  in  the  world  as  we  see  it <comma> in  the  next  hundred  years <period> all  right <period> thank  you  very  much <period> chris  anderson <comma> sendhil <comma> thank  you  so  much <period> so <comma> this  whole  area  is  so  fascinating <period> i  mean <comma> it  sometimes  feels <comma> listening  to  behavioral  economists  that  they  are  kind  of  putting  into  place  academically <comma> what  great  marketers  have  sort  of  intuitively  known  for  a  long  time <period> how  much  is  your  field  talking  to  great  marketers  about  their  insights  into  human  psychology <questionmark> because  they've  seen  it  on  the  ground <period> sendhil  mullainathan <comma> yeah <comma> we  spend  a  lot  of  time  talking  to  marketers <period> and  i  think  60  percent  of  it  is  exactly  what  you  say <comma> there  are  insights  to  be  gleaned  there <period> forty  percent  of  it  is  about  what  marketing  is <period> marketing  is  selling  an  ad  to  a  firm <period> so <comma> in  some  sense <comma> a  lot  of  marketing  is  about  convincing  a  ceo <comma> this  is  a  good  ad  campaign <period> so <comma> there  is  a  little  bit  of  slippage  there <period> that  's  just  a  caveat <period> that  's  different  from  actually  having  an  effective  ad  campaign <period> and  one  of  the  new  movements  in  marketing  is <comma> how  do  we  actually  measure  effectiveness <questionmark> are  we  effective <questionmark> ca <comma> how  you  take  your  insights  here  and  actually  get  them  integrated  into  working  business  models  on  the  ground <comma> in  indian  villages <comma> for  example <questionmark> sm <comma> so <comma> the  scientific  method  i  alluded  to  is  pretty  important <period> we  work  closely  with  companies  that  have  operational  capacity <comma> or  nonprofits  that  have  operational  capacity <period> and  then  we  say <comma> well <comma> you  want  to  get  this  behavior  change <period> let  's  come  up  with  a  few  ideas <comma> test  them <comma> see  which  is  working <comma> go  back <comma> synthesize <comma> and  try  to  come  up  with  a  thing  that  works <comma> and  then  we  're  able  to  scale  with  partners <period> it  's  kind  of  the  model  that  has  worked  in  other  contexts <period> if  you  have  biological  problems  we  try  and  fix  it <comma> see  if  it  works <comma> and  then  work  the  scale <period> ca <comma> alright  sendhil <comma> thanks  so  much  for  coming  to  ted <period> thank  you <period> as  a  culture <comma> we  tell  ourselves  lots  of  stories  about  the  future <comma> and  where  we  might  move  forward  from  this  point <period> some  of  those  stories  are  that  somebody  is  just  going  to  sort  everything  out  for  us <period> other  stories  are  that  everything  is  on  the  verge  of  unraveling <period> but  i  want  to  tell  you  a  different  story  here  today <period> like  all  stories <comma> it  has  a  beginning <period> my  work <comma> for  a  long  time <comma> has  been  involved  in  education <comma> in  teaching  people  practical  skills  for  sustainability <period> teaching  people  how  to  take  responsibility  for  growing  some  of  their  own  food <comma> how  to  build  buildings  using  local  materials <comma> how  to  generate  their  own  energy <comma> and  so  on <period> i  lived  in  ireland <comma> built  the  first  straw-bale  houses  in  ireland <comma> and  some  cob  buildings  and  all  this  kind  of  thing <period> but  all  my  work  for  many  years  was  focused  around  the  idea  that  sustainability  means  basically  looking  at  the  globalized  economic  growth  model <comma> and  moderating  what  comes  in  at  one  end <comma> and  moderating  the  outputs  at  the  other  end <period> and  then  i  came  into  contact  with  a  way  of  looking  at  things  which  actually  changed  that  profoundly <period> and  in  order  to  introduce  you  to  that <comma> i've  got  something  here  that  i  'm  going  to  unveil <period> which  is  one  of  the  great  marvels  of  the  modern  age <period> and  it  's  something  so  astounding  and  so  astonishing  that  i  think  maybe  as  i  remove  this  cloth  a  suitable  gasp  of  amazement  might  be  appropriate <period> if  you  could  help  me  with  that  it  would  be  fantastic <period> this  is  a  liter  of  oil <period> this  bottle  of  oil <comma> distilled  over  a  hundred  million  years  of  geological  time <comma> ancient  sunlight <comma> contains  the  energy  equivalent  of  about  five  weeks  hard  human  manual  labor <comma> equivalent  to  about  35  strong  people  coming  round  and  working  for  you <period> we  can  turn  it  into  a  dazzling  array  of  materials <comma> medicine <comma> modern  clothing <comma> laptops <comma> a  whole  range  of  different  things <period> it  gives  us  an  energy  return  that  's  unimaginable <comma> historically <period> we've  based  the  design  of  our  settlements <comma> our  business  models <comma> our  transport  plans <comma> even  the  idea  of  economic  growth <comma> some  would  argue <comma> on  the  assumption  that  we  will  have  this  in  perpetuity <period> yet <comma> when  we  take  a  step  back <comma> and  look  over  the  span  of  history <comma> at  what  we  might  call  the  petroleum  interval <comma> it  's  a  short  period  in  history  where  we've  discovered  this  extraordinary  material <comma> and  then  based  a  whole  way  of  life  around  it <period> but  as  we  straddle  the  top  of  this  energy  mountain <comma> at  this  stage <comma> we  move  from  a  time  where  our  economic  success <comma> our  sense  of  individual  prowess  and  well-being  is  directly  linked  to  how  much  of  this  we  consume <comma> to  a  time  when  actually  our  degree  of  oil  dependency  is  our  degree  of  vulnerability <period> and  it  's  increasingly  clear  that  we  are  n't  going  to  be  able  to  rely  on  the  fact  that  we  're  going  to  have  this  at  our  disposal  forever <period> for  every  four  barrels  of  oil  that  we  consume <comma> we  only  discover  one <period> and  that  gap  continues  to  widen <period> there  is  also  the  fact  that  the  amount  of  energy  that  we  get  back  from  the  oil  that  we  discover  is  falling <period> in  the  1930s  we  got  100  units  of  energy  back  for  every  one  that  we  put  in  to  extract  it <period> completely  unprecedented <comma> historically <period> already  that  's  fallen  to  about  11 <period> and  that  's  why <comma> now <comma> the  new  breakthroughs <comma> the  new  frontiers  in  terms  of  oil  extraction  are  scrambling  about  in  alberta <comma> or  at  the  bottom  of  the  oceans <period> there  are  98  oil-producing  nations  in  the  world <period> but  of  those <comma> 65  have  already  passed  their  peak <period> the  moment  when  the  world  on  average  passes  this  peak <comma> people  wonder  when  that  's  going  to  happen <period> and  there  is  an  emerging  case  that  maybe  that  was  what  happened  last  july  when  the  oil  prices  were  so  high <period> but  are  we  to  assume  that  the  same  brilliance  and  creativity  and  adaptability  that  got  us  up  to  the  top  of  that  energy  mountain  in  the  first  place  is  somehow  mysteriously  going  to  evaporate  when  we  have  to  design  a  creative  way  back  down  the  other  side <questionmark> no <period> but  the  thinking  that  we  have  to  come  up  with  has  to  be  based  on  a  realistic  assessment  of  where  we  are <period> there  is  also  the  issue  of  climate  change <period> is  the  other  thing  that  underpins  this  transition  approach <period> but  the  thing  that  i  notice <comma> as  i  talk  to  climate  scientists <comma> is  the  increasingly  terrified  look  they  have  in  their  eyes <comma> as  the  data  that  's  coming  in <comma> which  is  far  ahead  of  what  the  ipcc  are  talking  about <period> so  the  ipcc  said  that  we  might  see  significant  breakup  of  the  arctic  ice  in  2100 <comma> in  their  worst  case  scenario <period> actually <comma> if  current  trends  continue <comma> it  could  all  be  gone  in  five  or  10  years  time <period> if  just  three  percent  of  the  carbon  locked  up  in  the  arctic  permafrost  is  released  as  the  world  warms <comma> it  would  offset  all  the  savings  that  we  need  to  make <comma> in  carbon <comma> over  the  next  40  years  to  avoid  runaway  climate  change <period> we  have  no  choice  other  than  deep  and  urgent  decarbonization <period> but  i  'm  always  very  interested  to  think  about  what  might  the  stories  be  that  the  generations  further  down  the  slope  from  us  are  going  to  tell  about  us <period> the  generation  that  lived  at  the  top  of  the  mountain <comma> that  partied  so  hard <comma> and  so  abused  its  inheritance <period> and  one  of  the  ways  i  like  to  do  that  is  to  look  back  at  the  stories  people  used  to  tell  before  we  had  cheap  oil <comma> before  we  had  fossil  fuels <comma> and  people  relied  on  their  own  muscle <comma> animal  muscle  energy <comma> or  a  little  bit  of  wind <comma> little  bit  of  water  energy <period> we  had  stories  like  the  seven-league  boots <comma> the  giant  who  had  these  boots <comma> where <comma> once  you  put  them  on <comma> with  every  stride  you  could  cover  seven  leagues <comma> or  21  miles <comma> a  kind  of  travel  completely  unimaginable  to  people  without  that  kind  of  energy  at  their  disposal <period> stories  like  the  magic  porridge  pot <comma> where  you  had  a  pot  where  if  you  knew  the  magic  words <comma> this  pot  would  just  make  as  much  food  as  you  liked <comma> without  you  having  to  do  any  work <comma> provided  you  could  remember  the  other  magic  word  to  stop  it  making  porridge <period> otherwise  you'd  flood  your  entire  town  with  warm  porridge <period> there  is  the  story  of  the  elves  and  the  shoemaker  the  people  who  make  shoes  go  to  sleep <comma> wake  up  in  the  morning <comma> and  all  the  shoes  are  magically  made  for  them <period> it  's  something  that  was  unimaginable  to  people  then <period> now  we  have  the  seven-league  boots  in  the  form  of  ryanair  and  easyjet <period> we  have  the  magic  porridge  pot  in  the  form  of  walmart  and  tesco <period> and  we  have  the  elves  in  the  form  of  china <period> but  we  do  n't  appreciate  what  an  astonishing  thing  that  has  been <period> and  what  are  the  stories  that  we  tell  ourselves  now <comma> as  we  look  forward  about  where  we  're  going  to  go <period> and  i  would  argue  that  there  are  four <period> there  is  the  idea  of  business  as  usual <comma> that  the  future  will  be  like  the  present <comma> just  more  of  it <period> but  as  we've  seen  over  the  last  year <comma> i  think  that  's  an  idea  that  is  increasingly  coming  into  question <period> and  in  terms  of  climate  change <comma> is  something  that  is  not  actually  feasible <period> there  is  the  idea  of  hitting  the  wall <comma> that  actually  somehow  everything  is  so  fragile  that  it  might  just  all  unravel  and  collapse <period> this  is  a  popular  story  in  some  places <period> the  third  story  is  the  idea  that  technology  can  solve  everything <comma> that  technology  can  somehow  get  us  through  this  completely <period> and  it  's  an  idea  that  i  think  is  very  prevalent  at  these  ted  talks <comma> the  idea  that  we  can  invent  our  way  out  of  a  profound  economic  and  energy  crisis <comma> that  a  move  to  a  knowledge  economy  can  somehow  neatly  sidestep  those  energy  constraints <comma> the  idea  that  we  'll  discover  some  fabulous  new  source  of  energy  that  will  mean  we  can  sweep  all  concerns  about  energy  security  to  one  side <comma> the  idea  that  we  can  step  off  neatly  onto  a  completely  renewable  world <period> but  the  world  is  n't  second  life <period> we  cannot  create  new  land  and  new  energy  systems  at  the  click  of  a  mouse <period> and  as  we  sit <comma> exchanging  free  ideas  with  each  other <comma> there  are  still  people  mining  coal  in  order  to  power  the  servers <comma> extracting  the  minerals  to  make  all  of  those  things <period> the  breakfast  that  we  eat  as  we  sit  down  to  check  our  email  in  the  morning  is  still  transported  at  great  distances <comma> usually  at  the  expense  of  the  local <comma> more  resilient  food  systems  that  would  have  supplied  that  in  the  past <comma> which  we've  so  effectively  devalued  and  dismantled <period> we  can  be  astonishingly  inventive  and  creative <period> but  we  also  live  in  a  world  with  very  real  constraints  and  demands <period> energy  and  technology  are  not  the  same  thing <period> what  i  'm  involved  with  is  the  transition  response <period> and  this  is  really  about  looking  the  challenges  of  peak  oil  and  climate  change  square  in  the  face <comma> and  responding  with  a  creativity  and  an  adaptability  and  an  imagination  that  we  really  need <period> it  's  something  which  has  spread  incredibly  fast <period> and  it  is  something  which  has  several  characteristics <period> it  's  viral <period> it  seems  to  spread  under  the  radar  very <comma> very  quickly <period> it  's  open  source <period> it  's  something  which  everybody  who  's  involved  with  it  develops  and  passes  on  as  they  work  with  it <period> it  's  self-organizing <period> there  is  no  great  central  organization  that  pushes  this <period> people  just  pick  up  an  idea  and  they  run  with  it <comma> and  they  implement  it  where  they  are <period> it  's  solutions-focused <period> it  's  very  much  looking  at  what  people  can  do  where  they  are <comma> to  respond  to  this <period> it  's  sensitive  to  place  and  to  scale <period> transitional  is  completely  different <period> transition  groups  in  chile <comma> transition  groups  in  the  us <comma> transition  groups  here <comma> what  they  're  doing  looks  very  different  in  every  place  that  you  go  to <period> it  learns  very  much  from  its  mistakes <period> and  it  feels  historic <period> it  tries  to  create  a  sense  that  this  is  a  historic  opportunity  to  do  something  really  extraordinary <period> and  it  's  a  process  which  is  really  joyful <period> people  have  a  huge  amount  of  fun  doing  this <comma> reconnecting  with  other  people  as  they  do  it <period> one  of  the  things  that  underpins  it  is  this  idea  of  resilience <period> and  i  think <comma> in  many  ways <comma> the  idea  of  resilience  is  a  more  useful  concept  than  the  idea  of  sustainability <period> the  idea  of  resilience  comes  from  the  study  of  ecology <period> and  it  's  really  about  how  systems <comma> settlements <comma> withstand  shock  from  the  outside <period> when  they  encounter  shock  from  the  outside  that  they  do  n't  just  unravel  and  fall  to  pieces <period> and  i  think  it  's  a  more  useful  concept  than  sustainability <comma> as  i  said <period> when  our  supermarkets  have  only  two  or  three  days  worth  of  food  in  them  at  any  one  time <comma> often  sustainability  tends  to  focus  on  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  freezers  and  on  the  packaging  that  the  lettuces  are  wrapped  up  in <period> looking  through  the  lens  of  resilience <comma> we  really  question  how  we've  let  ourselves  get  into  a  situation  that  's  so  vulnerable <period> resilience  runs  much  deeper <comma> it  's  about  building  modularity  into  what  we  do <comma> building  surge  breakers  into  how  we  organize  the  basic  things  that  support  us <period> this  is  a  photograph  of  the  bristol  and  district  market  gardeners  association <comma> in  1897 <period> this  is  at  a  time  when  the  city  of  bristol <comma> which  is  quite  close  to  here <comma> was  surrounded  by  commercial  market  gardens <comma> which  provided  a  significant  amount  of  the  food  that  was  consumed  in  the  town <comma> and  created  a  lot  of  employment  for  people <comma> as  well <period> there  was  a  degree  of  resilience <comma> if  you  like <comma> at  that  time <comma> which  we  can  now  only  look  back  on  with  envy <period> so  how  does  this  transition  idea  work <questionmark> so  basically <comma> you  have  a  group  of  people  who  are  excited  by  the  idea <period> they  pick  up  some  of  the  tools  that  we've  developed <period> they  start  to  run  an  awareness-raising  program  looking  at  how  this  might  actually  work  in  the  town <period> they  show  films <comma> they  give  talks <comma> and  so  on <period> it  's  a  process  which  is  playful  and  creative <period> and  informative <period> then  they  start  to  form  working  groups <comma> looking  at  different  aspects  of  this <comma> and  then  from  that <comma> there  emerge  a  whole  lot  of  projects  which  then  the  transition  project  itself  starts  to  support  and  enable <period> so  it  started  out  with  some  work  i  was  involved  in  in  ireland <comma> where  i  was  teaching <comma> and  has  since  spread <period> there  are  now  over  200  formal  transition  projects <period> and  there  are  thousands  of  others  who  are  at  what  we  call  the  mulling  stage <period> they  are  mulling  whether  they  're  going  to  take  it  further <period> and  actually  a  lot  of  them  are  doing  huge  amounts  of  stuff <period> but  what  do  they  actually  do <questionmark> you  know <comma> it  's  a  kind  of  nice  idea <comma> but  what  do  they  actually  do  on  the  ground <questionmark> well <comma> i  think  it  's  really  important  to  make  the  point  that  actually  you  know <comma> this  is  n't  something  which  is  going  to  do  everything  on  its  own <period> we  need  international  legislation  from  copenhagen  and  so  on <period> we  need  national  responses <period> we  need  local  government  responses <period> but  all  of  those  things  are  going  to  be  much  easier  if  we  have  communities  that  are  vibrant  and  coming  up  with  ideas  and  leading  from  the  front <comma> making  unelectable  policies  electable <comma> over  the  next  5  to  10  years <period> some  of  the  things  that  emerge  from  it  are  local  food  projects <comma> like  community-supported  agriculture  schemes <comma> urban  food  production <comma> creating  local  food  directories <comma> and  so  on <period> a  lot  of  places  now  are  starting  to  set  up  their  own  energy  companies <comma> community-owned  energy  companies <comma> where  the  community  can  invest  money  into  itself <comma> to  start  putting  in  place  the  kind  of  renewable  energy  infrastructure  that  we  need <period> a  lot  of  places  are  working  with  their  local  schools <period> newent  in  the  forest  of  dean <comma> big  polytunnel  they  built  for  the  school <period> the  kids  are  learning  how  to  grow  food <period> promoting  recycling <comma> things  like  garden-share <comma> that  matches  up  people  who  do  n't  have  a  garden  who  would  like  to  grow  food <comma> with  people  who  have  gardens  they  are  n't  using  anymore <period> planting  productive  trees  throughout  urban  spaces <period> and  also  starting  to  play  around  with  the  idea  of  alternative  currencies <period> this  is  lewes  in  sussex <comma> who  have  recently  launched  the  lewes  pound <comma> a  currency  that  you  can  only  spend  within  the  town <comma> as  a  way  of  starting  to  cycle  money  within  the  local  economy <period> you  take  it  anywhere  else <comma> it  's  not  worth  anything <period> but  actually  within  the  town  you  start  to  create  these  economic  cycles  much  more  effectively <period> another  thing  that  they  do  is  what  we  call  an  energy  descent  plan <comma> which  is  basically  to  develop  a  plan  b  for  the  town <period> most  of  our  local  authorities <comma> when  they  sit  down  to  plan  for  the  next  five <comma> 10 <comma> 15 <comma> 20  years  of  a  community <comma> still  start  by  assuming  that  there  will  be  more  energy <comma> more  cars <comma> more  housing <comma> more  jobs <comma> more  growth <comma> and  so  on <period> what  does  it  look  like  if  that  's  not  the  case <questionmark> and  how  can  we  embrace  that  and  actually  come  up  with  something  that  was  actually  more  likely  to  sustain  everybody <questionmark> as  a  friend  of  mine  says <comma> life  is  a  series  of  things  you  're  not  quite  ready  for  and  that  's  certainly  been  my  experience  with  transition <period> from  three  years  ago <comma> it  just  being  an  idea <comma> this  has  become  something  that  has  virally  swept  around  the  world <period> we  're  getting  a  lot  of  interest  from  government <period> ed  miliband <period> the  energy  minister  of  this  country <comma> was  invited  to  come  to  our  recent  conference  as  a  keynote  listener <period> which  he  did  -- <period> --  and  has  since  become  a  great  advocate  of  the  whole  idea <period> there  are  now  two  local  authorities  in  this  country  who  have  declared  themselves  transitional  local  authorities <comma> leicestershire  and  somerset <period> and  in  stroud <comma> the  transition  group  there <comma> in  effect <comma> wrote  the  local  government  's  food  plan <period> and  the  head  of  the  council  said <comma> if  we  did  n't  have  transition  stroud <comma> we  would  have  to  invent  all  of  that  community  infrastructure  for  the  first  time <period> as  we  see  the  spread  of  it <comma> we  see  national  hubs  emerging <period> in  scotland <comma> the  scottish  government  's  climate  change  fund  has  funded  transition  scotland  as  a  national  organization  supporting  the  spread  of  this <period> and  we  see  it  all  over  the  place  as  well  now <period> but  the  key  to  transition  is  thinking  not  that  we  have  to  change  everything  now <comma> but  that  things  are  already  inevitably  changing <period> and  what  we  need  to  do  is  to  work  creatively  with  that <comma> based  on  asking  the  right  questions <period> i  think  i'd  like  to  just  return  at  the  end  to  the  idea  of  stories <period> because  i  think  stories  are  vital  here <period> and  actually  the  stories  that  we  tell  ourselves <comma> we  have  a  huge  dearth  of  stories  about  how  to  move  forward  creatively  from  here <period> and  one  of  the  key  things  that  transition  does  is  to  pull  those  stories  out  of  what  people  are  doing <period> stories  about  the  community  that  's  produced  its  own  21  pound  note <comma> for  example <comma> the  school  that  's  turned  its  car  park  into  a  food  garden <comma> the  community  that  's  founded  its  own  energy  company <period> and  for  me <comma> one  of  the  great  stories  recently  was  the  obamas  digging  up  the  south  lawn  of  the  white  house  to  create  a  vegetable  garden <period> because  the  last  time  that  was  done <comma> when  eleanor  roosevelt  did  it <comma> it  led  to  the  creation  of  20  million  vegetable  gardens  across  the  united  states <period> so  the  question  i'd  like  to  leave  you  with <comma> really <comma> is <comma> for  all  aspects  of  the  things  that  your  community  needs  in  order  to  thrive <comma> how  can  it  be  done  in  such  a  way  that  drastically  reduces  its  carbon  emissions <comma> while  also  building  resilience <questionmark> personally <comma> i  feel  enormously  grateful  to  have  lived  through  the  age  of  cheap  oil <period> i've  been  astonishingly  lucky <comma> we've  been  astonishingly  lucky <period> but  let  us  honor  what  it  has  bought  us <comma> and  move  forward  from  this  point <period> because  if  we  cling  to  it <comma> and  continue  to  assume  that  it  can  underpin  our  choices <comma> the  future  that  it  presents  to  us  is  one  which  is  really  unmanageable <period> and  by  loving  and  leaving  all  that  oil  has  done  for  us <comma> and  that  the  oil  age  has  done  for  us <comma> we  are  able  to  then  begin  the  creation  of  a  world  which  is  more  resilient <comma> more  nourishing <comma> and  in  which <comma> we  find  ourselves  fitter <comma> more  skilled  and  more  connected  to  each  other <period> thank  you  very  much <period> of  the  five  senses <comma> vision  is  the  one  that  i  appreciate  the  most <comma> and  it  's  the  one  that  i  can  least  take  for  granted <period> i  think  this  is  partially  due  to  my  father <comma> who  was  blind <period> it  was  a  fact  that  he  did  n't  make  much  of  a  fuss  about <comma> usually <period> one  time  in  nova  scotia <comma> when  we  went  to  see  a  total  eclipse  of  the  sun <comma> yeah <comma> same  one  as  in  the  carly  simon  song <comma> which  may  or  may  not  refer  to  james  taylor <comma> warren  beatty  or  mick  jagger <period> we  're  not  really  sure <period> they  handed  out  these  dark  plastic  viewers  that  allowed  us  to  look  directly  at  the  sun  without  damaging  our  eyes <period> but  dad  got  really  scared <comma> he  did  n't  want  us  doing  that <period> he  wanted  us  instead  to  use  these  cheap  cardboard  viewers  so  that  there  was  no  chance  at  all  that  our  eyes  would  be  damaged <period> i  thought  this  was  a  little  strange  at  the  time <period> what  i  did  n't  know  at  the  time  was  that  my  father  had  actually  been  born  with  perfect  eyesight <period> when  he  and  his  sister  martha  were  just  very  little <comma> their  mom  took  them  out  to  see  a  total  eclipse <comma> or  actually <comma> a  solar  eclipse <comma> and  not  long  after  that <comma> both  of  them  started  losing  their  eyesight <period> decades  later <comma> it  turned  out  that  the  source  of  their  blindness  was  most  likely  some  sort  of  bacterial  infection <period> as  near  as  we  can  tell <comma> it  had  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  that  solar  eclipse <comma> but  by  then  my  grandmother  had  already  gone  to  her  grave  thinking  it  was  her  fault <period> so <comma> dad  graduated  harvard  in  1946 <comma> married  my  mom <comma> and  bought  a  house  in  lexington <comma> massachusetts <comma> where  the  first  shots  were  fired  against  the  british  in  1775 <comma> although  we  did  n't  actually  hit  any  of  them  until  concord <period> he  got  a  job  working  for  raytheon <comma> designing  guidance  systems <comma> which  was  part  of  the  route  128  high-tech  axis  in  those  days <comma> so  the  equivalent  of  silicone  valley  in  the  70s <period> dad  was  n't  a  real  militaristic  kind  of  guy <period> he  just  really  felt  bad  that  he  was  n't  able  to  fight  in  world  war  ii  on  account  of  his  handicap <comma> although  they  did  let  him  get  through  the  several-hour-long  army  physical  exam  before  they  got  to  the  very  last  test <comma> which  was  for  vision <period> so <comma> dad  started  racking  up  all  of  these  patents  and  gaining  a  reputation  as  a  blind  genius <comma> rocket  scientist <comma> inventor <period> but  to  us  he  was  just  dad <comma> and  our  home  life  was  pretty  normal <period> as  a  kid <comma> i  watched  a  lot  of  television  and  had  lots  of  nerdy  hobbies  like  mineralogy  and  microbiology  and  the  space  program  and  a  little  bit  of  politics <period> i  played  a  lot  of  chess <period> but  at  the  age  of  14 <comma> a  friend  of  mine  got  me  interested  in  comic  books <comma> and  i  decided  that  was  what  i  wanted  to  do  for  a  living <period> so <comma> here  's  my  dad <comma> he  's  a  scientist <comma> he  's  an  engineer  and  he  's  a  military  contractor <period> so <comma> he  has  four  kids <comma> right <questionmark> one  grows  up  to  become  a  computer  scientist <comma> one  grows  up  to  join  the  navy <comma> one  grows  up  to  become  an  engineer <comma> and  then  there  's  me <comma> the  comic  book  artist <period> which <comma> incidentally <comma> makes  me  the  opposite  of  dean  kamen <comma> because  i  'm  a  comic  book  artist <comma> son  of  an  inventor <comma> and  he  's  an  inventor <comma> son  of  a  comic  book  artist <period> right <comma> it  's  true <period> the  funny  thing  is <comma> dad  had  a  lot  of  faith  in  me <period> he  had  faith  in  my  abilities  as  a  cartoonist <comma> even  though  he  had  no  direct  evidence  that  i  was  any  good  whatsoever <comma> everything  he  saw  was  just  a  blur <period> now <comma> this  gives  a  real  meaning  to  the  term  blind  faith <comma> which  does  n't  have  the  same  negative  connotation  for  me  that  it  does  for  other  people <period> now <comma> faith  in  things  which  cannot  be  seen <comma> which  cannot  be  proved <comma> is  not  the  sort  of  faith  that  i've  ever  really  related  to  all  that  much <period> i  tend  to  like  science <comma> where  what  we  see  and  can  ascertain  are  the  foundation  of  what  we  know <period> but  there  's  a  middle  ground <comma> too <period> a  middle  ground  tread  by  people  like  poor  old  charles  babbage <comma> and  his  steam-driven  computers  that  were  never  built <period> nobody  really  understood  what  it  was  that  he  had  in  mind <comma> except  for  ada  lovelace <comma> and  he  went  to  his  grave  trying  to  pursue  that  dream <period> vannevar  bush  with  his  memex <comma> this  idea  of  all  of  human  knowledge  at  your  fingertips <comma> he  had  this  vision <period> and  i  think  a  lot  of  people  in  his  day  probably  thought  he  was  a  bit  of  a  kook <period> and <comma> yeah <comma> we  can  look  back  in  retrospect  and  say <comma> yeah <comma> ha-ha <comma> you  know <comma> it  's  all  microfilm <period> but  that  's  -- <period> that  's  not  the  point <period> he  understood  the  shape  of  the  future <period> so  did  jcr <period> licklider  and  his  notions  for  computer-human  interaction <period> same  thing <comma> he  understood  the  shape  of  the  future <comma> even  though  it  was  something  that  would  only  be  implemented  by  people  much  later <period> or  paul  baran <comma> and  his  vision  for  packet  switching <period> hardly  anybody  listened  to  him  in  his  day <period> or  even  the  people  who  actually  pulled  it  off <comma> the  people  at  bolt <comma> beranek  and  newman  in  boston <comma> who  just  would  sketch  out  these  structures  of  what  would  eventually  become  a  worldwide  network <comma> and  sketching  things  on  the  back  of  napkins  and  on  note  papers  and  arguing  over  dinner  at  howard  johnson  's <comma> on  route  128  in  lexington <comma> massachusetts <comma> just  two  miles  from  where  i  was  studying  the  queen  's  gambit  deferred  and  listening  to  gladys  knight  &amp <period> the  pips  singing  midnight  train  to  georgia <comma> while <comma> in  my  dad  's  big  easy  chair <comma> you  know <questionmark> so <comma> three  types  of  vision <comma> right <questionmark> vision  based  on  what  one  cannot  see <comma> the  vision  of  that  unseen  and  unknowable <period> the  vision  of  that  which  has  already  been  proven  or  can  be  ascertained <period> and  this  third  kind  of  vision <comma> of  something  which  can  be <comma> which  may  be <comma> based  on  knowledge <comma> but  is  as  yet  unproven <period> now <comma> we've  seen  a  lot  of  examples  of  people  who  are  pursuing  that  sort  of  vision  in  science <comma> but  i  think  it  's  also  true  in  the  arts <comma> it  's  true  in  politics <comma> it  's  even  true  in  personal  endeavors <period> what  it  comes  down  to <comma> really <comma> is  four  basic  principles <comma> learn  from  everyone <comma> follow  no  one <comma> watch  for  patterns <comma> and  work  like  hell <period> i  think  these  are  the  four  principles  that  go  into  this <period> and  it  's  that  third  one <comma> especially <comma> where  visions  of  the  future  begin  to  manifest  themselves <period> what  's  interesting  is  that  this  particular  way  of  looking  at  the  world <comma> is <comma> i  think <comma> only  one  of  four  different  ways  that  manifest  themselves  in  different  fields  of  endeavor <period> in  comics <comma> i  know  that  it  results  in  sort  of  a  formalist  attitude  towards  trying  to  understand  how  it  works <period> then  there  's  another <comma> more  classical <comma> attitude  which  embraces  beauty  and  craft <period> another  one  which  believes  in  the  pure  transparency  of  content <period> and  then  another  which  emphasizes  the  authenticity  of  human  experience <comma> and  honesty <comma> and  rawness <period> these  are  four  very  different  ways  of  looking  at  the  world <period> i  even  gave  them  names <period> the  classicist <comma> the  animist <comma> and  formalist  and  iconoclast <period> interestingly <comma> it  seemed  to  correspond  more  or  less  to  jung  's  four  subdivisions  of  human  thought <period> and  they  reflect  a  dichotomy  of  art  and  delight  on  left  and  the  right <period> tradition  and  revolution  on  the  top  and  the  bottom <period> and  if  you  go  on  the  diagonal <comma> you  get  content  and  form <comma> and  then  beauty  and  truth <period> and  it  probably  applies  just  as  much  to  music  and  to  movies  and  to  fine  art <comma> which  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  vision  at  all <comma> or  for  that  matter <comma> nothing  to  do  with  our  conference  theme  of  inspired  by  nature <comma> except  to  the  extent  of  the  fable  of  the  frog  who  gives  the  ride  to  the  scorpion  on  his  back  to  get  across  the  river  because  the  scorpion  promises  not  to  sting  him <comma> but  then  the  scorpion  does  sting  him  anyway  and  they  both  die <comma> but  not  before  the  frog  asks  him  why  and  the  scorpion  says <comma> because  it  's  my  nature <comma> in  that  sense <comma> yes <period> so <comma> so  this  was  my  nature <period> the  thing  was <comma> i  saw  that  the  route  that  i  took  to  discovering  this  focus  in  my  work  and  who  i  was <comma> i  saw  it  as  just  this  road  to  discovery <period> actually <comma> it  was  just  me  embracing  my  nature <comma> which  means  that  i  did  n't  actually  fall  that  far  from  the  tree  after  all <period> so  what  does  a  scientific  mind  do  in  the  arts <questionmark> well <comma> i  started  making  comics <comma> but  i  also  started  trying  to  understand  them <comma> almost  immediately <period> and  one  of  the  most  important  things  about  comics <comma> i  discovered <comma> was  that  comics  are  a  visual  medium <comma> but  they  try  to  embrace  all  of  the  senses  within  it <period> so <comma> the  different  elements  of  comics <comma> like  pictures  and  words <comma> and  the  different  symbols  and  everything  in  between  that  comics  presents  are  all  funneled  through  the  single  conduit  of  vision <period> so  you  have  things  like  resemblance <comma> where  something  which  resembles  the  physical  world  can  be  abstracted  in  a  couple  of  different  directions <comma> abstracted  from  resemblance <comma> but  still  retaining  the  complete  meaning <comma> or  abstracted  away  from  both  resemblance  and  meaning  towards  the  picture  plan <period> put  all  these  three  together <comma> and  you  have  a  nice  little  map  of  the  entire  boundary  of  visual  iconography  which  comics  can  embrace <period> and  if  you  move  to  the  right  you  also  get  language <comma> because  that  's  abstracting  even  further  from  resemblance <comma> but  still  maintaining  meaning <period> vision  is  called  upon  to  represent  sound  and  to  understand  the  common  properties  of  those  two  and  their  common  heritage <comma> as  well <period> also <comma> to  try  to  represent  the  texture  of  sound  to  capture  its  essential  character  through  visuals <period> and  there  's  also  a  balance  between  the  visible  and  the  invisible  in  comics <period> comics  is  a  kind  of  call  and  response  in  which  the  artist  gives  you  something  to  see  within  the  panels <comma> and  then  gives  you  something  to  imagine  between  the  panels <period> also <comma> another  sense  which  comics  vision  represents <comma> and  that  's  time <period> sequence  is  a  very  important  aspect  of  comics <period> comics  presents  a  kind  of  temporal  map <period> and  this  temporal  map  was  something  that  energizes  modern  comics <comma> but  i  was  wondering  if  perhaps  it  also  energizes  other  sorts  of  forms <comma> and  i  found  some  in  history <period> and  you  can  see  this  same  principle  operating  in  these  ancient  versions  of  the  same  idea <period> what  's  happening  is <comma> the  art  form  is  colliding  with  the  given  technology <comma> whether  it  's  paint  on  stone <comma> like  the  tomb  of  the  scribe  in  ancient  egypt <comma> or  a  bas-relief  sculpture  rising  up  a  stone  column <comma> or  a  200-foot-long  embroidery <comma> or  painted  deerskin  and  tree  bark  running  across  88  accordion-folded  pages <period> what  's  interesting  is <comma> once  you  hit  print <comma> and  this  is  from  1450 <comma> by  the  way <comma> all  of  the  artifacts  of  modern  comics  start  to  present  themselves <comma> rectilinear  panel  arrangements <comma> simple  line  drawings  without  tone  and  a  left-to-right  reading  sequence <period> and  within  100  years <comma> you  already  start  to  see  word  balloons  and  captions <comma> and  it  's  really  just  a  hop <comma> skip  and  a  jump  from  here  to  here <period> so  i  wrote  a  book  about  this  in  93 <comma> but  as  i  was  finishing  the  book <comma> i  had  to  do  a  little  bit  of  typesetting <comma> and  i  was  tired  of  going  to  my  local  copy  shop  to  do  it <comma> so  i  bought  a  computer <period> and  it  was  just  a  little  thing <comma> it  was  n't  good  for  much  except  text  entry <comma> but  my  father  had  told  me  about  moore  's  law <comma> about  moore  's  law  back  in  the  70s <comma> and  i  knew  what  was  coming <period> and  so <comma> i  kept  my  eyes  peeled  to  see  if  the  sort  of  changes  that  happened  when  we  went  from  pre-print  comics  to  print  comics  would  happen  when  we  went  beyond <comma> to  post-print  comics <period> so <comma> one  of  the  first  things  that  were  proposed  was  that  we  could  mix  the  visuals  of  comics  with  the  sound <comma> motion  and  interactivity  of  the  cd-roms.  that  were  being  made  in  those  days <period> this  was  even  before  the  web <period> and  one  of  the  first  things  they  did  was <comma> they  tried  to  take  the  comics  page  as-is  and  transplant  it  to  monitors <comma> which  was  a  classic  mcluhanesque  mistake  of  appropriating  the  shape  of  the  previous  technology  as  the  content  of  the  new  technology <period> and  so <comma> what  they  would  do  is <comma> they'd  have  these  comic  pages  that  resemble  print  comics  pages <comma> and  they  would  introduce  all  this  sound  and  motion <period> the  problem  was <comma> that  if  you  go  with  this  idea <comma> this  basic  idea  that  space  equals  time  in  comics <comma> what  happens  is  that  when  you  introduce  sound  and  motion <comma> which  are  temporal  phenomena  that  can  only  be  represented  through  time <comma> then  they  break  with  that  continuity  of  presentation <period> interactivity  was  another  thing <period> there  were  hypertext  comics <period> but  the  thing  about  hypertext  is  that  everything  in  hypertext  is  either  here <comma> not  here  or  connected  to  here <period> it  's  profoundly  non-spatial <period> the  distance  from  abraham  lincoln  to  a  lincoln  penny <comma> the  penny  marshall  to  the  marshall  plan  to  plan  9  to  nine  lives <comma> it  's  all  the  same <period> and <comma> but  in  comics <comma> in  comics <comma> every  aspect  of  the  work <comma> every  element  of  the  work  has  a  spatial  relationship  to  every  other  element  at  all  times <period> so  the  question  was <comma> was  there  any  way  to  preserve  that  spatial  relationship  while  still  taking  advantage  of  all  of  the  things  that  digital  had  to  offer  us <questionmark> and  i  found  my  personal  answer  for  this  in  those  ancient  comics  that  i  was  showing  you <period> each  of  them  has  a  single  unbroken  reading  line <comma> whether  it  's  going  zigzag  across  the  walls  or  spiraling  up  a  column  or  just  straight  left  to  right <comma> or  even  going  in  a  backwards  zigzag  across  those  88  accordion-folded  pages <period> the  same  thing  is  happening <comma> and  that  is  that  the  basic  idea  that  as  you  move  through  space  you  move  through  time  is  being  carried  out  without  any  compromise <comma> but  there  were  compromises  when  print  hit <period> adjacent  spaces  were  no  longer  adjacent  moments <comma> so  the  basic  idea  of  comics  was  being  broken  again  and  again  and  again  and  again <period> and  i  thought <comma> ok <comma> well <comma> if  that  's  true <comma> is  there  any  way <comma> when  we  go  beyond  today  's  print <comma> to  somehow  bring  that  back <questionmark> now <comma> the  monitor  is  just  as  limited  as  the  page <comma> technically <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  a  different  shape <comma> but  other  than  that  it  's  the  same  basic  limitation <period> but  that  's  only  if  you  look  at  the  monitor  as  a  page <comma> but  not  if  you  look  at  the  monitor  as  a  window <period> and  that  's  what  i  proposed <comma> that  perhaps  we  could  create  these  comics  on  an  infinite  canvas <comma> along  the  x  axis  and  the  y  axis  and  staircases <period> we  could  do  circular  narratives  that  were  literally  circular <period> we  could  do  a  turn  in  a  story  that  was  literally  a  turn <period> parallel  narratives  could  be  literally  parallel <period> x <comma> y  and  also  z <period> so  i  had  all  these  notions <period> this  was  back  in  the  late  90s <comma> and  other  people  in  my  business  thought  i  was  pretty  crazy <comma> but  a  lot  of  people  then  went  on  and  actually  did  it <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  couple  now <period> this  was  an  early  collage  comic  by  a  fellow  named  jason  lex <period> and  notice  what  's  going  on  here <period> what  i  'm  searching  for  is  a  durable  mutation <comma> that  's  what  all  of  us  are  searching  for <period> as  media  head  into  this  new  era <comma> we  are  looking  for  mutations  that  are  durable <comma> that  have  some  sort  of  staying  power <period> now <comma> we  're  taking  this  basic  idea  of  presenting  comics  in  a  visual  medium <comma> and  then  we  're  carrying  it  through  all  the  way  from  beginning  to  end <period> that  's  that  entire  comic  you  just  saw  is  up  on  the  screen  right  now <period> but  even  though  we  're  only  experiencing  it  one  piece  at  a  time <comma> that  's  just  where  the  technology  is  right  now <period> as  the  technology  evolves <comma> as  you  get  full  immersive  displays  and  whatnot <comma> this  sort  of  thing  will  only  grow <period> it  will  adapt <period> it  will <period> adapt  to  its  environment <comma> it  's  a  durable  mutation <period> here  's  another  one  i  'll  show  you <period> this  is  by  dr.ew  weing <period> this  is  called <comma> pup  contemplates  the  heat  death  of  the  universe  see  what  's  going  on  here  as  we  draw  these  stories  on  an  infinite  canvas  is  you  're  creating  a  more  pure  expression  of  what  this  medium  is  all  about <period> we  'll  go  by  this  a  little  quickly <comma> you  get  the  idea <period> i  just  want  to  get  to  the  last  panel <period> there  we  go <period> just  one  more <period> talk  about  your  infinite  canvas <period> it  's  by  a  guy  named  daniel  merlin  goodbrey  in  britain <period> why  is  this  important <questionmark> i  think  this  is  important  because  media <comma> all  media <comma> provide  us  a  window  back  into  our  world <period> now <comma> it  could  be  that  motion  pictures <comma> and  eventually <comma> virtual  reality <comma> or  something  equivalent  to  it <comma> some  sort  of  immersive  display <comma> is  going  to  provide  us  with  our  most  efficient  escape  from  the  world  that  we  're  in <period> that  's  why  most  people  turn  to  storytelling <comma> is  to  escape <period> but  media  provides  us  with  a  window  back  into  the  world  that  we  live  in <period> and  when  media  evolve  so  that  the  identity  of  the  media  becomes  increasingly  unique <period> because  what  you  're  looking  at  is <comma> you  're  looking  at  comics  cubed <comma> you  're  looking  at  comics  that  are  more  comics-like  than  they've  ever  been  before <period> when  that  happens <comma> you  provide  people  with  multiple  ways  of  re-entering  the  world  through  different  windows <comma> and  when  you  do  that <comma> it  allows  them  to  triangulate  the  world  that  they  live  in  and  see  its  shape <period> and  that  's  why  i  think  this  is  important <period> one  of  many  reasons <comma> but  i've  got  to  go  now <period> thank  you  for  having  me <period> last  year <comma> i  told  you  the  story <comma> in  seven  minutes <comma> of  project  orion <comma> which  was  this  very  implausible  technology  that  technically  could  have  worked <comma> but  it  had  this  one-year  political  window  where  it  could  have  happened <period> so  it  did  n't  happen <period> it  was  a  dream  that  did  not  happen <period> this  year  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  the  story  of  the  birth  of  digital  computing <period> this  was  a  perfect  introduction <period> and  it  's  a  story  that  did  work <period> it  did  happen <period> and  the  machines  are  all  around  us <period> and  it  was  a  technology  that  was  inevitable <period> if  the  people  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  the  story  about <comma> if  they  had  n't  done  it <comma> somebody  else  would  have <period> so <comma> it  was  sort  of  the  right  idea  at  the  right  time <period> this  is  barricelli  's  universe <period> this  is  the  universe  we  live  in  now <period> it  's  the  universe  in  which  these  machines  are  now  doing  all  these  things <comma> including  changing  biology <period> i  'm  starting  the  story  with  the  first  atomic  bomb  at  trinity <period> which  was  the  manhattan  project <period> it  was  a  little  bit  like  ted <comma> it  brought  a  whole  lot  of  very  smart  people  together <period> and  three  of  the  smartest  people  were  stan  ulam <comma> richard  feynman  and  john  von  neumann <period> and  it  was  von  neumann  who  said <comma> after  the  bomb <comma> he  was  working  on  something  much  more  important  than  bombs: <period> he  's  thinking  about  computers <period> so <comma> he  was  n't  only  thinking  about  them <period> he  built  one <period> this  is  the  machine  he  built <period> he  built  this  machine <comma> and  we  had  a  beautiful  demonstration  of  how  this  thing  really  works <comma> with  these  little  bits <period> and  it  's  an  idea  that  goes  way  back <period> the  first  person  to  really  explain  that  was  thomas  hobbes <comma> who <comma> in  1651 <comma> explained  how  arithmetic  and  logic  are  the  same  thing <comma> and  if  you  want  to  do  artificial  thinking  and  artificial  logic <comma> you  can  do  it  all  with  arithmetic <period> he  said  you  needed  addition  and  subtraction <period> leibniz <comma> who  came  a  little  bit  later <comma> this  is  1679 <comma> showed  that  you  did  n't  even  need  subtraction <period> you  could  do  the  whole  thing  with  addition <period> here <comma> we  have  all  the  binary  arithmetic  and  logic  that  drove  the  computer  revolution <period> and  leibniz  was  the  first  person  to  really  talk  about  building  such  a  machine <period> he  talked  about  doing  it  with  marbles <comma> having  gates  and  what  we  now  call  shift  registers <comma> where  you  shift  the  gates <comma> drop  the  marbles  down  the  tracks <period> and  that  's  what  all  these  machines  are  doing <comma> except <comma> instead  of  doing  it  with  marbles <comma> they  're  doing  it  with  electrons <period> and  then  we  jump  to  von  neumann <comma> 1945 <comma> when  he  sort  of  reinvents  the  whole  same  thing <period> and  1945 <comma> after  the  war <comma> the  electronics  existed  to  actually  try  and  build  such  a  machine <period> so  june  1945 <comma> actually <comma> the  bomb  has  n't  even  been  dropped  yet <comma> and  von  neumann  is  putting  together  all  the  theory  to  actually  build  this  thing <period> which  also  goes  back  to  turing <comma> who <comma> before  that <comma> gave  the  idea  that  you  could  do  all  this  with  a  very  brainless <comma> little <comma> finite  state  machine <comma> just  reading  a  tape  in  and  reading  a  tape  out <period> the  other  sort  of  genesis  of  what  von  neumann  did  was  the  difficulty  of  how  you  would  predict  the  weather <period> lewis  richardson  saw  how  you  could  do  this  with  a  cellular  array  of  people <comma> giving  them  each  a  little  chunk <comma> and  putting  it  together <period> here <comma> we  have  an  electrical  model  illustrating  a  mind  having  a  will <comma> but  capable  of  only  two  ideas <period> and  that  's  really  the  simplest  computer <period> it  's  basically  why  you  need  the  qubit <comma> because  it  only  has  two  ideas <period> and  you  put  lots  of  those  together <comma> you  get  the  essentials  of  the  modern  computer <comma> the  arithmetic  unit <comma> the  central  control <comma> the  memory <comma> the  recording  medium <comma> the  input  and  the  output <period> but <comma> there  's  one  catch <period> this  is  the  fatal <comma> you  know <period> we  saw  it  in  starting  these  programs  up <period> the  instructions  which  govern  this  operation  must  be  given  in  absolutely  exhaustive  detail <period> so <comma> the  programming  has  to  be  perfect <comma> or  it  wo  n't  work <period> if  you  look  at  the  origins  of  this <comma> the  classic  history  sort  of  takes  it  all  back  to  the  eniac  here <period> but  actually <comma> the  machine  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about <comma> the  institute  for  advanced  study  machine <comma> which  is  way  up  there <comma> really  should  be  down  there <period> so <comma> i  'm  trying  to  revise  history <comma> and  give  some  of  these  guys  more  credit  than  they've  had <period> such  a  computer  would  open  up  universes <comma> which  are <comma> at  the  present <comma> outside  the  range  of  any  instruments <period> so  it  opens  up  a  whole  new  world <comma> and  these  people  saw  it <period> the  guy  who  was  supposed  to  build  this  machine  was  the  guy  in  the  middle <comma> vladimir  zworykin <comma> from  rca <period> rca <comma> in  probably  one  of  the  lousiest  business  decisions  of  all  time <comma> decided  not  to  go  into  computers <period> but  the  first  meetings <comma> november  1945 <comma> were  at  rca  's  offices <period> rca  started  this  whole  thing  off <comma> and  said <comma> you  know <comma> televisions  are  the  future <comma> not  computers <period> the  essentials  were  all  there <comma> all  the  things  that  make  these  machines  run <period> von  neumann <comma> and  a  logician <comma> and  a  mathematician  from  the  army  put  this  together <period> then <comma> they  needed  a  place  to  build  it <period> when  rca  said  no <comma> that  's  when  they  decided  to  build  it  in  princeton <comma> where  freeman  works  at  the  institute <period> that  's  where  i  grew  up  as  a  kid <period> that  's  me <comma> that  's  my  sister  esther <comma> who  's  talked  to  you  before <period> so  we  both  go  back  to  the  birth  of  this  thing <period> that  's  freeman <comma> a  long  time  ago <period> and  that  was  me <period> and  this  is  von  neumann  and  morgenstern <comma> who  wrote  the  theory  of  games <period> all  these  forces  came  together  there <comma> in  princeton <period> oppenheimer <comma> who  had  built  the  bomb <period> the  machine  was  actually  used  mainly  for  doing  bomb  calculations <period> and  julian  bigelow <comma> who  took  zworkykin  's  place  as  the  engineer <comma> to  actually  figure  out <comma> using  electronics <comma> how  you  would  build  this  thing <period> the  whole  gang  of  people  who  came  to  work  on  this <comma> and  women  in  front <comma> who  actually  did  most  of  the  coding <comma> were  the  first  programmers <period> these  were  the  prototype  geeks <comma> the  nerds <period> they  did  n't  fit  in  at  the  institute <period> this  is  a  letter  from  the  director <comma> concerned  about <comma> especially  unfair  on  the  matter  of  sugar <period> you  can  read  the  text <period> this  is  hackers  getting  in  trouble  for  the  first  time <period> these  were  not  theoretical  physicists <period> they  were  real  soldering-gun  type  guys <comma> and  they  actually  built  this  thing <period> and  we  take  it  for  granted  now <comma> that  each  of  these  machines  has  billions  of  transistors <comma> doing  billions  of  cycles  per  second  without  failing <period> they  were  using  vacuum  tubes <comma> very  narrow <comma> sloppy  techniques  to  get  actually  binary  behavior  out  of  these  radio  vacuum  tubes <period> they  actually  used  6j6 <comma> the  common  radio  tube <comma> because  they  found  they  were  more  reliable  than  the  more  expensive  tubes <period> and  what  they  did  at  the  institute  was  publish  every  step  of  the  way <period> reports  were  issued <comma> so  that  this  machine  was  cloned  at  15  other  places  around  the  world <period> and  it  really  was <period> it  was  the  original  microprocessor <period> all  the  computers  now  are  copies  of  that  machine <period> the  memory  was  in  cathode  ray  tubes <comma> a  whole  bunch  of  spots  on  the  face  of  the  tube <comma> very <comma> very  sensitive  to  electromagnetic  disturbances <period> so <comma> there  's  40  of  these  tubes <comma> like  a  v-40  engine  running  the  memory <period> the  input  and  the  output  was  by  teletype  tape  at  first <period> this  is  a  wire  drive <comma> using  bicycle  wheels <period> this  is  the  archetype  of  the  hard  disk  that  's  in  your  machine  now <period> then  they  switched  to  a  magnetic  drum <period> this  is  modifying  ibm  equipment <comma> which  is  the  origins  of  the  whole  data-processing  industry <comma> later  at  ibm <period> and  this  is  the  beginning  of  computer  graphics <period> the  graph'g-beam  turn  on  this  next  slide <period> that  's  the <comma> as  far  as  i  know <comma> the  first  digital  bitmap  display <comma> 1954 <period> so <comma> von  neumann  was  already  off  in  a  theoretical  cloud <comma> doing  abstract  sorts  of  studies  of  how  you  could  build  reliable  machines  out  of  unreliable  components <period> those  guys  drinking  all  the  tea  with  sugar  in  it  were  writing  in  their  logbooks <comma> trying  to  get  this  thing  to  work <comma> with  all  these  2,600  vacuum  tubes  that  failed  half  the  time <period> and  that  's  what  i've  been  doing <comma> this  last  six  months <comma> is  going  through  the  logs <period> running  time <comma> two  minutes <period> input <comma> output <comma> 90  minutes <period> this  includes  a  large  amount  of  human  error <period> so  they  are  always  trying  to  figure  out <comma> what  's  machine  error <questionmark> what  's  human  error <questionmark> what  's  code <comma> what  's  hardware <questionmark> that  's  an  engineer  gazing  at  tube  number  36 <comma> trying  to  figure  out  why  the  memory  's  not  in  focus <period> he  had  to  focus  the  memory <comma> seems  ok <period> so <comma> he  had  to  focus  each  tube  just  to  get  the  memory  up  and  running <comma> let  alone  having <comma> you  know <comma> software  problems <period> no  use <comma> went  home <period> impossible  to  follow  the  damn  thing <comma> where  's  a  directory <questionmark> so <comma> already <comma> they  're  complaining  about  the  manuals <comma> before  closing  down  in  disgust <period> the  general  arithmetic <comma> operating  logs  burning  lots  of  midnight  oil <period> maniac <comma> which  became  the  acronym  for  the  machine <comma> mathematical  and  numerical  integrator  and  calculator <comma> lost  its  memory <period> maniac  regained  its  memory <comma> when  the  power  went  off  machine  or  human <questionmark> aha  so <comma> they  figured  out  it  's  a  code  problem <period> found  trouble  in  code <comma> i  hope <period> code  error <comma> machine  not  guilty <period> damn  it <comma> i  can  be  just  as  stubborn  as  this  thing <period> and  the  dawn  came  so  they  ran  all  night <period> twenty-four  hours  a  day <comma> this  thing  was  running <comma> mainly  running  bomb  calculations <period> everything  up  to  this  point  is  wasted  time  what  's  the  use <questionmark> good  night <period> master  control  off <period> the  hell  with  it <period> way  off <period> something  's  wrong  with  the  air  conditioner <comma> smell  of  burning  v-belts  in  the  air <period> a  short <comma> do  not  turn  the  machine  on <period> ibm  machine  putting  a  tar-like  substance  on  the  cards <period> the  tar  is  from  the  roof <period> so  they  really  were  working  under  tough  conditions <period> here <comma> a  mouse  has  climbed  into  the  blower  behind  the  regulator  rack <comma> set  blower  to  vibrating <period> result <comma> no  more  mouse <period> here  lies  mouse <period> born <comma>  <questionmark> died <comma> 4:50  am <comma> may  1953 <period> there  's  an  inside  joke  someone  has  penciled  in <comma> here  lies  marston  mouse <period> if  you  're  a  mathematician <comma> you  get  that <period> because  marston  was  a  mathematician  who  objected  to  the  computer  being  there <period> picked  a  lightning  bug  off  the  drum  running  at  two  kilocycles <period> that  's  two  thousand  cycles  per  second  -- <period> yes <comma> i  'm  chicken <comma> so  two  kilocycles  was  slow  speed <period> the  high  speed  was  16  kilocycles <period> i  do  n't  know  if  you  remember  a  mac  that  was  16  megahertz <period> that  's  slow  speed <period> i  have  now  duplicated  both  results <period> how  will  i  know  which  is  right <comma> assuming  one  result  is  correct <questionmark> this  now  is  the  third  different  output <period> i  know  when  i  'm  licked <period> we've  duplicated  errors  before <period> machine  run <comma> fine <period> code  is  n't <period> only  happens  when  the  machine  is  running <period> and  sometimes  things  are  okay <period> machine  a  thing  of  beauty <comma> and  a  joy  forever  perfect  running <period> parting  thought <comma> when  there  's  bigger  and  better  errors <comma> we  'll  have  them <period> so <comma> nobody  was  supposed  to  know  they  were  actually  designing  bombs <period> they  're  designing  hydrogen  bombs <period> but  someone  in  the  logbook <comma> late  one  night <comma> finally  drew  a  bomb <period> so <comma> that  was  the  result <period> it  was  mike <comma> the  first  thermonuclear  bomb <comma> in  1952 <period> that  was  designed  on  that  machine <comma> in  the  woods  behind  the  institute <period> so  von  neumann  invited  a  whole  gang  of  weirdos  from  all  over  the  world  to  work  on  all  these  problems <period> barricelli <comma> he  came  to  do  what  we  now  call <comma> really <comma> artificial  life <comma> trying  to  see  if <comma> in  this  artificial  universe  -- <period> he  was  a  viral-geneticist <comma> way <comma> way <comma> way  ahead  of  his  time <period> he  's  still  ahead  of  some  of  the  stuff  that  's  being  done  now <period> trying  to  start  an  artificial  genetic  system  running  in  the  computer <period> began <comma> his  universe  started  march  3 <comma> 53 <period> so  it  's  almost  exactly <comma> it  's  50  years  ago  next  tuesday <comma> i  guess <period> and  he  saw  everything  in  terms  of  -- <period> he  could  read  the  binary  code  straight  off  the  machine <period> he  had  a  wonderful  rapport <period> other  people  could  n't  get  the  machine  running <period> it  always  worked  for  him <period> even  errors  were  duplicated <period> dr.  barricelli  claims  machine  is  wrong <comma> code  is  right <period> so  he  designed  this  universe <comma> and  ran  it <period> when  the  bomb  people  went  home <comma> he  was  allowed  in  there <period> he  would  run  that  thing  all  night  long <comma> running  these  things <period> if  anybody  remembers  stephen  wolfram <comma> who  reinvented  this  stuff <period> and  he  published  it <period> it  was  n't  locked  up  and  disappeared <period> it  was  published  in  the  literature <period> if  it  's  that  easy  to  create  living  organisms <comma> why  not  create  a  few  yourself <questionmark> so <comma> he  decided  to  give  it  a  try <comma> to  start  this  artificial  biology  going  in  the  machines <period> and  he  found  all  these <comma> sort  of  -- <period> it  was  like  a  naturalist  coming  in  and  looking  at  this  tiny <comma> 5,000-byte  universe <comma> and  seeing  all  these  things  happening  that  we  see  in  the  outside  world <comma> in  biology <period> this  is  some  of  the  generations  of  his  universe <period> but  they  're  just  going  to  stay  numbers <period> they  're  not  going  to  become  organisms <period> they  have  to  have  something <period> you  have  a  genotype  and  you  have  to  have  a  phenotype <period> they  have  to  go  out  and  do  something <period> and  he  started  doing  that <period> started  giving  these  little  numerical  organisms  things  they  could  play  with  -- <period> playing  chess  with  other  machines  and  so  on <period> and  they  did  start  to  evolve <period> and  he  went  around  the  country  after  that <period> every  time  there  was  a  new <comma> fast  machine <comma> he  started  using  it <comma> and  saw  exactly  what  's  happening  now <period> that  the  programs <comma> instead  of  being  turned  off <comma> when  you  quit  the  program <comma> you'd  keep  running  and <comma> basically <comma> all  the  sorts  of  things  like  windows  is  doing <period> running  as  a  multi-cellular  organism  on  many  machines <period> he  envisioned  all  that  happening <period> and  he  saw  that  evolution  itself  was  an  intelligent  process <period> it  was  n't  any  sort  of  creator  intelligence <comma> but  the  thing  itself  was  a  giant  parallel  computation  that  would  have  some  intelligence <period> and  he  went  out  of  his  way  to  say  that  he  was  not  saying  this  was  lifelike <comma> or  a  new  kind  of  life <period> it  just  was  another  version  of  the  same  thing  happening <period> and  there  's  really  no  difference  between  what  he  was  doing  in  the  computer  and  what  nature  did  billions  of  years  ago <period> and  could  you  do  it  again  now <questionmark> so <comma> when  i  went  into  these  archives  looking  at  this  stuff <comma> lo  and  behold <comma> the  archivist  came  up  one  day <comma> saying <comma> i  think  we  found  another  box  that  had  been  thrown  out <period> and  it  was  his  universe  on  punch  cards <period> so  there  it  is <comma> 50  years  later <comma> sitting  there <comma> sort  of  suspended  animation <period> that  's  the  instructions  for  running  -- <period> this  is  actually  the  source  code  for  one  of  those  universes <comma> with  a  note  from  the  engineers  saying  they  're  having  some  problems <period> there  must  be  something  about  this  code  that  you  have  n't  explained  yet <period> and  i  think  that  's  really  the  truth <period> we  still  do  n't  understand  how  these  very  simple  instructions  can  lead  to  increasing  complexity <period> what  's  the  dividing  line  between  when  that  is  lifelike  and  when  it  really  is  alive <questionmark> these  cards <comma> now <comma> thanks  to  me  showing  up <comma> are  being  saved <period> and  the  question  is <comma> should  we  run  them  or  not <questionmark> you  know <comma> could  we  get  them  running <questionmark> do  you  want  to  let  it  loose  on  the  internet <questionmark> these  machines  would  think  they  -- <period> these  organisms <comma> if  they  came  back  to  life  now <comma> whether  they've  died  and  gone  to  heaven <comma> there  's  a  universe <period> my  laptop  is  10  thousand  million  times  the  size  of  the  universe  that  they  lived  in  when  barricelli  quit  the  project <period> he  was  thinking  far  ahead <comma> to  how  this  would  really  grow  into  a  new  kind  of  life <period> and  that  's  what  's  happening <period> when  juan  enriquez  told  us  about  these  12  trillion  bits  being  transferred  back  and  forth <comma> of  all  this  genomics  data  going  to  the  proteomics  lab <comma> that  's  what  barricelli  imagined <comma> that  this  digital  code  in  these  machines  is  actually  starting  to  code <comma> it  already  is  coding  from  nucleic  acids <period> we've  been  doing  that  since <comma> you  know <comma> since  we  started  pcr  and  synthesizing  small  strings  of  dna <period> and  real  soon <comma> we  're  actually  going  to  be  synthesizing  the  proteins <comma> and <comma> like  steve  showed  us <comma> that  just  opens  an  entirely  new  world <period> it  's  a  world  that  von  neumann  himself  envisioned <period> this  was  published  after  he  died <comma> his  sort  of  unfinished  notes  on  self-reproducing  machines <period> what  it  takes  to  get  the  machines  sort  of  jump-started  to  where  they  begin  to  reproduce <period> it  took  really  three  people <comma> barricelli  had  the  concept  of  the  code  as  a  living  thing <period> von  neumann  saw  how  you  could  build  the  machines  -- <period> that  now <comma> last  count <comma> four  million  of  these  von  neumann  machines  is  built  every  24  hours <period> and  julian  bigelow <comma> who  died  10  days  ago  -- <period> this  is  john  markoff  's  obituary  for  him  -- <period> he  was  the  important  missing  link <comma> the  engineer  who  came  in  and  knew  how  to  put  those  vacuum  tubes  together  and  make  it  work <period> and  all  our  computers  have <comma> inside  them <comma> the  copies  of  the  architecture  that  he  had  to  just  design  one  day <comma> sort  of  on  pencil  and  paper <period> and  we  owe  a  tremendous  credit  to  that <period> and  he  explained <comma> in  a  very  generous  way <comma> the  spirit  that  brought  all  these  different  people  to  the  institute  for  advanced  study  in  the  40s  to  do  this  project <comma> and  make  it  freely  available  with  no  patents <comma> no  restrictions <comma> no  intellectual  property  disputes  to  the  rest  of  the  world <period> that  's  the  last  entry  in  the  logbook  when  the  machine  was  shut  down <comma> july  1958 <period> and  it  's  julian  bigelow  who  was  running  it  until  midnight  when  the  machine  was  officially  turned  off <period> and  that  's  the  end <period> thank  you  very  much <period> i  was  thinking  about  my  place  in  the  universe <comma> and  about  my  first  thought  about  what  infinity  might  mean <comma> when  i  was  a  child <period> and  i  thought  that  if  time  could  reach  forwards  and  backwards  infinitely <comma> does  n't  that  mean  that  every  point  in  time  is  really  infinitely  small <comma> and  therefore  somewhat  meaningless <period> so  we  do  n't  really  have  a  place  in  the  universe <comma> as  far  as  on  a  time  line <period> but  nothing  else  does  either <period> therefore  every  moment  really  is  the  most  important  moment  that  's  ever  happened <comma> including  this  moment  right  now <period> and  so  therefore  this  music  you  're  about  to  hear  is  maybe  the  most  important  music  you  'll  ever  hear  in  your  life <period> thank  you <period> for  those  of  you  who  i  'll  be  fortunate  enough  to  meet  afterwards <comma> you  could  please  refrain  from  saying <comma> oh  my  god <comma> you  're  so  much  shorter  in  real  life <period> because  it  's  like  the  stage  is  an  optical  illusion <period> for  some  reason <period> somewhat  like  the  curving  of  the  universe <period> i  do  n't  know  what  it  is <period> i  get  asked  in  interviews  a  lot <comma> my  god <comma> you  're  guitars  are  so  gigantic <period> you  must  get  them  custom  made <comma> special <comma> humongous  guitars <period> thank  you  very  much <period> thomas  dolby <comma> for  pure  pleasure  please  welcome  the  lovely <comma> the  delectable <comma> and  the  bilingual  rachelle  garniez <period> rachelle  garniez <comma> quand  il  me  prend  dans  ses  bras  il  me  parle  tout  bas <comma> je  vois  la  vie  en  rose <period> il  me  dit  des  mots  d'amour <comma> des  mots  de  tous  les  jours <comma> et  ca  me  fait  quelque  chose <period> il  est  entre  dans  mon  coeur  une  part  de  bonheur  dont  je  connais  la  cause <period> c'est  lui  pour  moi <period> moi  pour  lui  dans  la  vie <comma> il  me  l'a  dit <comma> l'a  jure  pour  la  vie <period> et  des  que  je  l'apercois  alors  je  sens  en  moi  mon  coeur  qui  bat  /transcript <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  today  about  my  work  on  suspended  animation <period> now <comma> usually  when  i  mention  suspended  animation <comma> people  will  flash  me  the  vulcan  sign  and  laugh <period> but  now <comma> i  'm  not  talking  about  gorking  people  out  to  fly  to  mars  or  even  pandora <comma> as  much  fun  as  that  may  be <period> i  'm  talking  about  the  concept  of  using  suspended  animation  to  help  people  out  in  trauma <period> so  what  do  i  mean  when  i  say  suspended  animation <questionmark> it  is  the  process  by  which  animals  de-animate <comma> appear  dead  and  then  can  wake  up  again  without  being  harmed <period> ok <comma> so  here  is  the  sort  of  big  idea: <period> if  you  look  out  at  nature <comma> you  find  that  as  you  tend  to  see  suspended  animation <comma> you  tend  to  see  immortality <period> and  so <comma> what  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about  is  a  way  to  tell  a  person  who  's  in  trauma <comma> find  a  way  to  de-animate  them  a  bit  so  they  're  a  little  more  immortal  when  they  have  that  heart  attack <period> an  example  of  an  organism  or  two  that  happens  to  be  quite  immortal  would  be  plant  seeds  or  bacterial  spores <period> these  creatures  are  some  of  the  most  immortal  life  forms  on  our  planet <comma> and  they  tend  to  spend  most  of  their  time  in  suspended  animation <period> bacterial  spores  are  thought  now  by  scientists  to  exist  as  individual  cells  that  are  alive <comma> but  in  suspended  animation  for  as  long  as  250  million  years <period> to  suggest  that  this  all <comma> sort  of <comma> about  little <comma> tiny  creatures <comma> i  want  to  bring  it  close  to  home <period> in  the  immortal  germ  line  of  human  beings <comma> that  is <comma> the  eggs  that  sit  in  the  ovaries <comma> they  actually  sit  there  in  a  state  of  suspended  animation  for  up  to  50  years  in  the  life  of  each  woman <period> so  then  there  's  also  my  favorite  example  of  suspended  animation <period> this  is  sea-monkeys <period> those  of  you  with  children <comma> you  know  about  them <period> you  go  to  the  pet  store  or  the  toy  store <comma> and  you  can  buy  these  things <period> you  just  open  the  bag <comma> and  you  just  dump  them  into  the  plastic  aquarium <comma> and  in  about  a  week  or  so <comma> you  'll  have  little  shrimps  swimming  around <period> well <comma> i  was  n't  so  interested  in  the  swimming <period> i  was  interested  in  what  was  going  on  in  the  bag <comma> the  bag  on  the  toy  store  shelf  where  those  shrimp  sat  in  suspended  animation  indefinitely <period> so  these  ideas  of  suspended  animation  are  not  just  about  cells  and  weird <comma> little  organisms <period> occasionally <comma> human  beings  are  briefly  de-animated <comma> and  the  stories  of  people  who  are  briefly  de-animated  that  interest  me  the  most  are  those  having  to  do  with  the  cold <period> ten  years  ago <comma> there  was  a  skier  in  norway  that  was  trapped  in  an  icy  waterfall <period> and  she  was  there  for  two  hours  before  they  extracted  her <period> she  was  extremely  cold <comma> and  she  had  no  heartbeat  -- <period> for  all  intents  and  purposes  she  was  dead <comma> frozen <period> seven  hours  later <comma> still  without  a  heartbeat <comma> they  brought  her  back  to  life <comma> and  she  went  on  to  be  the  head  radiologist  in  the  hospital  that  treated  her <period> a  couple  of  years  later <comma> so  i  get  really  excited  about  these  things <comma> about  a  couple  of  years  later <comma> there  was  a  13-month-old <comma> she  was  from  canada <period> her  father  had  gone  out  in  the  wintertime <period> he  was  working  night  shift <comma> and  she  followed  him  outside  in  nothing  but  a  diaper <period> and  they  found  her  hours  later <comma> frozen <comma> lifeless <period> and  they  brought  her  back  to  life <period> there  was  a  65-year-old  woman  in  duluth <comma> minnesota  last  year  that  was  found  frozen  and  without  a  pulse  in  her  front  yard  one  morning  in  the  winter <comma> and  they  brought  her  back  to  life <period> the  next  day <comma> she  was  doing  so  well <comma> they  wanted  to  run  tests  on  her <period> she  got  cranky  and  just  went  home <period> so <comma> these  are  miracles <comma> right <questionmark> these  are  truly  miraculous  things  that  happen <period> doctors  have  a  saying  that <comma> in  fact <comma> you  're  not  dead  until  you  're  warm  and  dead <period> and  it  's  true <period> it  's  true <period> in  the  new  england  journal  of  medicine <comma> there  was  a  study  published  that  showed  that  with  appropriate  rewarming <comma> people  who  had  suffered  without  a  heartbeat  for  three  hours  could  be  brought  back  to  life  without  any  neurologic  problems <period> that  's  over  50  percent <period> so  what  i  was  trying  to  do  is  think  of  a  way  that  we  could  study  suspended  animation  to  think  about  a  way  to  reproduce <comma> maybe <comma> what  happened  to  the  skier <period> well <comma> i  have  to  tell  you  something  very  odd <comma> and  that  is  that  being  exposed  to  low  oxygen  does  not  always  kill <period> so <comma> in  this  room <comma> there  's  20  percent  oxygen  or  so <period> and  if  we  reduce  the  oxygen  concentration <comma> we  will  all  be  dead <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> the  animals  we  were  working  with  in  the  lab <comma> these  little  garden  worms <comma> nematodes <comma> they  were  also  dead  when  we  exposed  them  to  low  oxygen <period> and  here  's  the  thing  that  should  freak  you  out <period> and  that  is  that <comma> when  we  lower  the  oxygen  concentration  further  by  100  times <comma> to  10  parts  per  million <comma> they  were  not  dead <comma> they  were  in  suspended  animation <comma> and  we  could  bring  them  back  to  life  without  any  harm <period> and  this  precise  oxygen  concentration <comma> 10  parts  per  million <comma> that  caused  suspended  animation <comma> is  conserved <period> we  can  see  it  in  a  variety  of  different  organisms <period> one  of  the  creatures  we  see  it  in  is  a  fish <period> and  we  can  turn  its  heartbeat  on  and  off  by  going  in  and  out  of  suspended  animation  like  you  would  a  light  switch <period> so  this  was  pretty  shocking  to  me <comma> that  we  could  do  this <period> and  so  i  was  wondering <comma> when  we  were  trying  to  reproduce  the  work  with  the  skier <comma> that  we  noticed  that <comma> of  course <comma> she  had  no  oxygen  consumption <comma> and  so  maybe  she  was  in  a  similar  state  of  suspended  animation <period> but <comma> of  course <comma> she  was  also  extremely  cold <period> so  we  wondered  what  would  happen  if  we  took  our  suspended  animals  and  exposed  them  to  the  cold <period> and  so <comma> what  we  found  out  was  that <comma> if  you  take  animals  that  are  animated  like  you  and  i <comma> and  you  make  them  cold <comma> that  is <comma> these  were  the  garden  worms <comma> now  they  're  dead <period> but  if  you  have  them  in  suspended  animation <comma> and  move  them  into  the  cold <comma> they  're  all  alive <period> and  there  's  the  very  important  thing  there <comma> if  you  want  to  survive  the  cold <comma> you  ought  to  be  suspended <period> right <questionmark> it  's  a  really  good  thing <period> and  so <comma> we  were  thinking  about  that <comma> about  this  relationship  between  these  things <comma> and  thinking  about  whether  or  not  that  's  what  happened  to  the  skier <period> and  so  we  wondered <comma> might  there  be  some  agent  that  is  in  us <comma> something  that  we  make  ourselves <comma> that  we  might  be  able  to  regulate  our  own  metabolic  flexibility  in  such  a  way  as  to  be  able  to  survive  when  we  got  extremely  cold <comma> and  might  otherwise  pass  away <questionmark> i  thought  it  might  be  interesting  to  sort  of  hunt  for  such  things <period> you  know <questionmark> i  should  mention  briefly  here  that  physiology  textbooks  that  you  can  read  about  will  tell  you  that  this  is  a  kind  of  heretical  thing  to  suggest <period> we  have <comma> from  the  time  we  are  slapped  on  the  butt  until  we  take  our  last  dying  breath <comma> that  's  when  we  're  newborn  to  when  we  're  dead <comma> we  cannot  reduce  our  metabolic  rate  below  what  's  called  a  standard <comma> or  basal  metabolic  rate <period> but  i  knew  that  there  were  examples  of  creatures <comma> also  mammals <comma> that  do  reduce  their  metabolic  rate  such  as  ground  squirrels  and  bears <period> they  reduce  their  metabolic  rate  in  the  wintertime  when  they  hibernate <period> so  i  wondered <comma> might  we  be  able  to  find  some  agent  or  trigger  that  might  induce  such  a  state  in  us <questionmark> and  so <comma> we  went  looking  for  such  things <period> and  this  was  a  period  of  time  when  we  failed  tremendously <period> ken  robinson  is  here <period> he  talked  about  the  glories  of  failure <period> well <comma> we  had  a  lot  of  them <period> we  tried  many  different  chemicals  and  agents <comma> and  we  failed  over  and  over  again <period> so <comma> one  time <comma> i  was  at  home  watching  television  on  the  couch  while  my  wife  was  putting  our  child  to  bed <comma> and  i  was  watching  a  television  show <period> it  was  a  television  show <comma> it  was  a  nova  show  on  pbs <comma> about  caves  in  new  mexico <period> and  this  particular  cave  was  lechuguilla <comma> and  this  cave  is  incredibly  toxic  to  humans <period> the  researchers  had  to  suit  up  just  to  enter  it <period> it  's  filled  with  this  toxic  gas <comma> hydrogen  sulfide <period> now <comma> hydrogen  sulfide  is  curiously  present  in  us <period> we  make  it  ourselves <period> the  highest  concentration  is  in  our  brains <period> yet <comma> it  was  used  as  a  chemical  warfare  agent  in  world  war  i <period> it  's  an  extraordinarily  toxic  thing <period> in  fact <comma> in  chemical  accidents <comma> hydrogen  sulfide  is  known  to <comma> if  you  breathe  too  much  of  it <comma> you  collapse  to  the  ground <comma> you  appear  dead <comma> but  if  you  were  brought  out  into  room  air <comma> you  can  be  reanimated  without  harm <comma> if  they  do  that  quickly <period> so <comma> i  thought <comma> wow <comma> i  have  to  get  some  of  this <period> now <comma> it  's  post-9/11  america <comma> and  when  you  go  into  the  research  institute <comma> and  you  say <comma> hi <period> i'd  like  to  buy  some  concentrated <comma> compressed  gas  cylinders  of  a  lethal  gas  because  i  have  these  ideas <comma> see <comma> about  wanting  to  suspend  people <period> it  's  really  going  to  be  ok <period> so  that  's  kind  of  a  tough  day <comma> but  i  said <comma> there  really  is  some  basis  for  thinking  why  you  might  want  to  do  this <period> as  i  said <comma> this  agent  is  in  us <comma> and <comma> in  fact <comma> here  's  a  curious  thing <comma> it  binds  to  the  very  place  inside  of  your  cells  where  oxygen  binds <comma> and  where  you  burn  it <comma> and  that  you  do  this  burning  to  live <period> and  so  we  thought <comma> like  in  a  game  of  musical  chairs <comma> might  we  be  able  to  give  a  person  some  hydrogen  sulfide <comma> and  might  it  be  able  to  occupy  that  place  like  in  a  game  of  musical  chairs  where  oxygen  might  bind <questionmark> and  because  you  cannot  bind  the  oxygen <comma> maybe  you  would  n't  consume  it <comma> and  then  maybe  it  would  reduce  your  demand  for  oxygen <period> i  mean <comma> who  knows <questionmark> so <comma> so <comma> there  's  the  bit  about  the  dopamine  and  being  a  little  bit <comma> what  do  you  call  it <comma> delusional <comma> and  you  might  suggest  that  was  it <period> and  so <comma> we  wanted  to  find  out  might  we  be  able  to  use  hydrogen  sulfide  in  the  presence  of  cold <comma> and  we  wanted  to  see  whether  we  could  reproduce  this  skier  in  a  mammal <period> now <comma> mammals  are  warm-blooded  creatures <comma> and  when  we  get  cold <comma> we  shake  and  we  shiver <comma> right <questionmark> we  try  to  keep  our  core  temperature  at  37  degrees  by  actually  burning  more  oxygen <period> so <comma> it  was  interesting  for  us  when  we  applied  hydrogen  sulfide  to  a  mouse  when  it  was  also  cold  because  what  happened  is  the  core  temperature  of  the  mouse  got  cold <period> it  stopped  moving <period> it  appeared  dead <period> its  oxygen  consumption  rate  fell  by  tenfold <period> and  here  's  the  really  important  point <period> i  told  you  hydrogen  sulfide  is  in  us <period> it  's  rapidly  metabolized <comma> and  all  you  have  to  do  after  six  hours  of  being  in  this  state  of  de-animation  is  simply  put  the  thing  out  in  room  air <comma> and  it  warms  up <comma> and  it  's  none  the  worse  for  wear <period> now <comma> this  was  cosmic <period> really <period> because  we  had  found  a  way  to  de-animate  a  mammal <period> and  it  did  n't  hurt  it <period> now <comma> we'd  found  a  way  to  reduce  its  oxygen  consumption  to  rock-bottom  levels <comma> and  it  was  fine <period> now <comma> in  this  state  of  de-animation <comma> it  could  not  go  out  dancing <comma> but  it  was  not  dead <comma> and  it  was  not  harmed <period> so  we  started  to  think <comma> is  this  the  agent  that  might  have  been  present  in  the  skier <comma> and  might  have  she  had  more  of  it  than  someone  else <comma> and  might  that  have  been  able  to  reduce  her  demand  for  oxygen  before  she  got  so  cold  that  she  otherwise  would  have  died <comma> as  we  found  out  with  our  worm  experiments <questionmark> so <comma> we  wondered <comma> can  we  do  anything  useful  with  this  capacity  to  control  metabolic  flexibility <questionmark> and  one  of  the  things  we  wondered <comma> i  'm  sure  some  of  you  out  there  are  economists <comma> and  you  know  all  about  supply  and  demand <period> and  when  supply  is  equal  to  demand <comma> everything  's  fine <comma> but  when  supply  falls <comma> in  this  case  of  oxygen <comma> and  demand  stays  high <comma> you  're  dead <period> so <comma> what  i  just  told  you  is  we  can  now  reduce  demand <period> we  ought  to  be  able  to  lower  supply  to  unprecedented  low  levels  without  killing  the  animal <period> and  with  money  we  got  from  darpa <comma> we  could  show  just  that <period> if  you  give  mice  hydrogen  sulfide <comma> you  can  lower  their  demand  for  oxygen <comma> and  you  can  put  them  into  oxygen  concentrations  that  are  as  low  as  5,000  feet  above  the  top  of  mt <period> everest <comma> and  they  can  sit  there  for  hours <comma> and  there  's  no  problem <period> well  this  was  really  cool <period> we  also  found  out  that  we  could  subject  animals  to  otherwise  lethal  blood  loss <comma> and  we  could  save  them  if  we  gave  them  hydrogen  sulfide <period> so  these  proof  of  concept  experiments  led  me  to  say  i  should  found  a  company <comma> and  we  should  take  this  out  to  a  wider  playing  field <period> i  founded  a  company  called  ikaria  with  others  help <period> and  this  company <comma> the  first  thing  it  did  was  make  a  liquid  formulation  of  hydrogen  sulfide  and  send  it  out  to  physician  scientists  all  over  the  world  who  work  on  models  of  critical  care  medicine <comma> and  the  results  are  incredibly  positive <period> in  one  model  of  heart  attack <comma> animals  given  hydrogen  sulfide  showed  a  70  percent  reduction  in  heart  damage  compared  to  those  who  got  the  standard  of  care  that  you  and  i  would  receive  if  we  were  to  have  a  heart  attack  here  today <period> same  is  true  for  organ  failure <comma> when  you  have  loss  of  function  owing  to  poor  perfusion  of  kidney <comma> of  liver <comma> acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  and  damage  suffered  in  cardiac-bypass  surgery <period> so <comma> these  are  the  thought  leaders  in  trauma  medicine  all  over  the  world  saying  this  is  true <comma> so  it  seems  that  exposure  to  hydrogen  sulfide  decreases  damage  that  you  receive  from  being  exposed  to  otherwise  lethal-low  oxygen <period> and  i  should  say  that  the  concentrations  of  hydrogen  sulfide  required  to  get  this  benefit  are  low <comma> incredibly  low <period> in  fact <comma> so  low  that  physicians  will  not  have  to  lower  or  dim  the  metabolism  of  people  much  at  all  to  see  the  benefit  i  just  mentioned <comma> which  is  a  wonderful  thing <comma> if  you  're  thinking  about  adopting  this <period> you  do  n't  want  to  be  gorking  people  out  just  to  save  them <comma> it  's  really  confusing <period> so <comma> i  want  to  say  that  we  're  in  human  trials <period> now <comma> and  so <comma> thank  you <period> the  phase  1  safety  studies  are  over <comma> and  we  're  doing  fine <comma> we  're  now  moved  on <period> we  have  to  get  to  phase  2  and  phase  3 <period> it  's  going  to  take  us  a  few  years <period> this  has  all  moved  very  quickly <comma> and  the  mouse  experiments  of  hibernating  mice  happened  in  2005 <period> the  first  human  studies  were  done  in  2008 <comma> and  we  should  know  in  a  couple  of  years  whether  it  works  or  not <period> and  this  all  happened  really  quickly  because  of  a  lot  of  help  from  a  lot  of  people <period> i  want  to  mention  that <comma> first  of  all <comma> my  wife <comma> without  whom  this  talk  and  my  work  would  not  be  possible <comma> so  thank  you  very  much <period> also <comma> the  brilliant  scientists  who  work  at  my  lab  and  also  others  on  staff <comma> the  fred  hutchinson  cancer  research  center  in  seattle <comma> washington <comma> wonderful  place  to  work <period> and  also  the  wonderful  scientists  and  businesspeople  at  ikaria <period> one  thing  those  people  did  out  there  was  take  this  technology  of  hydrogen  sulfide <comma> which  is  this  start-up  company  that  's  burning  venture  capital  very  quickly <comma> and  they  fused  it  with  another  company  that  sells  another  toxic  gas  that  's  more  toxic  than  hydrogen  sulfide <comma> and  they  give  it  to  newborn  babies  who  would  otherwise  die  from  a  failure  to  be  able  to  oxygenate  their  tissues  properly <period> and  this  gas  that  is  delivered  in  over  a  thousand  critical  care  hospitals  worldwide <comma> now  is  approved <comma> on  label <comma> and  saves  thousands  of  babies  a  year  from  certain  death <period> so  it  's  really  incredible  for  me  to  be  a  part  of  this <period> and  i  want  to  say  that  i  think  we  're  on  the  path  of  understanding  metabolic  flexibility  in  a  fundamental  way <comma> and  that  in  the  not  too  distant  future <comma> an  emt  might  give  an  injection  of  hydrogen  sulfide <comma> or  some  related  compound <comma> to  a  person  suffering  severe  injuries <comma> and  that  person  might  de-animate  a  bit <comma> they  might  become  a  little  more  immortal <period> their  metabolism  will  fall  as  though  you  were  dimming  a  switch  on  a  lamp  at  home <period> and  then <comma> they  will  have  the  time <comma> that  will  buy  them  the  time <comma> to  be  transported  to  the  hospital  to  get  the  care  they  need <period> and  then <comma> after  they  get  that  care <comma> like  the  mouse <comma> like  the  skier <comma> like  the  65-year-old  woman <comma> they  'll  wake  up <period> a  miracle <questionmark> we  hope  not <comma> or  maybe  we  just  hope  to  make  miracles  a  little  more  common <period> thank  you  very  much <period> if  you  have  n't  ordered  yet <comma> i  generally  find  the  rigatoni  with  the  spicy  tomato  sauce  goes  best  with  diseases  of  the  small  intestine <period> so <comma> sorry <comma> it  just  feels  like  i  should  be  doing  stand-up  up  here  because  of  the  setting <period> no <comma> what  i  want  to  do  is  take  you  back  to  1854  in  london  for  the  next  few  minutes <comma> and  tell  the  story <comma> in  brief <comma> of  this  outbreak <comma> which  in  many  ways <comma> i  think <comma> helped  create  the  world  that  we  live  in  today <comma> and  particularly  the  kind  of  city  that  we  live  in  today <period> this  period  in  1854 <comma> in  the  middle  part  of  the  19th  century <comma> in  london  's  history <comma> is  incredibly  interesting  for  a  number  of  reasons <period> but  i  think  the  most  important  one  is  that  london  was  this  city  of  25  million  people <comma> and  it  was  the  largest  city  on  the  face  of  the  planet  at  that  point <period> but  it  was  also  the  largest  city  that  had  ever  been  built <period> and  so  the  victorians  were  trying  to  live  through  and  simultaneously  invent  a  whole  new  scale  of  living <comma> this  scale  of  living  that  we <comma> you  know <comma> now  call  metropolitan  living <period> and  it  was  in  many  ways <comma> at  this  point  in  the  mid-1850s <comma> a  complete  disaster <period> they  were  basically  a  city  living  with  a  modern  kind  of  industrial  metropolis  with  an  elizabethan  public  infrastructure <period> so  people <comma> for  instance <comma> just  to  gross  you  out  for  a  second <comma> had  cesspools  of  human  waste  in  their  basement <period> like <comma> a  foot  to  two  feet  deep <period> and  they  would  just  kind  of  throw  the  buckets  down  there  and  hope  that  it  would  somehow  go  away <comma> and  of  course  it  never  really  would  go  away <period> and  all  of  this  stuff <comma> basically <comma> had  accumulated  to  the  point  where  the  city  was  incredibly  offensive  to  just  walk  around  in <period> it  was  an  amazingly  smelly  city <period> not  just  because  of  the  cesspools <comma> but  also  the  sheer  number  of  livestock  in  the  city  would  shock  people <period> not  just  the  horses <comma> but  people  had  cows  in  their  attics  that  they  would  use  for  milk <comma> that  they  would  hoist  up  there  and  keep  them  in  the  attic  until  literally  their  milk  ran  out  and  they  died <comma> and  then  they  would  drag  them  off  to  the  bone  boilers  down  the  street <period> so <comma> you  would  just  walk  around  london  at  this  point  and  just  be  overwhelmed  with  this  stench <period> and  what  ended  up  happening  is  that  an  entire  emerging  public  health  system  became  convinced  that  it  was  the  smell  that  was  killing  everybody <comma> that  was  creating  these  diseases  that  would  wipe  through  the  city  every  three  or  four  years <period> and  cholera  was  really  the  great  killer  of  this  period <period> it  arrived  in  london  in  1832 <comma> and  every  four  or  five  years  another  epidemic  would  take  10,000 <comma> 20,000  people  in  london  and  throughout  the  uk <period> and  so  the  authorities  became  convinced  that  this  smell  was  this  problem <period> we  had  to  get  rid  of  the  smell <period> and  so <comma> in  fact <comma> they  concocted  a  couple  of  early <comma> you  know <comma> founding  public-health  interventions  in  the  system  of  the  city <comma> one  of  which  was  called  the  nuisances  act <comma> which  they  got  everybody  as  far  as  they  could  to  empty  out  their  cesspools  and  just  pour  all  that  waste  into  the  river <period> because  if  we  get  it  out  of  the  streets <comma> it  'll  smell  much  better <comma> and <comma> oh  right <comma> we  drink  from  the  river <period> so  what  ended  up  happening <comma> actually <comma> is  they  ended  up  increasing  the  outbreaks  of  cholera  because <comma> as  we  now  know <comma> cholera  is  actually  in  the  water <period> it  's  a  waterborne  disease <comma> not  something  that  's  in  the  air <period> it  's  not  something  you  smell  or  inhale <period> it  's  something  you  ingest <period> and  so  one  of  the  founding  moments  of  public  health  in  the  19th  century  effectively  poisoned  the  water  supply  of  london  much  more  effectively  than  any  modern  day  bioterrorist  could  have  ever  dreamed  of  doing <period> so  this  was  the  state  of  london  in  1854 <comma> and  in  the  middle  of  all  this  carnage  and  offensive  conditions <comma> and  in  the  midst  of  all  this  scientific  confusion  about  what  was  actually  killing  people <period> it  was  a  very  talented  classic  19th  century  multi-disciplinarian  named  john  snow <comma> who  was  a  local  doctor  in  soho  in  london <comma> who  had  been  arguing  for  about  four  or  five  years  that  cholera  was <comma> in  fact <comma> a  waterborne  disease <comma> and  had  basically  convinced  nobody  of  this <period> the  public  health  authorities  had  largely  ignored  what  he  had  to  say <period> and  he'd  made  the  case  in  a  number  of  papers  and  done  a  number  of  studies <comma> but  nothing  had  really  stuck <period> and  part  of <comma> what  's  so  interesting  about  this  story  to  me  is  that  in  some  ways <comma> it  's  a  great  case  study  in  how  cultural  change  happens <period> how  a  good  idea  eventually  comes  to  win  out  over  much  worse  ideas <period> and  snow  labored  for  a  long  time  with  this  great  insight  that  everybody  ignored <period> and  then  on  one  day <comma> august  28th  of  1854 <comma> a  young  child <comma> a  five-month-old  girl  whose  first  name  we  do  n't  know <comma> we  know  her  only  as  baby  lewis <comma> somehow  contracted  cholera <period> came  down  with  cholera  at  40  broad  street <period> you  cannot  really  see  it  in  this  map <comma> but  this  is  the  map  that  becomes  the  central  focus  in  the  second  half  of  my  book <period> it  's  in  the  middle  of  soho <comma> in  this  working  class  neighborhood <period> this  little  girl  becomes  sick  and  it  turns  out  that  the  cesspool <comma> that  they  still  continue  to  have <comma> despite  the  nuisances  act <comma> bordered  on  an  extremely  popular  water  pump <comma> local  watering  hole  that  was  well  known  for  the  best  water  in  all  of  soho <comma> that  all  the  residents  from  soho  and  the  surrounding  neighborhoods  would  go  to <period> and  so  this  little  girl  inadvertently  ended  up  contaminating  the  water  in  this  popular  pump <comma> and  one  of  the  most  terrifying  outbreaks  in  the  history  of  england  erupted  about  two  or  three  days  later <period> literally <comma> 10  percent  of  the  neighborhood  died  in  seven  days <comma> and  much  more  would  have  died  if  people  had  n't  fled  after  the  initial  outbreak  kicked  in <period> so  it  was  this  incredibly  terrifying  event <period> you  had  these  scenes  of  entire  families  dying  over  the  course  of  48  hours  of  cholera <comma> alone  in  their  one-room  apartments <comma> in  their  little  flats <period> just  an  extraordinary <comma> terrifying  scene <period> snow  lived  near  there <comma> heard  about  the  outbreak <comma> and  in  this  amazing  act  of  courage  went  directly  into  the  belly  of  the  beast  because  he  thought  an  outbreak  that  concentrated  could  actually  potentially  end  up  convincing  people  that <comma> in  fact <comma> the  real  menace  of  cholera  was  in  the  water  supply  and  not  in  the  air <period> he  suspected  an  outbreak  that  concentrated  would  probably  involve  a  single  point  source <period> one  single  thing  that  everybody  was  going  to  because  it  did  n't  have  the  traditional  slower  path  of  infections  that  you  might  expect <period> and  so  he  went  right  in  there  and  started  interviewing  people <period> he  eventually  enlisted  the  help  of  this  amazing  other  figure <comma> who  's  kind  of  the  other  protagonist  of  the  book  -- <period> this  guy <comma> henry  whitehead <comma> who  was  a  local  minister <comma> who  was  not  at  all  a  man  of  science <comma> but  was  incredibly  socially  connected <period> he  knew  everybody  in  the  neighborhood <period> and  he  managed  to  track  down <comma> whitehead  did <comma> many  of  the  cases  of  people  who  had  drunk  water  from  the  pump <comma> or  who  had  n't  drunk  water  from  the  pump <period> and  eventually  snow  made  a  map  of  the  outbreak <period> he  found  increasingly  that  people  who  drank  from  the  pump  were  getting  sick <period> people  who  had  n't  drunk  from  the  pump  were  not  getting  sick <period> and  he  thought  about  representing  that  as  a  kind  of  a  table  of  statistics  of  people  living  in  different  neighborhoods <comma> people  who  had  n't <comma> you  know <comma> percentages  of  people  who  had  n't <comma> but  eventually  he  hit  upon  the  idea  that  what  he  needed  was  something  that  you  could  see <period> something  that  would  take  in  a  sense  a  higher-level  view  of  all  this  activity  that  had  been  happening  in  the  neighborhood <period> and  so  he  created  this  map <comma> which  basically  ended  up  representing  all  the  deaths  in  the  neighborhoods  as  black  bars  at  each  address <period> and  you  can  see  in  this  map <comma> the  pump  right  at  the  center  of  it  and  you  can  see  that  one  of  the  residences  down  the  way  had  about  15  people  dead <period> and  the  map  is  actually  a  little  bit  bigger <period> as  you  get  further  and  further  away  from  the  pump <comma> the  deaths  begin  to  grow  less  and  less  frequent <period> and  so  you  can  see  this  something  poisonous  emanating  out  of  this  pump  that  you  could  see  in  a  glance <period> and  so <comma> with  the  help  of  this  map <comma> and  with  the  help  of  more  evangelizing  that  he  did  over  the  next  few  years  and  that  whitehead  did <comma> eventually <comma> actually <comma> the  authorities  slowly  started  to  come  around <period> it  took  much  longer  than  sometimes  we  like  to  think  in  this  story <comma> but  by  1866 <comma> when  the  next  big  cholera  outbreak  came  to  london <comma> the  authorities  had  been  convinced <comma> in  part  because  of  this  story <comma> in  part  because  of  this  map <comma> that  in  fact  the  water  was  the  problem <period> and  they  had  already  started  building  the  sewers  in  london <comma> and  they  immediately  went  to  this  outbreak  and  they  told  everybody  to  start  boiling  their  water <period> and  that  was  the  last  time  that  london  has  seen  a  cholera  outbreak  since <period> so <comma> part  of  this  story <comma> i  think <comma> well <comma> it  's  a  terrifying  story <comma> it  's  a  very  dark  story  and  it  's  a  story  that  continues  on  in  many  of  the  developing  cities  of  the  world <period> it  's  also  a  story  really  that  is  fundamentally  optimistic <comma> which  is  to  say  that  it  's  possible  to  solve  these  problems  if  we  listen  to  reason <comma> if  we  listen  to  the  kind  of  wisdom  of  these  kinds  of  maps <comma> if  we  listen  to  people  like  snow  and  whitehead <comma> if  we  listen  to  the  locals  who  understand  what  's  going  on  in  these  kinds  of  situations <period> and  what  it  ended  up  doing  is  making  the  idea  of  large-scale  metropolitan  living  a  sustainable  one <period> when  people  were  looking  at  10  percent  of  their  neighborhoods  dying  in  the  space  of  seven  days <comma> there  was  a  widespread  consensus  that  this  could  n't  go  on <comma> that  people  were  n't  meant  to  live  in  cities  of  25  million  people <period> but  because  of  what  snow  did <comma> because  of  this  map <comma> because  of  the  whole  series  of  reforms  that  happened  in  the  wake  of  this  map <comma> we  now  take  for  granted  that  cities  have  10  million  people <period> cities  like  this  one  are  in  fact  sustainable  things <period> we  do  n't  worry  that  new  york  city  is  going  to  collapse  in  on  itself  quite  the  way  that <comma> you  know <comma> rome  did <comma> and  be  10  percent  of  its  size  in  100  years  or  200  years <period> and  so  that  in  a  way  is  the  ultimate  legacy  of  this  map <period> it  's  a  map  of  deaths  that  ended  up  creating  a  whole  new  way  of  life <comma> the  life  that  we  're  enjoying  here  today <period> thank  you  very  much <period> unless  we  do  something  to  prevent  it <comma> over  the  next  40  years  we're  facing  an  epidemic  of  neurologic  diseases  on  a  global  scale <period> a  cheery  thought <period> on  this  map <comma> every  country  that's  colored  blue  has  more  than  20  percent  of  its  population  over  the  age  of  65 <period> this  is  the  world  we  live  in <period> and  this  is  the  world  your  children  will  live  in <period> for  12,000  years <comma> the  distribution  of  ages  in  the  human  population  has  looked  like  a  pyramid <comma> with  the  oldest  on  top <period> it's  already  flattening  out <period> by  2050 <comma> it's  going  to  be  a  column  and  will  start  to  invert <period> this  is  why  it's  happening <period> the  average  lifespan's  more  than  doubled  since  1840 <comma> and  it's  increasing  currently  at  the  rate  of  about  five  hours  every  day <period> and  this  is  why  that's  not  entirely  a  good  thing <comma> because  over  the  age  of  65 <comma> your  risk  of  getting  alzheimer's  or  parkinson's  disease  will  increase  exponentially <period> by  2050 <comma> there'll  be  about  32  million  people  in  the  united  states  over  the  age  of  80 <comma> and  unless  we  do  something  about  it <comma> half  of  them  will  have  alzheimer's  disease  and  three  million  more  will  have  parkinson's  disease <period> right  now <comma> those  and  other  neurologic  diseases <comma> for  which  we  have  no  cure  or  prevention <comma> cost  about  a  third  of  a  trillion  dollars  a  year <period> it  will  be  well  over  a  trillion  dollars  by  2050 <period> alzheimer's  disease  starts  when  a  protein  that  should  be  folded  up  properly  misfolds  into  a  kind  of  demented  origami <period> so  one  approach  we're  taking  is  to  try  to  design  drugs  that  function  like  molecular  scotch  tape <comma> to  hold  the  protein  into  its  proper  shape <period> that  would  keep  it  from  forming  the  tangles  that  seem  to  kill  large  sections  of  the  brain  when  they  do <period> interestingly  enough <comma> other  neurologic  diseases  which  affect  very  different  parts  of  the  brain  also  show  tangles  of  misfolded  protein <comma> which  suggests  that  the  approach  might  be  a  general  one <comma> and  might  be  used  to  cure  many  neurologic  diseases <comma> not  just  alzheimer's  disease <period> there's  also  a  fascinating  connection  to  cancer  here <comma> because  people  with  neurologic  diseases  have  a  very  low  incidence  of  most  cancers <period> and  this  is  a  connection  that  most  people  aren't  pursuing  right  now <comma> but  which  we're  fascinated  by <period> most  of  the  important  and  all  of  the  creative  work  in  this  area  is  being  funded  by  private  philanthropies <period> and  there's  tremendous  scope  for  additional  private  help  here <comma> because  the  government  has  dropped  the  ball  on  much  of  this <comma> i'm  afraid <period> in  the  meantime <comma> while  we're  waiting  for  all  these  things  to  happen <comma> here's  what  you  can  do  for  yourself <period> if  you  want  to  lower  your  risk  of  parkinson's  disease <comma> caffeine  is  protective  to  some  extent <period> nobody  knows  why <period> head  injuries  are  bad  for  you <period> they  lead  to  parkinson's  disease <period> and  the  avian  flu  is  also  not  a  good  idea <period> as  far  as  protecting  yourself  against  alzheimer's  disease <comma> well <comma> it  turns  out  that  fish  oil  has  the  effect  of  reducing  your  risk  for  alzheimer's  disease <period> you  should  also  keep  your  blood  pressure  down <comma> because  chronic  high  blood  pressure  is  the  biggest  single  risk  factor  for  alzheimer's  disease <period> it's  also  the  biggest  risk  factor  for  glaucoma <comma> which  is  just  alzheimer's  disease  of  the  eye <period> and  of  course <comma> when  it  comes  to  cognitive  effects <comma> use  it  or  lose  it  applies <comma> so  you  want  to  stay  mentally  stimulated <period> but  hey <comma> you're  listening  to  me <period> so  you've  got  that  covered <period> and  one  final  thing <period> wish  people  like  me  luck <comma> okay <questionmark> because  the  clock  is  ticking  for  all  of  us <period> thank  you <period> we  look  around  the  media <comma> as  we  see  on  the  news  from  iraq <comma> afghanistan <comma> sierra  leone <comma> and  the  conflict  seems  incomprehensible  to  us <period> and  that  's  certainly  how  it  seemed  to  me  when  i  started  this  project <period> but  as  a  physicist <comma> i  thought <comma> well  if  you  give  me  some  data <comma> i  could  maybe  understand  this <period> you  know <comma> give  us  a  go <period> so  as  a  naive  new  zealander  i  thought <comma> well  i  'll  go  to  the  pentagon <period> can  you  get  me  some  information <questionmark> no <period> so  i  had  to  think  a  little  harder <period> and  i  was  watching  the  news  one  night  in  oxford <period> and  i  looked  down  at  the  chattering  heads  on  my  channel  of  choice <period> and  i  saw  that  there  was  information  there <period> there  was  data  within  the  streams  of  news  that  we  consume <period> all  this  noise  around  us  actually  has  information <period> so  what  i  started  thinking  was <comma> perhaps  there  is  something  like  open  source  intelligence  here <period> if  we  can  get  enough  of  these  streams  of  information  together <comma> we  can  perhaps  start  to  understand  the  war <period> so  this  is  exactly  what  i  did <period> we  started  bringing  a  team  together <comma> an  interdisciplinary  team  of  scientists <comma> of  economists <comma> mathematicians <period> we  brought  these  guys  together  and  we  started  to  try  and  solve  this <period> we  did  it  in  three  steps <period> the  first  step  we  did  was  to  collect <period> we  did  130  different  sources  of  information <comma> from  ngo  reports  to  newspapers  and  cable  news <period> we  brought  this  raw  data  in  and  we  filtered  it <period> we  extracted  the  key  bits  on  information  to  build  the  database <period> that  database  contained  the  timing  of  attacks <comma> the  location <comma> the  size  and  the  weapons  used <period> it  's  all  in  the  streams  of  information  we  consume  daily <comma> we  just  have  to  know  how  to  pull  it  out <period> and  once  we  had  this  we  could  start  doing  some  cool  stuff <period> what  if  we  were  to  look  at  the  distribution  of  the  sizes  of  attacks <questionmark> what  would  that  tell  us <questionmark> so  we  started  doing  this <period> and  you  can  see  here  on  the  horizontal  axis  you've  got  the  number  of  people  killed  in  an  attack  or  the  size  of  the  attack <period> and  on  the  vertical  axis  you've  got  the  number  of  attacks <period> so  we  plot  data  for  sample  on  this <period> you  see  some  sort  of  random  distribution <comma> perhaps  67  attacks <comma> one  person  was  killed <comma> or  47  attacks  where  seven  people  were  killed <period> we  did  this  exact  same  thing  for  iraq <period> and  we  did  n't  know <comma> for  iraq  what  we  were  going  to  find <period> it  turns  out  what  we  found  was  pretty  surprising <period> you  take  all  of  the  conflict <comma> all  of  the  chaos <comma> all  of  the  noise <comma> and  out  of  that  comes  this  precise  mathematical  distribution  of  the  way  attacks  are  ordered  in  this  conflict <period> this  blew  our  mind <period> why  should  a  conflict  like  iraq  have  this  as  its  fundamental  signature <questionmark> why  should  there  be  order  in  war <questionmark> we  did  n't  really  understand  that <period> we  thought  maybe  there  is  something  special  about  iraq <period> so  we  looked  at  a  few  more  conflicts <period> we  looked  at  colombia <comma> we  looked  at  afghanistan <comma> and  we  looked  at  senegal <period> and  the  same  pattern  emerged  in  each  conflict <period> this  was  n't  supposed  to  happen <period> these  are  different  wars <comma> with  different  religious  factions <comma> different  political  factions <comma> and  different  socioeconomic  problems <period> and  yet  the  fundamental  patterns  underlying  them  are  the  same <period> so  we  went  a  little  wider <period> we  looked  around  the  world  at  all  the  data  we  could  get  our  hands  on <period> from  peru  to  indonesia <comma> we  studied  this  same  pattern  again <period> and  we  found  that  not  only  were  the  distributions  these  straight  lines <comma> but  the  slope  of  these  lines <comma> they  clustered  around  this  value  of  alpha  equals  25 <period> and  we  could  generate  an  equation  that  could  predict  the  likelihood  of  an  attack <period> what  we  're  saying  here  is  the  probability  of  an  attack  killing  x  number  of  people  in  a  country  like  iraq  is  equal  to  a  constant <comma> times  the  size  of  that  attack <comma> raised  to  the  power  of  negative  alpha <period> and  negative  alpha  is  the  slope  of  that  line  i  showed  you  before <period> so  what <questionmark> this  is  data <comma> statistics <period> what  does  it  tell  us  about  these  conflicts <questionmark> that  was  a  challenge  we  had  to  face  as  physicists <period> how  do  we  explain  this <questionmark> and  what  we  really  found  was  that  alpha <comma> if  we  think  about  it <comma> is  the  organizational  structure  of  the  insurgency <period> alpha  is  the  distribution  of  the  sizes  of  attacks <comma> which  is  really  the  distribution  of  the  group  strength  carrying  out  the  attacks <period> so  we  look  at  a  process  of  group  dynamics <comma> coalescence  and  fragmentation <period> groups  coming  together <comma> groups  breaking  apart <period> and  we  start  running  the  numbers  on  this <period> can  we  simulate  it <questionmark> can  we  create  the  kind  of  patterns  that  we  're  seeing  in  places  like  iraq <questionmark> turns  out  we  kind  of  do  a  reasonable  job <period> we  can  run  these  simulations <period> we  can  recreate  this  using  a  process  of  group  dynamics  to  explain  the  patterns  that  we  see  all  around  the  conflicts  around  the  world <period> so  what  's  going  on <questionmark> why  should  these  different <comma> seemingly  different  conflicts  have  the  same  patterns <questionmark> now  what  i  believe  is  going  on  is  that  the  insurgent  forces <comma> they  evolve  over  time <period> they  adapt <period> and  it  turns  out  there  is  only  one  solution  to  fight  a  much  stronger  enemy <period> and  if  you  do  n't  find  that  solution  as  an  insurgent  force <comma> you  do  n't  exist <period> so  every  insurgent  force  that  is  ongoing <comma> every  conflict  that  is  ongoing <comma> it  's  going  to  look  something  like  this <period> and  that  is  what  we  think  is  happening <period> taking  it  forward <comma> how  do  we  change  it <questionmark> how  do  we  end  a  war  like  iraq <questionmark> what  does  it  look  like <questionmark> alpha  is  the  structure <period> it  's  got  a  stable  state  at  25 <period> this  is  what  wars  look  like  when  they  continue <period> we've  got  to  change  that <period> we  can  push  it  up: <period> the  forces  become  more  fragmented <period> there  is  more  of  them <comma> but  they  are  weaker <period> or  we  push  it  down: <period> they  're  more  robust <period> there  is  less  groups <period> but  perhaps  you  can  sit  and  talk  to  them <period> so  this  graph  here <comma> i  'm  going  to  show  you  now <period> no  one  has  seen  this  before <period> this  is  literally  stuff  that  we've  come  through  last  week <period> and  we  see  the  evolution  of  alpha  through  time <period> we  see  it  start <period> and  we  see  it  grow  up  to  the  stable  state  the  wars  around  the  world  look  like <period> and  it  stays  there  through  the  invasion  of  fallujah  until  the  samarra  bombings  in  the  iraqi  elections  of  06 <period> and  the  system  gets  perturbed <period> it  moves  upwards  to  a  fragmented  state <period> this  is  when  the  surge  happens <period> and  depending  on  who  you  ask <comma> the  surge  was  supposed  to  push  it  up  even  further <period> the  opposite  happened <period> the  groups  became  stronger <period> they  became  more  robust <period> and  so  i  'm  thinking <comma> right <comma> great <comma> it  's  going  to  keep  going  down <period> we  can  talk  to  them <period> we  can  get  a  solution <period> the  opposite  happened <period> it  's  moved  up  again <period> the  groups  are  more  fragmented <period> and  this  tells  me  one  of  two  things <period> either  we  're  back  where  we  started  and  the  surge  has  had  no  effect <period> or  finally  the  groups  have  been  fragmented  to  the  extent  that  we  can  start  to  think  about  maybe  moving  out <period> i  do  n't  know  what  the  answer  is  to  that <period> but  i  know  that  we  should  be  looking  at  the  structure  of  the  insurgency  to  answer  that  question <period> thank  you <period> thank  you  for  putting  up  these  pictures  of  my  colleagues  over  here <period> we  'll  be  talking  about  them <period> now <comma> i  'm  going  try  an  experiment <period> i  do  n't  do  experiments <comma> normally <period> i  'm  a  theorist <period> but  i  'm  going  see  what  happens  if  i  press  this  button <period> sure  enough <period> ok <period> i  used  to  work  in  this  field  of  elementary  particles <period> what  happens  to  matter  if  you  chop  it  up  very  fine <questionmark> what  is  it  made  of <questionmark> and  the  laws  of  these  particles  are  valid  throughout  the  universe <comma> and  they  're  very  much  connected  with  the  history  of  the  universe <period> we  know  a  lot  about  four  forces <period> there  must  be  a  lot  more <comma> but  those  are  at  very <comma> very  small  distances <comma> and  we  have  n't  really  interacted  with  them  very  much  yet <period> the  main  thing  i  want  to  talk  about  is  this <comma> that  we  have  this  remarkable  experience  in  this  field  of  fundamental  physics  that  beauty  is  a  very  successful  criterion  for  choosing  the  right  theory <period> and  why  on  earth  could  that  be  so <questionmark> well <comma> here  's  an  example  from  my  own  experience <period> it  's  fairly  dramatic <comma> actually <comma> to  have  this  happen <period> three  or  four  of  us <comma> in  1957 <comma> put  forward  a  partially  complete  theory  of  one  of  these  forces <comma> this  weak  force <period> and  it  was  in  disagreement  with  seven <comma> seven <comma> count  them <comma> seven  experiments <period> experiments  were  all  wrong <period> and  we  published  before  knowing  that <comma> because  we  figured  it  was  so  beautiful <comma> it  's  gotta  be  right <period> the  experiments  had  to  be  wrong <comma> and  they  were <period> now  our  friend  over  there <comma> albert  einstein <comma> used  to  pay  very  little  attention  when  people  said <comma> you  know <comma> there  's  a  man  with  an  experiment  that  seems  to  disagree  with  special  relativity <period> dc  miller <period> what  about  that  and  he  would  say <comma> aw <comma> that  'll  go  away  now <comma> why  does  stuff  like  that  work <questionmark> that  's  the  question <period> now <comma> yeah <comma> what  do  we  mean  by  beautiful <questionmark> that  's  one  thing <period> i  'll  try  to  make  that  clear <comma> partially  clear <period> why  should  it  work <comma> and  is  this  something  to  do  with  human  beings <questionmark> i  'll  let  you  in  on  the  answer  to  the  last  one  that  i  offer <period> and  that  is <comma> it  has  nothing  to  do  with  human  beings <period> somewhere  in  some  other  planet <comma> orbiting  some  very  distant  star <comma> maybe  in  a  another  galaxy <comma> there  could  well  be  entities  that  are  at  least  as  intelligent  as  we  are <comma> and  are  interested  in  science <period> it  's  not  impossible <period> i  think  there  probably  are  lots <period> very  likely <comma> none  is  close  enough  to  interact  with  us <period> but  they  could  be  out  there <comma> very  easily <period> and  suppose  they  have <comma> you  know <comma> very  different  sensory  apparatus <comma> and  so  on <period> they  have  seven  tentacles <comma> and  they  have  14  little  funny-looking  compound  eyes <comma> and  a  brain  shaped  like  a  pretzel <period> would  they  really  have  different  laws <questionmark> there  are  lots  of  people  who  believe  that <comma> and  i  think  it  is  utter  baloney <period> i  think  there  are  laws  out  there <comma> and  we  of  course  do  n't  understand  them  at  any  given  time  very  well <comma> but  we  try <period> and  we  try  to  get  closer  and  closer <period> and  someday <comma> we  may  actually  figure  out  the  fundamental  unified  theory  of  the  particles  and  forces <comma> what  i  call  the  fundamental  law  we  may  not  even  be  terribly  far  from  it <period> but  even  if  we  do  n't  run  across  it  in  our  lifetimes <comma> we  can  still  think  there  is  one  out  there <comma> and  we  're  just  trying  to  get  closer  and  closer  to  it <period> i  think  that  's  the  main  point  to  be  made <period> we  express  these  things  mathematically <period> and  when  the  mathematics  is  very  simple <comma> when  in  terms  of  some  mathematical  notation <comma> you  can  write  the  theory  in  a  very  brief  space <comma> without  a  lot  of  complication <comma> that  's  essentially  what  we  mean  by  beauty  or  elegance <period> here  's  what  i  was  saying  about  the  laws <period> they  're  really  there <period> newton  certainly  believed  that <period> and  he  said <comma> here <comma> it  is  the  business  of  natural  philosophy  to  find  out  those  laws  the  basic  law <comma> let  's  say <comma> here  's  an  assumption <period> the  assumption  is  that  the  basic  law  really  takes  the  form  of  a  unified  theory  of  all  the  particles <period> now <comma> some  people  call  that  a  theory  of  everything <period> that  's  wrong  because  the  theory  is  quantum  mechanical <period> and  i  wo  n't  go  into  a  lot  of  stuff  about  quantum  mechanics  and  what  it  's  like <comma> and  so  on <period> you've  heard  a  lot  of  wrong  things  about  it  anyway <period> there  are  even  movies  about  it  with  a  lot  of  wrong  stuff <period> but  the  main  thing  here  is  that  it  predicts  probabilities <period> now <comma> sometimes  those  probabilities  are  near  certainties <period> and  in  a  lot  of  familiar  cases <comma> they  of  course  are <period> but  other  times  they  're  not <comma> and  you  have  only  probabilities  for  different  outcomes <period> so  what  that  means  is  that  the  history  of  the  universe  is  not  determined  just  by  the  fundamental  law <period> it  's  the  fundamental  law  and  this  incredibly  long  series  of  accidents <comma> or  chance  outcomes <comma> that  are  there  in  addition <period> and  the  fundamental  theory  does  n't  include  those  chance  outcomes <period> they  are  in  addition <period> so  it  's  not  a  theory  of  everything <period> and  in  fact <comma> a  huge  amount  of  the  information  in  the  universe  around  us  comes  from  those  accidents <comma> and  not  just  from  the  fundamental  laws <period> now <comma> it  's  often  said  that  getting  closer  and  closer  to  the  fundamental  laws  by  examining  phenomena  at  low  energies <comma> and  then  higher  energies <comma> and  then  higher  energies <comma> or  short  distances <comma> and  then  shorter  distances <comma> and  then  still  shorter  distances <comma> and  so  on <comma> is  like  peeling  the  skin  of  an  onion <period> and  we  keep  doing  that <comma> and  build  more  powerful  machines <comma> accelerators  for  particles <period> we  look  deeper  and  deeper  into  the  structure  of  particles <comma> and  in  that  way  we  get  probably  closer  and  closer  to  this  fundamental  law <period> now <comma> what  happens  is  that  as  we  do  that <comma> as  we  peel  these  skins  of  the  onion <comma> and  we  get  closer  and  closer  to  the  underlying  law <comma> we  see  that  each  skin  has  something  in  common  with  the  previous  one <comma> and  with  the  next  one <period> we  write  them  out  mathematically <comma> and  we  see  they  use  very  similar  mathematics <period> they  require  very  similar  mathematics <period> that  is  absolutely  remarkable <comma> and  that  is  a  central  feature  of  what  i  'm  trying  to  say  today <period> newton  called  it <comma> that  's  newton <comma> by  the  way <comma> that  one <period> this  one  is  albert  einstein <period> hi <comma> al <period> and  anyway <comma> he  said <comma> nature  conformable  to  herself <comma> personifying  nature  as  a  female <period> and  so  what  happens  is  that  the  new  phenomena <comma> the  new  skins <comma> the  inner  skins  of  the  slightly  smaller  skins  of  the  onion  that  we  get  to <comma> resemble  the  slightly  larger  ones <period> and  the  kind  of  mathematics  that  we  had  for  the  previous  skin  is  almost  the  same  as  what  we  need  for  the  next  skin <period> and  that  's  why  the  equations  look  so  simple <period> because  they  use  mathematics  we  already  have <period> a  trivial  example  is  this <comma> newton  found  the  law  of  gravity <comma> which  goes  like  one  over  the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  things  gravitated <period> coulomb <comma> in  france <comma> found  the  same  law  for  electric  charges <period> here  's  an  example  of  this  similarity <period> you  look  at  gravity <comma> you  see  a  certain  law <period> then  you  look  at  electricity <period> sure  enough <period> the  same  rule <period> it  's  a  very  simple  example <period> there  are  lots  of  more  sophisticated  examples <period> symmetry  is  very  important  in  this  discussion <period> you  know  what  it  means <period> a  circle <comma> for  example <comma> is  symmetric  under  rotations  about  the  center  of  the  circle <period> you  rotate  around  the  center  of  the  circle <comma> the  circle  remains  unchanged <period> you  take  a  sphere <comma> in  three  dimensions <comma> you  rotate  around  the  center  of  the  sphere <comma> and  all  those  rotations  leave  the  sphere  alone <period> they  are  symmetries  of  the  sphere <period> so  we  say <comma> in  general <comma> that  there  's  a  symmetry  under  certain  operations  if  those  operations  leave  the  phenomenon <comma> or  its  description <comma> unchanged <period> maxwell  's  equations  are  of  course  symmetrical  under  rotations  of  all  of  space <period> does  n't  matter  if  we  turn  the  whole  of  space  around  by  some  angle <comma> it  does  n't  leave  the <comma> does  n't  change  the  phenomenon  of  electricity  or  magnetism <period> there  's  a  new  notation  in  the  19th  century  that  expressed  this <comma> and  if  you  use  that  notation <comma> the  equations  get  a  lot  simpler <period> then  einstein <comma> with  his  special  theory  of  relativity <comma> looked  at  a  whole  set  of  symmetries  of  maxwell  's  equations <comma> which  are  called  special  relativity <period> and  those  symmetries <comma> then <comma> make  the  equations  even  shorter <comma> and  even  prettier <comma> therefore <period> let  's  look <period> you  do  n't  have  to  know  what  these  things  mean <comma> does  n't  make  any  difference <period> but  you  can  just  look  at  the  form <period> you  can  look  at  the  form <period> you  see  above <comma> at  the  top <comma> a  long  list  of  equations  with  three  components  for  the  three  directions  of  space <comma> x <comma> y  and  z <period> then <comma> using  vector  analysis <comma> you  use  rotational  symmetry <comma> and  you  get  this  next  set <period> then  you  use  the  symmetry  of  special  relativity  and  you  get  an  even  simpler  set  down  here <comma> showing  that  symmetry  exhibits  better  and  better <period> the  more  and  more  symmetry  you  have <comma> the  better  you  exhibit  the  simplicity  and  elegance  of  the  theory <period> the  last  two <comma> the  first  equation  says  that  electric  charges  and  currents  give  rise  to  all  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields <period> the  next <comma> second <comma> equation  says  that  there  is  no  magnetism  other  than  that <period> the  only  magnetism  comes  from  electric  charges  and  currents <period> someday  we  may  find  some  slight  hole  in  that  argument <period> but  for  the  moment <comma> that  's  the  case <period> now <comma> here  is  a  very  exciting  development  that  many  people  have  not  heard  of <period> they  should  have  heard  of  it <comma> but  it  's  a  little  tricky  to  explain  in  technical  detail <comma> so  i  wo  n't  do  it <period> i  'll  just  mention  it <period> but  chen  ning  yang <comma> called  by  us  frank  yang <comma> and  bob  mills  put  forward <comma> 50  years  ago <comma> this  generalization  of  maxwell  's  equations <comma> with  a  new  symmetry <period> a  whole  new  symmetry <period> mathematics  very  similar <comma> but  there  was  a  whole  new  symmetry <period> they  hoped  that  this  would  contribute  somehow  to  particle  physics <comma> did  n't <period> it  did  n't <comma> by  itself <comma> contribute  to  particle  physics <period> but  then  some  of  us  generalized  it  further <period> and  then  it  did <period> and  it  gave  a  very  beautiful  description  of  the  strong  force  and  of  the  weak  force <period> so  here  we  say <comma> again <comma> what  we  said  before <comma> that  each  skin  of  the  onion  shows  a  similarity  to  the  adjoining  skins <period> so  the  mathematics  for  the  adjoining  skins  is  very  similar  to  what  we  need  for  the  new  one <period> and  therefore  it  looks  beautiful <period> because  we  already  know  how  to  write  it  in  a  lovely <comma> concise  way <period> so  here  are  the  themes <period> we  believe  there  is  a  unified  theory  underlying  all  the  regularities <period> steps  toward  unification  exhibit  the  simplicity <period> symmetry  exhibits  the  simplicity <period> and  then  there  is  self-similarity  across  the  scales <comma> in  other  words <comma> from  one  skin  of  the  onion  to  another  one <period> proximate  self-similarity <period> and  that  accounts  for  this  phenomenon <period> that  will  account  for  why  beauty  is  a  successful  criterion  for  selecting  the  right  theory <period> here  's  what  newton  himself  said <comma> nature  is  very  consonant  and  conformable  to  her  self  one  thing  he  was  thinking  of  is  something  that  most  of  us  take  for  granted  today <comma> but  in  his  day  it  was  n't  taken  for  granted <period> there  's  the  story <comma> which  is  not  absolutely  certain  to  be  right <comma> but  a  lot  of  people  told  it <period> four  sources  told  it <period> that  when  they  had  the  plague  in  cambridge <comma> and  he  went  down  to  his  mother  's  farm <comma> because  the  university  was  closed <comma> he  saw  an  apple  fall  from  a  tree <comma> or  on  his  head  or  something <period> and  he  realized  suddenly  that  the  force  that  drew  the  apple  down  to  the  earth  could  be  the  same  as  the  force  regulating  the  motions  of  the  planets  and  the  moon <period> that  was  a  big  unification  for  those  days <comma> although  today  we  take  it  for  granted <period> it  's  the  same  theory  of  gravity <period> so  he  said  that  this  principle  of  nature <comma> consonance <comma> this  principle  of  nature  being  very  remote  from  the  conceptions  of  philosophers <comma> i  forbore  to  describe  it  in  that  book <comma> lest  i  should  be  accounted  an  extravagant  freak <period> that  's  what  we  all  have  to  watch  out  for <comma> especially  at  this  meeting <period> and  so  prejudice  my  readers  against  all  those  things  which  were  the  main  design  of  the  book  now <comma> who  today  would  claim  that  as  a  mere  conceit  of  the  human  mind <questionmark> that  the  force  that  causes  the  apple  to  fall  to  the  ground  is  the  same  force  that  causes  the  planets  and  the  moon  to  move  around <comma> and  so  on <questionmark> everybody  knows  that <period> it  's  a  property  of  gravitation <period> it  's  not  something  in  the  human  mind <period> the  human  mind  can <comma> of  course <comma> appreciate  it  and  enjoy  it <comma> use  it <comma> but  it  's  not <comma> it  does  n't  stem  from  the  human  mind <period> it  stems  from  the  character  of  gravity <period> and  that  's  true  of  all  the  things  we  're  talking  about <period> they  are  properties  of  the  fundamental  law <period> the  fundamental  law  is  such  that  the  different  skins  of  the  onion  resemble  one  another <comma> and  therefore  the  math  for  one  skin  allows  you  to  express  beautifully  and  simply  the  phenomenon  of  the  next  skin <period> i  say  here  that  newton  did  a  lot  of  things  that  year <comma> gravity <comma> the  laws  of  motion <comma> the  calculus <comma> white  light  composed  of  all  the  colors  of  the  rainbow <period> and  he  could  have  written  quite  an  essay  on  what  i  did  over  my  summer  vacation <period> so  we  do  n't  have  to  assume  these  principles  as  separate  metaphysical  postulates <period> they  follow  from  the  fundamental  theory <period> they  are  what  we  call  emergent  properties <period> you  do  n't  need <comma> you  do  n't  need  something  more  to  get  something  more <period> that  's  what  emergence  means <period> life  can  emerge  from  physics  and  chemistry <comma> plus  a  lot  of  accidents <period> the  human  mind  can  arise  from  neurobiology  and  a  lot  of  accidents <comma> the  way  the  chemical  bond  arises  from  physics  and  certain  accidents <period> it  does  n't  diminish  the  importance  of  these  subjects  to  know  that  they  follow  from  more  fundamental  things <comma> plus  accidents <period> that  's  a  general  rule <comma> and  it  's  critically  important  to  realize  that <period> you  do  n't  need  something  more  in  order  to  get  something  more <period> people  keep  asking  that  when  they  read  my  book <comma> the  quark  and  the  jaguar <period> and  they  say <comma> is  n't  there  something  more  beyond  what  you  have  there  presumably <comma> they  mean  something  supernatural <period> anyway <comma> there  is  n't <period> you  do  n't  need  something  more  to  explain  something  more <period> thank  you  very  much <period> i  write  about  food <period> i  write  about  cooking <period> i  take  it  quite  seriously <comma> but  i  'm  here  to  talk  about  something  that  's  become  very  important  to  me  in  the  last  year  or  two <period> it  is  about  food <comma> but  it  's  not  about  cooking <comma> per  se <period> i  'm  going  to  start  with  this  picture  of  a  beautiful  cow <period> i  'm  not  a  vegetarian <comma> this  is  the  old  nixon  line <comma> right <questionmark> but  i  still  think  that  this <comma> may  be  this  year  's  version  of  this <period> now <comma> that  is  only  a  little  bit  hyperbolic <period> and  why  do  i  say  it <questionmark> because  only  once  before  has  the  fate  of  individual  people  and  the  fate  of  all  of  humanity  been  so  intertwined <period> there  was  the  bomb <comma> and  there  's  now <period> and  where  we  go  from  here  is  going  to  determine  not  only  the  quality  and  the  length  of  our  individual  lives <comma> but  whether <comma> if  we  could  see  the  earth  a  century  from  now <comma> we'd  recognize  it <period> it  's  a  holocaust  of  a  different  kind <comma> and  hiding  under  our  desks  is  n't  going  to  help <period> start  with  the  notion  that  global  warming  is  not  only  real <comma> but  dangerous <period> since  every  scientist  in  the  world  now  believes  this <comma> and  even  president  bush  has  seen  the  light <comma> or  pretends  to <comma> we  can  take  this  is  a  given <period> then  hear  this <comma> please <period> after  energy  production <comma> livestock  is  the  second-highest  contributor  to  atmosphere-altering  gases <period> nearly  one-fifth  of  all  greenhouse  gas  is  generated  by  livestock  production <comma> more  than  transportation <period> now <comma> you  can  make  all  the  jokes  you  want  about  cow  farts <comma> but  methane  is  20  times  more  poisonous  than  co2 <comma> and  it  's  not  just  methane <period> livestock  is  also  one  of  the  biggest  culprits  in  land  degradation <comma> air  and  water  pollution <comma> water  shortages  and  loss  of  biodiversity <period> there  's  more <period> like  half  the  antibiotics  in  this  country  are  not  administered  to  people <comma> but  to  animals <period> but  lists  like  this  become  kind  of  numbing <comma> so  let  me  just  say  this <comma> if  you  're  a  progressive <comma> if  you  're  driving  a  prius <comma> or  you  're  shopping  green <comma> or  you  're  looking  for  organic <comma> you  should  probably  be  a  semi-vegetarian <period> now <comma> i  'm  no  more  anti-cattle  than  i  am  anti-atom <comma> but  it  's  all  in  the  way  we  use  these  things <period> there  's  another  piece  of  the  puzzle <comma> which  ann  cooper  talked  about  beautifully  yesterday <comma> and  one  you  already  know <period> there  's  no  question <comma> none <comma> that  so-called  lifestyle  diseases <comma> diabetes <comma> heart  disease <comma> stroke <comma> some  cancers <comma> are  diseases  that  are  far  more  prevalent  here  than  anywhere  in  the  rest  of  the  world <period> and  that  's  the  direct  result  of  eating  a  western  diet <period> our  demand  for  meat <comma> dairy  and  refined  carbohydrates <comma> the  world  consumes  one  billion  cans  or  bottles  of  coke  a  day <comma> our  demand  for  these  things <comma> not  our  need <comma> our  want <comma> drives  us  to  consume  way  more  calories  than  are  good  for  us <period> and  those  calories  are  in  foods  that  cause <comma> not  prevent <comma> disease <period> now  global  warming  was  unforeseen <period> we  did  n't  know  that  pollution  did  more  than  cause  bad  visibility <period> maybe  a  few  lung  diseases  here  and  there <comma> but <comma> you  know <comma> that  's  not  such  a  big  deal <period> the  current  health  crisis <comma> however <comma> is  a  little  more  the  work  of  the  evil  empire <period> we  were  told <comma> we  were  assured <comma> that  the  more  meat  and  dairy  and  poultry  we  ate <comma> the  healthier  we'd  be <period> no <period> overconsumption  of  animals <comma> and  of  course <comma> junk  food <comma> is  the  problem <comma> along  with  our  paltry  consumption  of  plants <period> now <comma> there  's  no  time  to  get  into  the  benefits  of  eating  plants  here <comma> but  the  evidence  is  that  plants <comma> and  i  want  to  make  this  clear <comma> it  's  not  the  ingredients  in  plants <comma> it  's  the  plants <period> it  's  not  the  beta-carotene <comma> it  's  the  carrot <period> the  evidence  is  very  clear  that  plants  promote  health <period> this  evidence  is  overwhelming  at  this  point <period> you  eat  more  plants <comma> you  eat  less  other  stuff <comma> you  live  longer <period> not  bad <period> but  back  to  animals  and  junk  food <period> what  do  they  have  in  common <questionmark> one <comma> we  do  n't  need  either  of  them  for  health <period> we  do  n't  need  animal  products <comma> and  we  certainly  do  n't  need  white  bread  or  coke <period> two <comma> both  have  been  marketed  heavily <comma> creating  unnatural  demand <period> we  're  not  born  craving  whoppers  or  skittles <period> three <comma> their  production  has  been  supported  by  government  agencies  at  the  expense  of  a  more  health-  and  earth-friendly  diet <period> now <comma> let  's  imagine  a  parallel <period> let  's  pretend  that  our  government  supported  an  oil-based  economy <comma> while  discouraging  more  sustainable  forms  of  energy <comma> knowing  all  the  while  that  the  result  would  be  pollution <comma> war  and  rising  costs <period> incredible <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> yet  they  do  that <period> and  they  do  this  here <period> it  's  the  same  deal <period> the  sad  thing  is <comma> when  it  comes  to  diet <comma> is  that  even  when  well-intentioned  feds  try  to  do  right  by  us <comma> they  fail <period> either  they  're  outvoted  by  puppets  of  agribusiness <comma> or  they  are  puppets  of  agribusiness <period> so <comma> when  the  usda  finally  acknowledged  that  it  was  plants <comma> rather  than  animals <comma> that  made  people  healthy <comma> they  encouraged  us <comma> via  their  overly  simplistic  food  pyramid <comma> to  eat  five  servings  of  fruits  and  vegetables  a  day <comma> along  with  more  carbs <period> what  they  did  n't  tell  us  is  that  some  carbs  are  better  than  others <comma> and  that  plants  and  whole  grains  should  be  supplanting  eating  junk  food <period> but  industry  lobbyists  would  never  let  that  happen <period> and  guess  what <questionmark> half  the  people  who  developed  the  food  pyramid  have  ties  to  agribusiness <period> so <comma> instead  of  substituting  plants  for  animals <comma> our  swollen  appetites  simply  became  larger <comma> and  the  most  dangerous  aspects  of  them  remained  unchanged <period> so-called  low-fat  diets <comma> so-called  low-carb  diets <comma> these  are  not  solutions <period> but  with  lots  of  intelligent  people  focusing  on  whether  food  is  organic  or  local <comma> or  whether  we  're  being  nice  to  animals <comma> the  most  important  issues  just  are  n't  being  addressed <period> now <comma> do  n't  get  me  wrong <period> i  like  animals <comma> and  i  do  n't  think  it  's  just  fine  to  industrialize  their  production  and  to  churn  them  out  like  they  were  wrenches <period> but  there  's  no  way  to  treat  animals  well <comma> when  you  're  killing  10  billion  of  them  a  year <period> that  's  our  number <period> 10  billion <period> if  you  strung  all  of  them <comma> chickens <comma> cows <comma> pigs  and  lambs <comma> to  the  moon <comma> they'd  go  there  and  back  five  times <comma> there  and  back <period> now <comma> my  math  's  a  little  shaky <comma> but  this  is  pretty  good <comma> and  it  depends  whether  a  pig  is  four  feet  long  or  five  feet  long <comma> but  you  get  the  idea <period> that  's  just  the  united  states <period> and  with  our  hyper-consumption  of  those  animals  producing  greenhouse  gases  and  heart  disease <comma> kindness  might  just  be  a  bit  of  a  red  herring <period> let  's  get  the  numbers  of  the  animals  we  're  killing  for  eating  down <comma> and  then  we  'll  worry  about  being  nice  to  the  ones  that  are  left <period> another  red  herring  might  be  exemplified  by  the  word  locavore <comma> which  was  just  named  word  of  the  year  by  the  new  oxford  american  dictionary <period> seriously <period> and  locavore <comma> for  those  of  you  who  do  n't  know <comma> is  someone  who  eats  only  locally  grown  food  -- <period> which  is  fine  if  you  live  in  california <comma> but  for  the  rest  of  us  it  's  a  bit  of  a  sad  joke <period> between  the  official  story <comma> the  food  pyramid <comma> and  the  hip  locavore  vision <comma> you  have  two  versions  of  how  to  improve  our  eating <period> they  both  get  it  wrong <comma> though <period> the  first  at  least  is  populist <comma> and  the  second  is  elitist <period> how  we  got  to  this  place  is  the  history  of  food  in  the  united  states <period> and  i  'm  going  to  go  through  that <comma> at  least  the  last  hundred  years  or  so <comma> very  quickly  right  now <period> a  hundred  years  ago <comma> guess  what <questionmark> everyone  was  a  locavore <comma> even  new  york  had  pig  farms  nearby <comma> and  shipping  food  all  over  the  place  was  a  ridiculous  notion <period> every  family  had  a  cook <comma> usually  a  mom <period> and  those  moms  bought  and  prepared  food <period> it  was  like  your  romantic  vision  of  europe <period> margarine  did  n't  exist <period> in  fact <comma> when  margarine  was  invented <comma> several  states  passed  laws  declaring  that  it  had  to  be  dyed  pink <comma> so  we'd  all  know  that  it  was  a  fake <period> there  was  no  snack  food <comma> and  until  the  20s <comma> until  clarence  birdseye  came  along <comma> there  was  no  frozen  food <period> there  were  no  restaurant  chains <period> there  were  neighborhood  restaurants  run  by  local  people <period> but  none  of  them  would  think  to  open  another  one <period> eating  ethnic  was  unheard  of  unless  you  were  ethnic <period> and  fancy  food  was  entirely  french <period> as  an  aside <comma> those  of  you  who  remember  dan  aykroyd  in  the  1970s  doing  julia  child  imitations  can  see  where  he  got  the  idea  of  stabbing  himself  from  this  fabulous  slide <period> back  in  those  days <comma> before  even  julia <comma> back  in  those  days <comma> there  was  no  philosophy  of  food <period> you  just  ate <period> you  did  n't  claim  to  be  anything <period> there  was  no  marketing <period> there  were  no  national  brands <period> vitamins  had  not  been  invented <period> there  were  no  health  claims <comma> at  least  not  federally  sanctioned  ones <period> fats <comma> carbs <comma> proteins <comma> they  were  n't  bad  or  good <comma> they  were  food <period> you  ate  food <period> hardly  anything  contained  more  than  one  ingredient <comma> because  it  was  an  ingredient <period> the  cornflake  had  n't  been  invented <period> the  pop-tart <comma> the  pringle <comma> cheez  whiz <comma> none  of  that  stuff <period> goldfish  swam <period> it  's  hard  to  imagine <period> people  grew  food <comma> and  they  ate  food <period> and  again <comma> everyone  ate  local <period> in  new  york <comma> an  orange  was  a  common  christmas  present <comma> because  it  came  all  the  way  from  florida <period> from  the  30s  on <comma> road  systems  expanded <comma> trucks  took  the  place  of  railroads <comma> fresh  food  began  to  travel  more <period> oranges  became  common  in  new  york <period> the  south  and  west  became  agricultural  hubs <comma> and  in  other  parts  of  the  country <comma> suburbs  took  over  farmland <period> the  effects  of  this  are  well  known <period> they  are  everywhere <period> and  the  death  of  family  farms  is  part  of  this  puzzle <comma> as  is  almost  everything  from  the  demise  of  the  real  community  to  the  challenge  of  finding  a  good  tomato <comma> even  in  summer <period> eventually <comma> california  produced  too  much  food  to  ship  fresh <comma> so  it  became  critical  to  market  canned  and  frozen  foods <period> thus  arrived  convenience <period> it  was  sold  to  proto-feminist  housewives  as  a  way  to  cut  down  on  housework <period> now <comma> i  know  everybody  over  the  age  of <comma> like  45 <comma> their  mouths  are  watering  at  this  point <period> if  we  had  a  slide  of  salisbury  steak <comma> even  more  so <comma> right <questionmark> but  this  may  have  cut  down  on  housework <comma> but  it  cut  down  on  the  variety  of  food  we  ate  as  well <period> many  of  us  grew  up  never  eating  a  fresh  vegetable  except  the  occasional  raw  carrot  or  maybe  an  odd  lettuce  salad <period> i <comma> for  one <comma> and  i  'm  not  kidding <comma> did  n't  eat  real  spinach  or  broccoli  till  i  was  19 <period> who  needed  it  though <questionmark> meat  was  everywhere <period> what  could  be  easier <comma> more  filling  or  healthier  for  your  family  than  broiling  a  steak <questionmark> but  by  then  cattle  were  already  raised  unnaturally <period> rather  than  spending  their  lives  eating  grass <comma> for  which  their  stomachs  were  designed <comma> they  were  forced  to  eat  soy  and  corn <period> they  have  trouble  digesting  those  grains <comma> of  course <comma> but  that  was  n't  a  problem  for  producers <period> new  drugs  kept  them  healthy <period> well <comma> they  kept  them  alive <period> healthy  was  another  story <period> thanks  to  farm  subsidies <comma> the  fine  collaboration  between  agribusiness  and  congress <comma> soy <comma> corn  and  cattle  became  king <period> and  chicken  soon  joined  them  on  the  throne <period> it  was  during  this  period  that  the  cycle  of  dietary  and  planetary  destruction  began <comma> the  thing  we  're  only  realizing  just  now <period> listen  to  this <comma> between  1950  and  2000 <comma> the  world  's  population  doubled <period> meat  consumption  increased  five-fold <period> now <comma> someone  had  to  eat  all  that  stuff <comma> so  we  got  fast  food <period> and  this  took  care  of  the  situation  resoundingly <period> home  cooking  remained  the  norm <comma> but  its  quality  was  down  the  tubes <period> there  were  fewer  meals  with  home-cooked  breads <comma> desserts  and  soups <comma> because  all  of  them  could  be  bought  at  any  store <period> not  that  they  were  any  good <comma> but  they  were  there <period> most  moms  cooked  like  mine <comma> a  piece  of  broiled  meat <comma> a  quickly  made  salad  with  bottled  dressing <comma> canned  soup <comma> canned  fruit  salad <period> maybe  baked  or  mashed  potatoes <comma> or  perhaps  the  stupidest  food  ever <comma> minute  rice <period> for  dessert <comma> store-bought  ice  cream  or  cookies <period> my  mom  is  not  here <comma> so  i  can  say  this  now <period> this  kind  of  cooking  drove  me  to  learn  how  to  cook  for  myself <period> it  was  n't  all  bad <period> by  the  70s <comma> forward-thinking  people  began  to  recognize  the  value  of  local  ingredients <period> we  tended  gardens <comma> we  became  interested  in  organic  food <comma> we  knew  or  we  were  vegetarians <period> we  were  n't  all  hippies <comma> either <period> some  of  us  were  eating  in  good  restaurants  and  learning  how  to  cook  well <period> meanwhile <comma> food  production  had  become  industrial <period> industrial <period> perhaps  because  it  was  being  produced  rationally <comma> as  if  it  were  plastic <comma> food  gained  magical  or  poisonous  powers <comma> or  both <period> many  people  became  fat-phobic <period> others  worshiped  broccoli <comma> as  if  it  were  god-like <period> but  mostly  they  did  n't  eat  broccoli <period> instead  they  were  sold  on  yogurt <comma> yogurt  being  almost  as  good  as  broccoli <period> except <comma> in  reality <comma> the  way  the  industry  sold  yogurt  was  to  convert  it  to  something  much  more  akin  to  ice  cream <period> similarly <comma> let  's  look  at  a  granola  bar <period> you  think  that  that  might  be  healthy  food <comma> but  in  fact <comma> if  you  look  at  the  ingredient  list <comma> it  's  closer  in  form  to  a  snickers  than  it  is  to  oatmeal <period> sadly <comma> it  was  at  this  time  that  the  family  dinner  was  put  in  a  coma <comma> if  not  actually  killed  -- <period> the  beginning  of  the  heyday  of  value-added  food <comma> which  contained  as  many  soy  and  corn  products  as  could  be  crammed  into  it <period> think  of  the  frozen  chicken  nugget <period> the  chicken  is  fed  corn <comma> and  then  its  meat  is  ground  up <comma> and  mixed  with  more  corn  products  to  add  bulk  and  binder <comma> and  then  it  's  fried  in  corn  oil <period> all  you  do  is  nuke  it <period> what  could  be  better <questionmark> and  zapped  horribly <comma> pathetically <period> by  the  70s <comma> home  cooking  was  in  such  a  sad  state  that  the  high  fat  and  spice  contents  of  foods  like  mcnuggets  and  hot  pockets <comma> and  we  all  have  our  favorites <comma> actually <comma> made  this  stuff  more  appealing  than  the  bland  things  that  people  were  serving  at  home <period> at  the  same  time <comma> masses  of  women  were  entering  the  workforce <comma> and  cooking  simply  was  n't  important  enough  for  men  to  share  the  burden <period> so  now <comma> you've  got  your  pizza  nights <comma> you've  got  your  microwave  nights <comma> you've  got  your  grazing  nights <comma> you've  got  your  fend-for-yourself  nights  and  so  on <period> leading  the  way <comma> what  's  leading  the  way <questionmark> meat <comma> junk  food <comma> cheese: <period> the  very  stuff  that  will  kill  you <period> so <comma> now  we  clamor  for  organic  food <period> that  's  good <period> and  as  evidence  that  things  can  actually  change <comma> you  can  now  find  organic  food  in  supermarkets <comma> and  even  in  fast-food  outlets <period> but  organic  food  is  n't  the  answer  either <comma> at  least  not  the  way  it  's  currently  defined <period> let  me  pose  you  a  question <period> can  farm-raised  salmon  be  organic <comma> when  its  feed  has  nothing  to  do  with  its  natural  diet <comma> even  if  the  feed  itself  is  supposedly  organic <comma> and  the  fish  themselves  are  packed  tightly  in  pens <comma> swimming  in  their  own  filth <questionmark> and  if  that  salmon  's  from  chile <comma> and  it  's  killed  down  there  and  then  flown  5,000  miles <comma> whatever <comma> dumping  how  much  carbon  into  the  atmosphere <questionmark> i  do  n't  know <period> packed  in  styrofoam <comma> of  course <comma> before  landing  somewhere  in  the  united  states <comma> and  then  being  trucked  a  few  hundred  more  miles <period> this  may  be  organic  in  letter <comma> but  it  's  surely  not  organic  in  spirit <period> now  here  is  where  we  all  meet <period> the  locavores <comma> the  organivores <comma> the  vegetarians <comma> the  vegans <comma> the  gourmets  and  those  of  us  who  are  just  plain  interested  in  good  food <period> even  though  we've  come  to  this  from  different  points <comma> we  all  have  to  act  on  our  knowledge  to  change  the  way  that  everyone  thinks  about  food <period> we  need  to  start  acting <period> and  this  is  not  only  an  issue  of  social  justice <comma> as  ann  cooper  said <comma> and <comma> of  course <comma> she  's  completely  right <comma> but  it  's  also  one  of  global  survival <period> which  bring  me  full  circle  and  points  directly  to  the  core  issue <comma> the  overproduction  and  overconsumption  of  meat  and  junk  food <period> as  i  said <comma> 18  percent  of  greenhouse  gases  are  attributed  to  livestock  production <period> how  much  livestock  do  you  need  to  produce  this <questionmark> 70  percent  of  the  agricultural  land  on  earth <period> 30  percent  of  the  earth  's  land  surface  is  directly  or  indirectly  devoted  to  raising  the  animals  we  'll  eat <period> and  this  amount  is  predicted  to  double  in  the  next  40  years  or  so <period> and  if  the  numbers  coming  in  from  china  are  anything  like  what  they  look  like  now <comma> it  's  not  going  to  be  40  years <period> there  is  no  good  reason  for  eating  as  much  meat  as  we  do <period> and  i  say  this  as  a  man  who  has  eaten  a  fair  share  of  corned  beef  in  his  life <period> the  most  common  argument  is  that  we  need  nutrients <comma> even  though  we  eat <comma> on  average <comma> twice  as  much  protein  as  even  the  industry-obsessed  usda  recommends <period> but  listen <comma> experts  who  are  serious  about  disease  reduction  recommend  that  adults  eat  just  over  half  a  pound  of  meat  per  week <period> what  do  you  think  we  eat  per  day <questionmark> half  a  pound <period> but  do  n't  we  need  meat  to  be  big  and  strong <questionmark> is  n't  meat  eating  essential  to  health <questionmark> wo  n't  a  diet  heavy  in  fruit  and  vegetables  turn  us  into  godless <comma> sissy <comma> liberals <questionmark> some  of  us  might  think  that  would  be  a  good  thing <period> but <comma> no <comma> even  if  we  were  all  steroid-filled  football  players <comma> the  answer  is  no <period> in  fact <comma> there  's  no  diet  on  earth  that  meets  basic  nutritional  needs  that  wo  n't  promote  growth <comma> and  many  will  make  you  much  healthier  than  ours  does <period> we  do  n't  eat  animal  products  for  sufficient  nutrition <comma> we  eat  them  to  have  an  odd  form  of  malnutrition <comma> and  it  's  killing  us <period> to  suggest  that  in  the  interests  of  personal  and  human  health  americans  eat  50  percent  less  meat <comma> it  's  not  enough  of  a  cut <comma> but  it  's  a  start <period> it  would  seem  absurd <comma> but  that  's  exactly  what  should  happen <comma> and  what  progressive  people <comma> forward-thinking  people  should  be  doing  and  advocating <comma> along  with  the  corresponding  increase  in  the  consumption  of  plants <period> i've  been  writing  about  food  more  or  less  omnivorously <comma> one  might  say  indiscriminately <comma> for  about  30  years <period> during  that  time <comma> i've  eaten  and  recommended  eating  just  about  everything <period> i  'll  never  stop  eating  animals <comma> i  'm  sure <comma> but  i  do  think  that  for  the  benefit  of  everyone <comma> the  time  has  come  to  stop  raising  them  industrially  and  stop  eating  them  thoughtlessly <period> ann  cooper  's  right <period> the  usda  is  not  our  ally  here <period> we  have  to  take  matters  into  our  own  hands <comma> not  only  by  advocating  for  a  better  diet  for  everyone <comma> and  that  's  the  hard  part <comma> but  by  improving  our  own <period> and  that  happens  to  be  quite  easy <period> less  meat <comma> less  junk <comma> more  plants <period> it  's  a  simple  formula <comma> eat  food <period> eat  real  food <period> we  can  continue  to  enjoy  our  food <comma> and  we  continue  to  eat  well <comma> and  we  can  eat  even  better <period> we  can  continue  the  search  for  the  ingredients  we  love <comma> and  we  can  continue  to  spin  yarns  about  our  favorite  meals <period> we  'll  reduce  not  only  calories <comma> but  our  carbon  footprint <period> we  can  make  food  more  important <comma> not  less <comma> and  save  ourselves  by  doing  so <period> we  have  to  choose  that  path <period> thank  you <period> i  still  remember  the  day  in  school  when  our  teacher  told  us  that  the  world  population  had  become  three  billion  people <period> and  that  was  in  1960 <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  now  about  how  world  population  has  changed  from  that  year  and  into  the  future <period> but  i  will  not  use  digital  technology <comma> as  i've  done  during  my  first  five  tedtalks <period> instead <comma> i  have  progressed <comma> and  i  am <comma> today <comma> launching  a  brand  new  analog  teaching  technology  that  i  picked  up  from  ikea <comma> this  box <period> this  box  contains  one  billion  people <period> and  our  teacher  told  us  that  the  industrialized  world <comma> 1960 <comma> had  one  billion  people <period> in  the  developing  world <comma> she  said <comma> they  had  two  billion  people <period> and  they  lived  away  then <period> there  was  a  big  gap  between  the  one  billion  in  the  industrialized  world  and  the  two  billion  in  the  developing  world <period> in  the  industrialized  world <comma> people  were  healthy <comma> educated <comma> rich <comma> and  they  had  small  families <period> and  their  aspiration  was  to  buy  a  car <period> and  in  1960 <comma> all  swedes  were  saving  to  try  to  buy  a  volvo  like  this <period> this  was  the  economic  level  at  which  sweden  was <period> but  in  contrast  to  this <comma> in  the  developing  world <comma> far  away <comma> the  aspiration  of  the  average  family  there  was  to  have  food  for  the  day <period> they  were  saving  to  be  able  to  buy  a  pair  of  shoes <period> there  was  an  enormous  gap  in  the  world  when  i  grew  up <period> and  this  gap  between  the  west  and  the  rest  has  created  a  mindset  of  the  world <comma> which  we  still  use  linguistically  when  we  talk  about  the  west  and  the  developing  world <period> but  the  world  has  changed <comma> and  it  's  overdue  to  upgrade  that  mindset  and  that  taxonomy  of  the  world <comma> and  to  understand  it <period> and  that  's  what  i  'm  going  to  show  you <period> because  since  1960  what  has  happened  in  the  world  up  to  2010  is  that  a  staggering  four  billion  people  have  been  added  to  the  world  population <period> just  look  how  many <period> the  world  population  has  doubled  since  i  went  to  school <period> and  of  course <comma> there  's  been  economic  growth  in  the  west <period> a  lot  of  companies  have  happened  to  grow  the  economy <comma> so  the  western  population  moved  over  to  here <period> and  now  their  aspiration  is  not  only  to  have  a  car <period> now  they  want  to  have  a  holiday  on  a  very  remote  destination  and  they  want  to  fly <period> so  this  is  where  they  are  today <period> and  the  most  successful  of  the  developing  countries <comma> they  have  moved  on <comma> you  know <period> and  they  have  become  emerging  economies <comma> we  call  them <period> they  are  now  buying  cars <period> and  what  happened  a  month  ago  was  that  the  chinese  company <comma> geely <comma> they  acquired  the  volvo  company <period> and  then  finally  the  swedes  understood  that  something  big  had  happened  in  the  world <period> so  there  they  are <period> and  the  tragedy  is  that  the  two  billion  over  here  that  is  struggling  for  food  and  shoes <comma> they  are  still  almost  as  poor  as  they  were  50  years  ago <period> the  new  thing  is  that  we  have  the  biggest  pile  of  billions <comma> the  three  billions  here <comma> which  are  also  becoming  emerging  economies <comma> because  they  are  quite  healthy <comma> relatively  well-educated <comma> and  they  already  also  have  two  to  three  children  per  woman <comma> as  those  richer  also  have <period> and  their  aspiration  now  is <comma> of  course <comma> to  buy  a  bicycle <comma> and  then  later  on  they  would  like  to  have  a  motorbike  also <period> but  this  is  the  world  we  have  today <period> no  longer  any  gap <period> but  the  distance  from  the  poorest  here <comma> the  very  poorest <comma> to  the  very  richest  over  here  is  wider  than  ever <period> but  there  is  a  continuous  world  from  walking <comma> biking <comma> driving <comma> flying <comma> there  are  people  on  all  levels <period> and  most  people  tend  to  be  somewhere  in  the  middle <period> this  is  the  new  world  we  have  today  in  2010 <period> and  what  will  happen  in  the  future <questionmark> well <comma> i  'm  going  to  project  into  2050 <period> i  was  in  shanghai  recently <period> and  i  listened  to  what  's  happening  in  china <period> and  it  's  pretty  sure  that  they  will  catch  up <comma> just  as  japan  did <period> all  the  projections  say  that  this  one  billion  will  only  grow  with  one  to  two  or  three  percent <period> but  this  second  grows  with  seven <comma> eight  percent <comma> and  then  they  will  end  up  here <period> they  will  start  flying <period> and  these  lower  or  middle  income  countries <comma> the  emerging  income  countries <comma> they  will  also  forge  forwards  economically <period> and  if <comma> but  only  if <comma> we  invest  in  the  right  green  technology <comma> so  that  we  can  avoid  severe  climate  change <comma> and  energy  can  still  be  relatively  cheap <comma> then  they  will  move  all  the  way  up  here <period> and  they  will  start  to  buy  electric  cars <period> this  is  what  we  will  find  there <period> so  what  about  the  poorest  two  billion <questionmark> what  about  the  poorest  two  billion  here <questionmark> will  they  move  on <questionmark> well <comma> here  population  growth  comes  in  because  there  among  emerging  economies  we  already  have  two  to  three  children  per  woman <comma> family  planning  is  widely  used <comma> and  population  growth  is  coming  to  an  end <period> here  among  the  poorest <comma> population  is  growing <period> so  these  poorest  two  billion  will <comma> in  the  next  decades <comma> increase  to  three  billion <period> and  they  will  thereafter  increase  to  four  billion <period> there  is  nothing <comma> but  a  nuclear  war  of  a  kind  we've  never  seen <comma> that  can  stop  this  growth  from  happening <period> because  we  already  have  this  growth  in  process <period> but  if <comma> and  only  if <comma> the  poorest  get  out  of  poverty <comma> they  get  education <comma> they  get  improved  child  survival <comma> they  can  buy  a  bicycle  and  a  cell  phone  and  come  to  live  here <comma> then  population  growth  will  stop  in  2050 <period> we  cannot  have  people  on  this  level  looking  for  food  and  shoes  because  then  we  get  continued  population  growth <period> and  let  me  show  you  why  by  converting  back  to  the  old-time  digital  technology <period> here  i  have  on  the  screen  my  country  bubbles <period> every  bubble  is  a  country <period> the  size  is  population <period> the  colors  show  the  continent <period> the  yellow  on  there  is  the  americas <period> dark  blue  is  africa <period> brown  is  europe <period> green  is  the  middle  east  and  this  light  blue  is  south  asia <period> that  's  india  and  this  is  china <period> size  is  population <period> here  i  have  children  per  woman <comma> two  children <comma> four  children <comma> six  children <comma> eight  children <comma> big  families <comma> small  families <period> the  year  is  1960 <period> and  down  here <comma> child  survival <comma> the  percentage  of  children  surviving  childhood  up  to  starting  school: <period> 60  percent <comma> 70  percent <comma> 80  percent <comma> 90 <comma> and  almost  100  percent <comma> as  we  have  today  in  the  wealthiest  and  healthiest  countries <period> but  look <comma> this  is  the  world  my  teacher  talked  about  in  1960: <period> one  billion  western  world  here <comma> high  child-survival <comma> small  families  -- <period> and  all  the  rest <comma> the  rainbow  of  developing  countries <comma> with  very  large  families  and  poor  child  survival <period> what  has  happened <questionmark> i  start  the  world <period> here  we  go <period> can  you  see <comma> as  the  years  pass  by <comma> child  survival  is  increasing <questionmark> they  get  soap <comma> hygiene <comma> education <comma> vaccination <comma> penicillin <period> and  then  family  planning <period> family  size  is  decreasing <period> when  they  get  up  to  90-percent  child  survival <comma> then  families  decrease <period> and  most  of  the  arab  countries  in  the  middle  east  is  falling  down  there  to  small  families <period> look <comma> bangladesh  catching  up  with  india <period> the  whole  emerging  world  joins  the  western  world  with  good  child  survival  and  small  family  size <period> but  we  still  have  the  poorest  billion <period> can  you  see  the  poorest  billion <comma> those  two  boxes  i  had  over  here <questionmark> they  are  still  up  here <period> and  they  still  have  a  child  survival  of  only  70  to  80  percent <comma> meaning  that  if  you  have  six  children  born <comma> there  will  be  at  least  four  who  survive  to  the  next  generation <period> and  the  population  will  double  in  one  generation <period> so  the  only  way  of  really  getting  world  population  growth  to  stop  is  to  continue  to  improve  child  survival  to  90  percent <period> that  's  why  investments  by  gates  foundation <comma> unicef  and  aid  organizations <comma> together  with  national  government  in  the  poorest  countries <comma> are  so  good <period> because  they  are  actually  helping  us  to  reach  a  sustainable  population  size  of  the  world <period> we  can  stop  at  nine  billion  if  we  do  the  right  things <period> child  survival  is  the  new  green <period> it  's  only  by  child  survival  that  we  will  stop  population  growth <period> and  will  it  happen <questionmark> well <comma> i  'm  not  an  optimist <comma> neither  am  i  a  pessimist <period> i  'm  a  very  serious  possibilist <period> it  's  a  new  category  where  we  take  emotion  apart <comma> and  we  just  work  analytically  with  the  world <period> it  can  be  done <period> we  can  have  a  much  more  just  world <period> with  green  technology  and  with  investments  to  alleviate  poverty <comma> and  global  governance <comma> the  world  can  become  like  this <period> and  look  at  the  position  of  the  old  west <period> remember  when  this  blue  box  was  all  alone <comma> leading  the  world <comma> living  its  own  life <period> this  will  not  happen  again <period> the  role  of  the  old  west  in  the  new  world  is  to  become  the  foundation  of  the  modern  world <comma> nothing  more <comma> nothing  less <period> but  it  's  a  very  important  role <period> do  it  well  and  get  used  to  it <period> thank  you  very  much <period> text <comma> beatjazz <period> beatjazz  is <comma> 1 <period> live  looping <comma> 2 <period>

it  should  stop  being  safe <period> but  if  you  know  anything  about  the  history  of  britannica  since  1962 <comma> it  was  anything  but  radical <comma> still  a  very  completely  safe <comma> stodgy  type  of  encyclopedia <period> wikipedia <comma> on  the  other  hand <comma> begins  with  a  very  radical  idea <comma> and  that  's  for  all  of  us  to  imagine  a  world  in  which  every  single  person  on  the  planet  is  given  free  access  to  the  sum  of  all  human  knowledge <period> and  that  's  what  we  're  doing <period> so  wikipedia <comma> you  just  saw  the  little  demonstration  of  it <comma> it  's  a  freely  licensed  encyclopedia <period> it  's  written  by  thousands  of  volunteers  all  over  the  world  in  many <comma> many

organization <comma> he  's  exactly  describing  wikipedia <period> and  what  i  'm  going  to  do  today  is  tell  you  a  little  bit  more  about  how  it  really  works  on  the  inside <period> so  wikipedia  's  owned  by  the  wikimedia  foundation <comma> which  i  founded <comma> a  nonprofit  organization <period> and  our  goal <comma> the  core  aim  of  the  wikimedia  foundation <comma> is  to  get  a  free  encyclopedia  to  every  single  person  on  the  planet <period> and  so  if  you  think  about  what  that  means <comma> it  means  a  lot  more  than  just  building  a  cool  website <period> we  're  really  interested  in  all  the  issues  of  the  digital  divide <comma> poverty  worldwide <comma> empowering  people  everywhere  to  have  the  information  that  they  need  to  make  good  decisions <period> and  so  we  're  going  to  have  to  do  a  lot  of  work  that  goes  beyond  just  the  internet <period> and  so  that  's  a  big  part  of  why  we've  chosen  the  free  licensing  model <comma> because  that  empowers  local  entrepreneurs <comma> or  anyone  who  wants  to <comma> can  take  our  content  and  do  anything  they  like  with  it <comma> you  can  copy  it <comma> redistribute  it  and  you  can  do  it  commercially  or  non-commercially <period> so  there  's  a  lot  of  opportunities  that  are  going  to  arise  around  wikipedia  all  over  the  world <period> we  're  funded  by  donations  from  the  public <comma> and  one  of  the  more  interesting  things  about  that  is  how  little  money  it  actually  takes  to  run  wikipedia <period> so  yochai  showed  you  the  graph  of  what  the  cost  of  a  printing  press  was <period> and  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  what  the  cost  of  wikipedia  is <comma> but  first  i  'll  show  you  how  big  it  is <period> so  we've  got  over  600,000  articles  in  english <period> we've  got  two  million  total  articles  across  many <comma> many  different  languages <period> the  biggest  languages  are  german <comma> japanese <comma> french  -- <period> all  the  western  european  languages  are  quite  big <period> but  only  around  one-third  of  all  of  our  traffic  to  our  web  clusters  to  the  english  wikipedia <comma> which  is  surprising  to  a  lot  of  people <period> a  lot  of  people  think  in  a  very  english-centric  way  on  the  internet <comma> but  for  us <comma> we  're  truly  global <period> we  're  in  many <comma> many  languages <period> how  popular  we've  gotten  to  be <comma> we  're  a  top  50  website  and  we  're  more  popular  than  the  new  york  times <period> so  this  is  where  we  get  to  yochai  's  discussion <period> this  shows  the  growth  of  wikipedia <comma> we  're  the  blue  line  there <comma> and  then  this  is  the  new  york  times  over  there <period> and  what  's  interesting  about  this  is  the  new  york  times  website  is  a  huge <comma> enormous  corporate  operation  with <comma> i  have  no  idea  how  many  hundreds  of  employees <period> we  have  exactly  one  employee <comma> and  that  employee  is  our  lead  software  developer <period> and  he  's  only  been  our  employee  since  january  2005 <comma> all  the  other  growth  before  that <period> so  the  servers  are  managed  by  a  rag-tag  band  of  volunteers <period> all  the  editing  is  done  by  volunteers <period> and  the  way  that  we  're  organized  is  not  like  any  traditional  organization  you  can  imagine <period> people  are  always  asking <comma> well <comma> who  's  in  charge  of  this <questionmark> or  who  does  that  and  the  answer  is <comma> anybody  who  wants  to  pitch  in <period> it  's  a  very  unusual  and  chaotic  thing <period> we've  got  over  90  servers  now  in  three  locations <period> these  are  managed  by  volunteer  system  administrators  who  are  online <period> i  can  go  online  any  time  of  the  day  or  night  and  see  eight  to  10  people  waiting  for  me  to  ask  a  question  or  something <comma> anything  about  the  servers <period> you  could  never  afford  to  do  this  in  a  company <period> you  could  never  afford  to  have  a  standby  crew  of  people  24  hours  a  day  and  do  what  we  're  doing  at  wikipedia <period> so  we  're  doing  around  14  billion  page  views  monthly <comma> so  it  's  really  gotten  to  be  a  huge  thing <period> and  everything  is  managed  by  the  volunteers <period> and  the  total  monthly  cost  for  our  bandwidth  is  about  5,000  dollars <period> and  that  's  essentially  our  main  cost <period> we  could  actually  do  without  the  employee <period> we  actually <comma> we  hired  brian  because  he  was  working  part-time  for  two  years  and  full-time  at  wikipedia <comma> so  we  actually  hired  him  so  he  could  get  a  life  and  go  to  the  movies  sometimes <period> so  the  big  question  when  you've  got  this  really  chaotic  organization  is <comma> why  is  n't  it  all  rubbish <questionmark> why  is  the  website  as  good  as  it  is <questionmark> first  of  all <comma> how  good  is  it <questionmark> well <comma> it  's  pretty  good <period> it  is  n't  perfect <comma> but  it  's  much <comma> much  better  than  you  would  expect <comma> given  our  completely  chaotic  model <period> so  when  you  saw  him  make  a  ridiculous  edit  to  the  page  about  me <comma> you  think <comma> oh <comma> this  is  obviously  just  going  to  degenerate  into  rubbish <period> but  when  we've  seen  quality  tests <comma> and  there  have  n't  been  enough  of  these  yet  and  i  'm  really  encouraging  people  to  do  more <comma> comparing  wikipedia  to  traditional  things <comma> we  win  hands  down <period> so  a  german  magazine  compared  german  wikipedia <comma> which  is  really  much <comma> much  smaller  than  english <comma> to  microsoft  encarta  and  to  brockhaus  multimedia <comma> and  we  won  across  the  board <period> they  hired  experts  to  come  and  look  at  articles  and  compare  the  quality <comma> and  we  were  very  pleased  with  that  result <period> so  a  lot  of  people  have  heard  about  the  wikipedia  bush-kerry  controversy <period> the  media  has  covered  this  somewhat  extensively <period> it  started  out  with  an  article  in  red  herring <period> the  reporters  called  me  up  and  they <comma> i  mean <comma> i  have  to  say  they  spelled  my  name  right <comma> but  they  really  wanted  to  say <comma> the  bush-kerry  election  is  so  contentious <comma> it  's  tearing  apart  the  wikipedia  community <period> and  so  they  quote  me  as  saying <comma> they  're  the  most  contentious  in  the  history  of  wikipedia <period> what  i  actually  said  is <comma> they  're  not  contentious  at  all <period> so  it  's  a  slight  misquote <period> the  articles  were  edited  quite  heavily <period> and  it  is  true  that  we  did  have  to  lock  the  articles  on  a  couple  of  occasions <period> time  magazine  recently  reported  that  extreme  action  sometimes  has  to  be  taken <comma> and  wales  locked  the  entries  on  kerry  and  bush  for  most  of  2004 <period> this  came  after  i  told  the  reporter  that  we  had  to  lock  it  for <comma> occasionally  a  little  bit  here  and  there <period> so  the  truth  in  general  is  that  the  kinds  of  controversies  that  you  would  probably  think  we  have  within  the  wikipedia  community  are  not  really  controversies  at  all <period> articles  on  controversial  topics  are  edited  a  lot <comma> but  they  do  n't  cause  much  controversy  within  the  community <period> and  the  reason  for  this  is  that  most  people  understand  the  need  for  neutrality <period> the  real  struggle  is  not  between  the  right  and  the  left <comma> that  's  where  most  people  assume <comma> but  it  's  between  the  party  of  the  thoughtful  and  the  party  of  the  jerks <period> and  no  side  of  the  political  spectrum  has  a  monopoly  on  either  of  those  qualities <period> the  actual  truth  about  the  specific  bush-kerry  incident  is  that  the  bush-kerry  articles  were  locked  less  than  one  percent  of  the  time  in  2004 <comma> and  it  was  n't  because  they  were  contentious <period> it  was  just  because  there  was  routine  vandalism <comma> which  happens  sometimes  even  on  stage <comma> people <comma> sometimes  even  reporters  have  reported  to  me  that  they  vandalize  wikipedia  and  were  amazed  that  it  was  fixed  so  quickly <period> and  i  said <comma> you  know <comma> i  always  say <comma> please  do  n't  do  that <period> that  's  not  a  good  thing <period> so  how  do  we  do  this <questionmark> how  do  we  manage  the  quality  control <questionmark> how  does  it  work <questionmark> so  there  's  a  few  elements <comma> mostly  social  policies  and  some  elements  of  the  software <period> so  the  biggest  and  the  most  important  thing  is  our  neutral  point-of-view  policy <period> this  is  something  that  i  set  down  from  the  very  beginning <comma> as  a  core  principle  of  the  community  that  's  completely  not  debatable <period> it  's  a  social  concept  of  cooperation <comma> so  we  do  n't  talk  a  lot  about  truth  and  objectivity <period> the  reason  for  this  is  if  we  say  we  're  only  going  to  write  the  truth  about  some  topic <comma> that  does  n't  do  us  a  damn  bit  of  good  of  figuring  out  what  to  write <comma> because  i  do  n't  agree  with  you  about  what  's  the  truth <period> but  we  have  this  jargon  term  of  neutrality <comma> which  has  its  own  long  history  within  the  community <comma> which  basically  says <comma> any  time  there  's  a  controversial  issue <comma> wikipedia  itself  should  not  take  a  stand  on  the  issue <period> we  should  merely  report  on  what  reputable  parties  have  said  about  it <period> so  this  neutrality  policy  is  really  important  for  us <comma> because  it  empowers  a  community  that  is  very  diverse  to  come  together  and  actually  get  some  work  done <period> so  we  have  very  diverse  contributors  in  terms  of  political <comma> religious <comma> cultural  backgrounds <period> by  having  this  firm  neutrality  policy <comma> which  is  non-negotiable  from  the  beginning <comma> we  ensure  that  people  can  work  together  and  that  the  entries  do  n't  become  simply  a  war  back  and  forth  between  the  left  and  the  right <period> if  you  engage  in  that  type  of  behavior <comma> you  'll  be  asked  to  leave  the  community <period> so  real-time  peer  review <period> every  single  change  on  the  site  goes  to  the  recent  changes  page <period> so  as  soon  as  he  made  his  change <comma> it  went  to  the  recent  changes  page <period> that  recent  changes  page  was  also  fed  into  irc  channel <comma> which  is  an  internet  chat  channel  that  people  are  monitoring  with  various  software  tools <period> and  people  can  get  rss  feeds <comma> they  can  get  e-mail  notifications  of  changes <period> and  then  users  can  set  up  their  own  personal  watch  list <period> so  my  page  is  on  quite  a  few  volunteers  watch  lists <comma> because  it  is  sometimes  vandalized <period> and  therefore <comma> what  happens  is  someone  will  notice  the  change  very  quickly <comma> and  then  they  'll  just  simply  revert  the  change <period> there  's  a  new  pages  feed <comma> for  example <comma> so  you  can  go  to  a  certain  page  of  wikipedia  and  see  every  new  page  as  it  's  created <period> this  is  really  important <comma> because  a  lot  of  new  pages  that  get  created  are  just  garbage  that  have  to  be  deleted <comma> you  know <comma> asdfasdf <period> but  also  that  's  some  of  the  most  interesting  and  fun  things  at  wikipedia <comma> some  of  the  new  articles <period> people  will  start  an  article  on  some  interesting  topic <comma> other  people  will  find  that  intriguing  and  jump  in  and  help  and  make  it  much  better <period> so  we  do  have  edits  by  anonymous  users <comma> which  is  one  of  the  most  controversial  and  intriguing  things  about  wikipedia <period> so  chris  was  able  to  do  his  change <comma> he  did  n't  have  to  log  in  or  anything <period> he  just  went  on  the  website  and  made  a  change <period> but  it  turns  out  that  only  about  18  percent  of  all  the  edits  to  the  website  are  done  by  anonymous  users <period> and  that  's  a  really  important  thing  to  understand <comma> is  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  edits  that  go  on  on  the  website  are  from  a  very  close-knit  community  of  maybe  600  to  1,000  people  who  are  in  constant  communication <period> and  we  have  over  40  irc  channels <comma> 40  mailing  lists <period> all  these  people  know  each  other <period> they  communicate <period> we  have  offline  meetings <period> these  are  the  people  who  are  doing  the  bulk  of  the  site <comma> and  they  are <comma> in  a  sense <comma> semi-professionals  at  what  they  're  doing <comma> that  the  standards  we  set  for  ourselves  are  equal  to  or  higher  than  professional  standards  of  quality <period> we  do  n't  always  meet  those  standards <comma> but  that  's  what  we  're  striving  for <period> and  so  that  tight  community  is  who  really  cares  for  the  site <comma> and  these  are  some  of  the  smartest  people  i've  ever  met <period> of  course <comma> it  's  my  job  to  say  that <comma> but  it  's  actually  true <period> the  type  of  people  who  were  drawn  to  writing  an  encyclopedia  for  fun  tend  to  be  pretty  smart  people <period> the  tools  and  the  software <comma> there  's  lots  of  tools  that  allow  us <comma> allow  us <comma> meaning  the  community <comma> to  self-monitor  and  to  monitor  all  the  work <period> this  is  an  example  of  a  page  history  on  flat  earth <comma> and  you  can  see  some  changes  that  were  made <period> what  's  nice  about  this  page  is  you  can  immediately  take  a  look  at  this  and  see <comma> oh  ok <comma> i  understand  now <period> when  somebody  goes  and  looks  at <comma> they  see  that  someone <comma> an  anonymous  ip  number <comma> made  an  edit  to  my  page <comma> that  sounds  suspicious <comma> who  is  this  person <questionmark> somebody  looks  at  it <comma> they  can  immediately  see  highlighted  in  red  all  of  the  changes  that  took  place <comma> to  see <comma> ok <comma> well <comma> these  words  have  changed <comma> things  like  this <period> so  that  's  one  tool  that  we  can  use  to  very  quickly  monitor  the  history  of  a  page <period> another  thing  that  we  do  within  the  community  is  we  leave  everything  very  open-ended <period> most  of  the  social  rules  and  the  methods  of  work  are  left  completely  open-ended  in  the  software <period> all  of  that  stuff  is  just  on  wiki  pages <period> and  so  there  's  nothing  in  the  software  that  enforces  the  rules <period> the  example  i've  got  up  here  is  a  votes  for  deletion  page <period> so <comma> i  mentioned  earlier <comma> people  type  asdfasdf <comma> it  needs  to  be  deleted <period> cases  like  that <comma> the  administrators  just  delete  it <period> there  's  no  reason  to  have  a  big  argument  about  it <period> but  you  can  imagine  there  's  a  lot  of  other  areas  where  the  question  is <comma> is  this  notable  enough  to  go  in  an  encyclopedia <questionmark> is  the  information  verifiable <questionmark> is  it  a  hoax <questionmark> is  it  true <questionmark> is  it  what <questionmark> so  we  needed  a  social  method  for  figuring  out  the  answer  to  this <period> and  so  the  method  that  arose  organically  within  the  community  is  the  votes  for  deletion  page <period> and  in  the  particular  example  we  have  here <comma> it  's  a  film <comma> twisted  issues <comma> and  the  first  person  says <comma> now  this  is  supposedly  a  film <period> it  fails  the  google  test  miserably <period> the  google  test  is <comma> you  look  in  google  and  see  if  it  's  there <comma> because  if  something  's  not  even  in  google <comma> it  probably  does  n't  exist  at  all <period> it  's  not  a  perfect  rule <comma> but  it  's  a  nice  starting  point  for  quick  research <period> so  somebody  says <comma> delete  it <comma> please <period> delete  it <comma> it  's  not  notable <period> and  then  somebody  says <comma> wait <comma> wait <comma> wait <comma> wait <comma> i  found  it <period> i  found  it  in  a  book <comma> film  threat  video  guide <comma> the  20  underground  films  you  must  see' <period> oh <comma> ok <period> so  the  next  persons  says <comma> clean  it  up  somebody  says <comma> i've  found  it  on  imdb <period> keep <comma> keep <comma> keep <period> and  what  's  interesting  about  this  is  that  the  software  is <comma> these  votes  are  just <comma> they  're  just  text  typed  into  a  page <period> this  is  not  really  a  vote  so  much  as  it  is  a  dialogue <period> now  it  is  true  that  at  the  end  of  the  day  an  administrator  can  go  through  here  and  take  a  look  at  this  and  say <comma> ok <comma> 18  deletes <comma> two  keeps <comma> we  'll  delete  it <period> but  in  other  cases <comma> this  could  be  18  deletes  and  two  keeps <comma> and  we  would  keep  it <comma> because  if  those  last  two  keeps  say <comma> wait  a  minute <comma> wait  a  minute <period> nobody  else  saw  this  but  i  found  it  in  a  book <comma> and  i  found  a  link  to  a  page  that  describes  it <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  clean  it  up  tomorrow <comma> so  please  do  n't  delete  it <comma> then  it  would  survive <period> and  it  also  matters  who  the  people  are  who  are  voting <period> like  i  say <comma> it  's  a  tight  knit  community <period> down  here  at  the  bottom <comma> keep <comma> real  movie <comma> rick  kay <period> rick  kay  is  a  very  famous  wikipedian  who  does  an  enormous  amount  of  work  with  vandalism <comma> hoaxes  and  votes  for  deletion <period> his  voice  carries  a  lot  of  weight  within  the  community  because  he  knows  what  he  's  doing <period> so  how  's  all  this  governed <questionmark> people  really  want  to  know  about <comma> ok <comma> administrators <comma> things  like  that <period> so  the  wikipedia  governance  model <comma> the  governance  of  the  community <comma> is  a  very  confusing <comma> but  a  workable  mix  of  consensus  -- <period> meaning  we  try  not  to  vote  on  the  content  of  articles <comma> because  the  majority  view  is  not  necessarily  neutral <period> some  amount  of  democracy <comma> all  of  the  administrators <comma> these  are  the  people  who  have  the  ability  to  delete  pages <comma> that  does  n't  mean  that  they  have  the  right  to  delete  pages <period> they  still  have  to  follow  all  the  rules <comma> but  they  're  elected <period> they  're  elected  by  the  community <period> sometimes  people <comma> random  trolls  on  the  internet <comma> like  to  accuse  me  of  handpicking  the  administrators  to  bias  the  content  of  the  encyclopedia <period> i  always  laugh  at  this <comma> because  i  have  no  idea  how  they  're  elected <comma> actually <period> there  's  a  certain  amount  of  aristocracy <period> and  so  you've  got  a  hint  of  that  when  i  mentioned <comma> like <comma> rick  kay  's  voice  would  carry  a  lot  more  weight  than  someone  we  do  n't  know <period> i  give  this  talk  sometimes  with  angela <comma> who  was  just  re-elected  to  the  board  from  the  community <comma> to  the  board  of  the  foundation <comma> with  more  than  twice  the  votes  of  the  person  who  did  n't  make  it <period> and  i  always  embarrass  her  because  i  say <comma> well <comma> angela <comma> for  example <comma> could  get  away  with  doing  absolutely  anything  within  wikipedia <comma> because  she  's  so  admired  and  so  powerful <period> but  the  irony  is <comma> of  course <comma> that  angela  can  do  this  because  she  's  the  one  person  who  you  know  would  never <comma> ever <comma> ever  break  any  rules  of  wikipedia <period> and  i  also  like  to  say  she  's  the  only  person  who  actually  knows  all  the  rules  of  wikipedia <comma> so <period> and  then  there  's  monarchy  and  that  's  my  role  on  the  community <comma> so <period> i  was  describing  this  in  berlin  once  and  the  next  day  in  the  newspaper  the  headline  said <comma> i  am  the  queen  of  england <period> and  that  's  not  exactly  what  i  said   <comma> but <comma> the  point  is  my  role  in  the  community <comma> within  the  free  software  world  there  's  been  a  longstanding  tradition  of  the  benevolent  dictator  model <period> so  if  you  look  at  most  of  the  major  free  software  projects <comma> they  have  one  single  person  in  charge  who  everyone  agrees  is  the  benevolent  dictator <period> well <comma> i  do  n't  like  the  term  benevolent  dictator <comma> and  i  do  n't  think  that  it  's  my  job  or  my  role  in  the  world  of  ideas  to  be  the  dictator  of  the  future  of  all  human  knowledge  compiled  by  the  world <period> it  just  is  n't  appropriate <period> but  there  is  a  need  still  for  a  certain  amount  of  monarchy <comma> a  certain  amount  of <comma> sometimes  we  have  to  make  a  decision <comma> and  we  do  n't  want  to  get  bogged  down  too  heavily  in  formal  decision-making  processes <period> so  as  an  example  of  why  this  has  been <comma> or  how  this  can  be  important <comma> we  recently  had  a  situation  where  a  neo-nazi  website  discovered  wikipedia <comma> and  they  said <comma> oh <comma> well <comma> this  is  horrible <comma> this  jewish  conspiracy  of  a  website  and  we  're  going  to  get  certain  articles  deleted  that  we  do  n't  like <period> and  we  see  they  have  a  voting  process <comma> so  we  're  going  to  send <comma> we  have  40,000  members  and  we  're  going  to  send  them  over  and  they  're  all  going  to  vote  and  get  these  pages  deleted <period> well <comma> they  managed  to  get  18  people  to  show  up <period> that  's  neo-nazi  math  for  you <period> they  always  think  they've  got  40,000  members  when  they've  got  18 <period> but  they  managed  to  get  18  people  to  come  and  vote  in  a  fairly  absurd  way  to  delete  a  perfectly  valid  article <period> of  course <comma> the  vote  ended  up  being  about  85  to  18 <comma> so  there  was  no  real  danger  to  our  democratic  processes <period> on  the  other  hand <comma> people  said <comma> but  what  are  we  going  to  do <questionmark> i  mean <comma> this  could  happen  and  what  if  some  group  gets  really  seriously  organized  and  comes  in  and  wants  to  vote <questionmark> then  i  said <comma> well  fuck  it <comma> we  'll  just  change  the  rules <period> that  's  my  job  in  the  community <comma> to  say  we  wo  n't  allow  our  openness  and  freedom  to  undermine  the  quality  of  the  content <period> and  so  as  long  as  people  trust  me  in  my  role <comma> then  that  's  a  valid  place  for  me <period> of  course <comma> because  of  the  free  licensing <comma> if  i  do  a  bad  job <comma> the  volunteers  are  more  than  happy  to  take  and  leave  -- <period> i  cannot  tell  anyone  what  to  do <period> so  the  final  point  here  is  that  to  understand  how  wikipedia  works <comma> it  's  important  to  understand  that  our  wiki  model  is  the  way  we  work <comma> but  we  are  not  fanatical  web  anarchists <period> in  fact <comma> we  're  very  flexible  about  the  social  methodology <comma> because  it  's  ultimately  the  passion  of  the  community  is  for  the  quality  of  the  work <period> not  necessarily  for  the  process  that  we  use  to  generate  it <period> thank  you <period> ben  saunders <comma> yeah <comma> hi <comma> ben  saunders <period> jimmy <comma> you  mentioned  impartiality  being  a  key  to  wikipedia  's  success <period> it  strikes  me  that  much  of  the  textbooks  that  are  used  to  educate  our  children  are  inherently  biased <period> have  you  found  wikipedia  being  used  by  teachers <comma> and  how  do  you  see  wikipedia  changing  education <questionmark> jimmy  wales <comma> yeah <comma> so <comma> a  lot  of  teachers  are  beginning  to  use  wikipedia <period> there  's  a  media  storyline  about  wikipedia <comma> which  i  think  is  false <period> it  builds  on  the  storyline  of  bloggers  versus  newspapers <period> and  the  storyline  is <comma> there  's  this  crazy  thing <comma> wikipedia <comma> but  academics  hate  it  and  teachers  hate  it <period> and  that  turns  out  to  not  be  true <period> the  last  time  i  got  an  e-mail  from  a  journalist  saying <comma> why  do  academics  hate  wikipedia <questionmark> i  sent  it  from  my  harvard  email  address <comma> because  i  was  recently  appointed  a  fellow  there <period> and  i  said <comma> well <comma> they  do  n't  all  hate  it <period> but  i  think  there  's  going  to  be  huge  impacts <period> and  we  actually  have  a  project  that  i  'm  personally  really  excited  about <comma> which  is  the  wiki  books  project <comma> which  is  an  effort  to  create  textbooks  in  all  the  languages <period> and  that  's  a  much  bigger  project <period> it  's  going  to  take  20  years  or  so  to  come  to  fruition <period> but  part  of  that  is  to  fulfill  our  mission  of  giving  an  encyclopedia  to  every  single  person  on  the  planet <period> we  do  n't  mean  we  're  going  to  spam  them  with  aol-style  cds <period> we  mean  we  're  going  to  give  them  a  tool  that  they  can  use <period> and  for  a  lot  of  people  in  the  world <comma> if  i  give  you  an  encyclopedia  that  's  written  at  a  university  level <comma> it  does  n't  do  you  any  good  without  a  whole  host  of  literacy  materials  to  build  you  up  to  the  point  where  you  can  actually  use  it <period> and  so  the  wiki  books  project  is  an  effort  to  do  that <period> and  i  think  that  we  're  going  to  really  see  a  huge <comma> it  may  not  even  come  from  us <period> there  's  all  kinds  of  innovation  going  on <period> but  freely  licensed  textbooks  are  the  next  big  thing  in  education <period> what  i  want  to  talk  to  you  about  today  is  some  of  the  problems  that  the  military  of  the  western  world <comma> australia <comma> united  states <comma> uk <period> and  so  on <comma> face  in  some  of  the  deployments  that  they  're  dealing  with  in  the  modern  world  at  this  time <period> if  you  think  about  the  sorts  of  things  that  we've  sent  australian  military  personnel  to  in  recent  years <comma> we've  got  obvious  things  like  iraq  and  afghanistan <comma> but  you've  also  got  things  like  east  timor  and  the  solomon  islands  and  so  on <period> and  a  lot  of  these  deployments  that  we  're  actually  sending  military  personnel  to  these  days  are  n't  traditional  wars <period> in  fact <comma> a  lot  of  the  jobs  that  we  're  asking  the  military  personnel  to  do  in  these  situations  are  ones  that <comma> in  their  own  countries <comma> in  australia <comma> the  united  states  and  so  on <comma> would  actually  be  done  by  police  officers <period> and  so  there  's  a  bunch  of  problems  that  come  up  for  military  personnel  in  these  situations <comma> because  they  're  doing  things  that  they  have  n't  really  been  trained  for <comma> and  they  're  doing  things  that  those  who  do  them  in  their  own  countries  are  trained  very  differently  for  and  equipped  very  differently  for <period> now  there  's  a  bunch  of  reasons  why  we  actually  do  send  military  personnel  rather  than  police  to  do  these  jobs <period> if  australia  had  to  send  a  thousand  people  tomorrow  to  west  papua  for  example <comma> we  do  n't  have  a  thousand  police  officers  hanging  around  that  could  just  go  tomorrow  and  we  do  have  a  thousand  soldiers  that  could  go <period> so  when  we  have  to  send  someone <comma> we  send  the  military <comma> because  they  're  there <comma> they  're  available  and <comma> heck <comma> they  're  used  to  going  off  and  doing  these  things  and  living  by  themselves  and  not  having  all  this  extra  support <period> so  they  are  able  to  do  it  in  that  sense <period> but  they  are  n't  trained  in  the  same  way  that  police  officers  are  and  they  're  certainly  not  equipped  in  the  same  way  police  officers  are <period> and  so  this  has  raised  a  bunch  of  problems  for  them  when  dealing  with  these  sorts  of  issues <period> one  particular  thing  that  's  come  up  that  i  am  especially  interested  in  is  the  question  of  whether <comma> when  we  're  sending  military  personnel  to  do  these  sorts  of  jobs <comma> we  ought  to  be  equipping  them  differently <comma> and  in  particular <comma> whether  we  ought  to  be  giving  them  access  to  some  of  the  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons  that  police  have <period> since  they  're  doing  some  of  these  same  jobs <comma> maybe  they  should  have  some  of  those  things <period> and  of  course <comma> there  's  a  range  of  places  where  you'd  think  those  things  would  be  really  useful <period> so  for  example <comma> when  you've  got  military  checkpoints <period> if  people  are  approaching  these  checkpoints  and  the  military  personnel  there  are  unsure  whether  this  person  's  hostile  or  not <period> say  this  person  approaching  here <comma> and  they  say <comma> well  is  this  a  suicide  bomber  or  not <questionmark> have  they  got  something  hidden  under  their  clothing <questionmark> what  's  going  to  happen <questionmark> they  do  n't  know  whether  this  person  's  hostile  or  not <period> if  this  person  does  n't  follow  directions <comma> then  they  may  end  up  shooting  them  and  then  find  out  afterward  either <comma> yes <comma> we  shot  the  right  person <comma> or <comma> no <comma> this  was  just  an  innocent  person  who  did  n't  understand  what  was  going  on <period> so  if  they  had  non-lethal  weapons  then  they  would  say <comma> well  we  can  use  them  in  that  sort  of  situation <period> if  we  shoot  someone  who  was  n't  hostile <comma> at  least  we  have  n't  killed  them <period> another  situation <period> this  photo  is  actually  from  one  of  the  missions  in  the  balkans  in  the  late  1990s <period> situation  's  a  little  bit  different  where  perhaps  they  know  someone  who  's  hostile <comma> where  they've  got  someone  shooting  at  them  or  doing  something  else  that  's  clearly  hostile <comma> throwing  rocks <comma> whatever <period> but  if  they  respond <comma> there  's  a  range  of  other  people  around <comma> who  are  innocent  people  who  might  also  get  hurt <comma> be  collateral  damage  that  the  military  often  does  n't  want  to  talk  about <period> so  again <comma> they  would  say <comma> well  if  we  have  access  to  non-lethal  weapons <comma> if  we've  got  someone  we  know  is  hostile <comma> we  can  do  something  to  deal  with  them  and  know  that  if  we  hit  anyone  else  around  the  place <comma> at  least <comma> again <comma> we  're  not  going  to  kill  them <period> another  suggestion  has  been <comma> since  we  're  putting  so  many  robots  in  the  field <comma> we  can  see  the  time  coming  they  're  going  to  make  their  own  decisions  about  who  to  shoot  and  who  not  to  shoot  without  a  human  in  the  loop <period> and  so  the  suggestion  is <comma> well  hey <comma> if  we  're  going  to  send  robots  out  and  allow  them  to  do  this <comma> maybe  it  would  be  a  good  idea <comma> again <comma> with  these  things  if  they  were  armed  with  non-lethal  weapons  so  that  if  the  robot  makes  a  bad  decision  and  shoots  the  wrong  person <comma> again <comma> they  have  n't  actually  killed  them <period> now  there  's  a  whole  range  of  different  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons <comma> some  of  which  are  obviously  available  now <comma> some  of  which  they  're  developing <period> so  you've  got  traditional  things  like  pepper  spray <comma> oc <period> spray  up  at  the  top  there <comma> or  tasers  over  here <period> the  one  on  the  top  right  here  is  actually  a  dazzling  laser  intended  to  just  blind  the  person  momentarily  and  disorient  them <period> you've  got  non-lethal  shotgun  rounds  that  contain  rubber  pellets  instead  of  the  traditional  metal  ones <period> and  this  one  in  the  middle  here <comma> the  large  truck <comma> is  actually  called  the  active  denial  system <comma> something  the  us <period> military  is  working  on  at  the  moment <period> it  's  essentially  a  big  microwave  transmitter <period> it  's  sort  of  your  classic  idea  of  a  heat  ray <period> it  goes  out  to  a  really  long  distance <comma> compared  to  any  of  these  other  sorts  of  things <period> and  anybody  who  is  hit  with  this  feels  this  sudden  burst  of  heat  and  just  wants  to  get  out  of  the  way <period> it  is  a  lot  more  sophisticated  than  a  microwave  oven <comma> but  it  is  basically  boiling  the  water  molecules  in  the  very  surface  level  of  your  skin <period> so  you  feel  this  massive  heat <comma> and  you  go <comma> i  want  to  get  out  of  the  way <period> and  they  're  thinking <comma> well  this  will  be  really  useful  in  places  like  where  we  need  to  clear  a  crowd  out  of  a  particular  area <comma> if  the  crowd  is  being  hostile <period> if  we  need  to  keep  people  away  from  a  particular  place <comma> we  can  do  that  with  these  sorts  of  things <period> so  obviously  there  's  a  whole  range  of  different  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons  we  could  give  military  personnel  and  there  's  a  whole  range  of  situations  where  they  're  looking  a  them  and  saying <comma> hey <comma> these  things  could  be  really  useful <period> but  as  i  said <comma> the  military  and  the  police  are  very  different <period> yes <comma> you  do  n't  have  to  look  very  hard  at  this  to  recognize  the  fact  that  they  might  be  very  different <period> in  particular <comma> the  attitude  to  the  use  of  force  and  the  way  they  're  trained  to  use  force  is  especially  different <period> the  police <comma> and  knowing  because  i've  actually  helped  to  train  police <comma> police <comma> in  particular  western  jurisdictions  at  least <comma> are  trained  to  de-escalate  force <comma> to  try  and  avoid  using  force  wherever  possible <comma> and  to  use  lethal  force  only  as  an  absolute  last  resort <period> military  personnel  are  being  trained  for  war <comma> so  they  're  trained  that <comma> as  soon  as  things  go  bad <comma> their  first  response  is  lethal  force <period> the  moment  the  fecal  matter  hits  the  rotating  turbine <comma> you  can  start  shooting  at  people <period> so  their  attitudes  to  the  use  of  lethal  force  are  very  different <comma> and  i  think  it  's  fairly  obvious  that  their  attitude  to  the  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  would  also  be  very  different  from  what  it  is  with  the  police <period> and  since  we've  already  had  so  many  problems  with  police  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  in  various  ways <comma> i  thought  it  would  be  a  really  good  idea  to  look  at  some  of  those  things  and  try  to  relate  it  to  the  military  context <period> and  i  was  really  surprised  when  i  started  to  do  this <comma> to  see  that <comma> in  fact <comma> even  those  people  who  were  advocating  the  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  by  the  military  had  n't  actually  done  that <period> they  generally  seem  to  think <comma> well <comma> why  would  we  care  what  's  happened  with  the  police <questionmark> we  're  looking  at  something  different <period> and  did  n't  seem  to  recognize <comma> in  fact <comma> they  were  looking  at  pretty  much  the  same  stuff <period> so  i  actually  started  to  investigate  some  of  those  issues  and  have  a  look  at  the  way  that  police  use  non-lethal  weapons  when  they  're  introduced  and  some  of  the  problems  that  might  arise  out  of  those  sorts  of  things  when  they  actually  do  introduce  them <period> and  of  course <comma> being  australian <comma> i  started  looking  at  stuff  in  australia <comma> knowing <comma> again <comma> from  my  own  experience  about  various  times  when  non-lethal  weapons  have  been  introduced  in  australia <period> so  one  of  the  things  i  particularly  looked  at  was  the  use  of  oc <period> spray <comma> oleoresin  capsicum  spray <comma> pepper  spray <comma> by  australian  police  and  seeing  when  that  had  been  introduced <comma> what  had  happened  and  those  sorts  of  issues <period> and  one  study  that  i  found <comma> a  particularly  interesting  one <comma> was  actually  in  queensland <comma> because  they  had  a  trial  period  for  the  use  of  pepper  spray  before  they  actually  introduced  it  more  broadly <period> and  i  went  and  had  a  look  at  some  of  the  figures  here <period> now  when  they  introduced  oc <period> spray  in  queensland <comma> they  were  really  explicit <period> the  police  minister  had  a  whole  heap  of  public  statements  made  about  it <period> they  were  saying <comma> this  is  explicitly  intended  to  give  police  an  option  between  shouting  and  shooting <period> this  is  something  they  can  use  instead  of  a  firearm  in  those  situations  where  they  would  have  previously  had  to  shoot  someone <period> so  i  went  and  looked  at  all  of  these  police  shooting  figures <period> and  you  cannot  actually  find  them  very  easily  for  individual  australian  states <period> i  could  only  find  these  ones <period> this  is  from  a  australian  institute  of  criminology  report <period> as  you  can  see  from  the  fine  print <comma> if  you  can  read  it  at  the  top <comma> police  shooting  deaths  means  not  just  people  who  have  been  shot  by  police <comma> but  people  who  have  shot  themselves  in  the  presence  of  police <period> but  this  is  the  figures  across  the  entire  country <period> and  the  red  arrow  represents  the  point  where  queensland  actually  said <comma> yes <comma> this  is  where  we  're  going  to  give  all  police  officers  across  the  entire  state  access  to  oc <period> spray <period> so  you  can  see  there  were  six  deaths  sort  of  leading  up  to  it  every  year  for  a  number  of  years <period> there  was  a  spike <comma> of  course <comma> a  few  years  before <comma> but  that  was  n't  actually  queensland <period> anyone  know  where  that  was <questionmark> was  n't  port  arthur <comma> no <period> victoria <questionmark> yes <comma> correct <period> that  spike  was  all  victoria <period> so  it  was  n't  that  queensland  had  a  particular  problem  with  deaths  from  police  shootings  and  so  on <period> so  six  shootings  across  the  whole  country <comma> fairly  consistently  over  the  years  before <period> so  the  next  two  years  were  the  years  they  studied <comma> 2001 <comma> 2002 <period> anyone  want  to  take  a  stab  at  the  number  of  times <comma> given  how  they've  introduced  this <comma> the  number  of  times  police  in  queensland  used  oc <period> spray  in  that  period <questionmark> hundreds <questionmark> one <comma> three <period> thousand  is  getting  better <period> explicitly  introduced  as  an  alternative  to  the  use  of  lethal  force <comma> an  alternative  between  shouting  and  shooting <period> i  'm  going  to  go  out  on  a  limb  here  and  say  that  if  queensland  police  did  n't  have  oc <period> spray <comma> they  would  n't  have  shot  2,226  people  in  those  two  years <period> in  fact <comma> if  you  have  a  look  at  the  studies  that  they  were  looking  at <comma> the  material  they  were  collecting  and  examining <comma> you  can  see  the  suspects  were  only  armed  in  about  15  percent  of  cases  where  oc <period> spray  was  used <period> it  was  routinely  being  used  in  this  period <comma> and <comma> of  course <comma> still  is  routinely  used <comma> because  there  were  no  complaints  about  it <comma> not  within  the  context  of  this  study  anyway <comma> it  was  routinely  being  used  to  deal  with  people  who  were  violent <comma> who  were  potentially  violent <comma> and  also  quite  frequently  used  to  deal  with  people  who  were  simply  passively  non-compliant <period> this  person  is  not  doing  anything  violent <comma> but  they  just  wo  n't  do  what  we  want  them  to <period> they  're  not  obeying  the  directions  that  we  're  giving  them <comma> so  we  'll  give  them  a  shot  of  the  oc <period> spray <period> that  'll  speed  them  up <period> everything  will  work  out  better  that  way <period> this  was  something  explicitly  introduced  to  be  an  alternative  to  firearms <comma> but  it  's  being  routinely  used  to  deal  with  a  whole  range  of  other  sorts  of  problems <period> now  one  of  the  particular  issues  that  comes  up  with  military  use  of  non-lethal  weapons <comma> and  people  when  they  're  actually  saying <comma> well  hey <comma> there  might  be  some  problems <comma> there  's  a  couple  of  particular  problems  that  get  focused  on <period> one  of  those  problems  is  that  non-lethal  weapons  may  be  used  indiscriminately <period> one  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  military  use  of  force  is  that  you  have  to  be  discriminate <period> you  have  to  be  careful  about  who  you  're  shooting  at <period> so  one  of  the  problems  that  's  been  suggested  with  non-lethal  weapons  is  that  they  might  be  used  indiscriminately <comma> that  you  use  them  against  a  whole  range  of  people  because  you  do  n't  have  to  worry  so  much  anymore <period> and  in  fact <comma> one  particular  instance  where  i  think  that  actually  happens  where  you  can  look  at  it  was  the  dubrovka  theatre  siege  in  moscow  in  2002 <comma> which  probably  a  lot  of  you <comma> unlike  most  of  my  students  at  adfa <comma> are  actually  old  enough  to  remember <period> so  chechens  had  come  in  and  taken  control  of  the  theater <period> they  were  holding  something  like  700  people  hostage <period> they'd  released  a  bunch  of  people <comma> but  they  still  had  about  700  people  hostage <period> and  the  russian  special  military  police <comma> special  forces <comma> spetsnaz <comma> came  in  and  actually  stormed  the  theater <period> and  the  way  they  did  it  was  to  pump  the  whole  thing  full  of  anesthetic  gas <period> and  it  turned  out  that  lots  of  these  hostages  actually  died  as  a  result  of  inhaling  the  gas <period> it  was  used  indiscriminately <period> they  pumped  the  whole  theater  full  of  the  gas <period> and  it  's  no  surprise  that  people  died <comma> because  you  do  n't  know  how  much  of  this  gas  each  person  is  going  to  inhale <comma> what  position  they  're  going  to  fall  in  when  they  become  unconscious  and  so  on <period> there  were <comma> in  fact <comma> only  a  couple  of  people  who  got  shot  in  this  episode <period> so  when  they  had  a  look  at  it  afterward <comma> there  were  only  a  couple  of  people  who'd  apparently  been  shot  by  the  hostage  takers  or  shot  by  the  police  forces  coming  in  and  trying  to  deal  with  the  situation <period> virtually  everybody  that  got  killed  got  killed  from  inhaling  the  gas <period> the  final  toll  of  hostages  is  a  little  unclear <comma> but  it  's  certainly  a  few  more  than  that <comma> because  there  were  other  people  who  died  over  the  next  few  days <period> so  this  was  one  particular  problem  they  talked  about <comma> that  it  might  be  used  indiscriminately <period> second  problem  that  people  sometimes  talk  about  with  military  use  of  non-lethal  weapons <comma> and  it  's  actually  the  reason  why  in  the  chemical  weapons  convention <comma> it  's  very  clear  that  you  cannot  use  riot  control  agents  as  a  weapon  of  warfare <comma> the  problem  with  that  is  that  it  's  seen  that  sometimes  non-lethal  weapons  might  actually  be  used <comma> not  as  an  alternative  to  lethal  force <comma> but  as  a  lethal  force  multiplier <comma> that  you  use  non-lethal  weapons  first  so  that  your  lethal  weapons  will  actually  be  more  effective <period> the  people  you  're  going  to  be  shooting  at  are  n't  going  to  be  able  to  get  out  of  the  way <period> they  're  not  going  to  be  aware  of  what  's  happening  and  you  can  kill  them  better <period> and  in  fact <comma> that  's  exactly  what  happened  here <period> the  hostage  takers  who  had  been  rendered  unconscious  by  the  gas  were  not  taken  into  custody <comma> they  were  simply  shot  in  the  head <period> so  this  non-lethal  weapon  was  being  used <comma> in  fact <comma> in  this  case  as  a  lethal  force  multiplier  to  make  killing  more  effective  in  this  particular  situation <period> another  problem  that  i  just  want  to  quickly  mention  is  that  there  's  a  whole  heap  of  problems  with  the  way  that  people  actually  get  taught  to  use  non-lethal  weapons  and  get  trained  about  them  and  then  get  tested  and  so  on <period> because  they  get  tested  in  nice <comma> safe  environments <period> and  people  get  taught  to  use  them  in  nice <comma> safe  environments  like  this <comma> where  you  can  see  exactly  what  's  going  on <period> the  person  who  's  spraying  the  oc <period> spray  is  wearing  a  rubber  glove  to  make  sure  they  do  n't  get  contaminated  and  so  on <period> but  they  do  n't  ever  get  used  like  that <period> they  get  used  out  in  the  real  world <comma> like  in  texas <comma> like  this <period> i  confess <comma> this  particular  case  was  actually  one  that  piqued  my  interest  in  this <period> it  happened  while  i  was  working  as  a  research  fellow  at  the  us <period> naval  academy <period> and  news  reports  started  coming  up  about  this  situation  where  this  woman  was  arguing  with  the  police  officer <period> she  was  n't  violent <period> in  fact <comma> he  was  probably  six  inches  taller  than  me <comma> and  she  was  about  this  tall <period> and  eventually  she  said  to  him  well  i  'm  going  to  get  back  in  my  car <period> and  he  says <comma> if  you  get  back  into  your  car <comma> i  'm  going  to  tase  you <period> and  she  says <comma> oh <comma> go  ahead <period> tase  me  and  so  he  does <period> and  it  's  all  captured  by  the  video  camera  running  in  the  front  of  the  police  car <period> so  she  's  72 <comma> and  it  's  seen  that  this  is  the  most  appropriate  way  of  dealing  with  her <period> and  other  examples  of  the  same  sorts  of  things  with  other  people  where  you  think  where  you  think <comma> is  this  really  an  appropriate  way  to  use  non-lethal  weapons <questionmark> police  chief  fires  taser  into  14  year-old  girl  's  head <period> she  was  running  away <period> what  else  was  i  suppose  to  do <questionmark> or  florida <comma> police  taser  six  year-old  boy  at  elementary  school <period> and  they  clearly  learned  a  lot  from  it  because  in  the  same  district <comma> police  review  policy  after  children  shocked <comma> 2nd  child  shocked  by  taser  stun  gun  within  weeks <period> same  police  district <period> another  child  within  weeks  of  tasering  the  six  year-old  boy <period> just  in  case  you  think  it  's  only  going  to  happen  in  the  united  states <comma> it  happened  in  canada  as  well <period> and  a  colleague  of  mine  sent  me  this  one  from  london <period> but  my  personal  favorite  of  these  ones <comma> i  have  to  confess <comma> does  actually  come  from  the  united  states <comma> officers  taser  86  year-old  disabled  woman  in  her  bed <period> i  checked  the  reports  on  this  one <period> i  looked  at  it <period> i  was  really  surprised <period> apparently  she  took  up  a  more  threatening  position  in  her  bed <period> i  kid  you  not <period> that  's  exactly  what  it  said <period> she  took  up  a  more  threatening  position  in  her  bed <period> okay <period> but  i'd  remind  you  what  i  'm  talking  about <comma> i  'm  talking  about  military  uses  of  non-lethal  weapons <period> so  why  is  this  relevant <questionmark> because  police  are  actually  more  restrained  in  the  use  of  force  than  the  military  are <period> they  're  trained  to  be  more  restrained  in  the  use  of  force  than  the  military  are <period> they  're  trained  to  think  more <comma> to  try  and  de-escalate <period> so  if  you  have  these  problems  with  police  officers  with  non-lethal  weapons <comma> what  on  earth  would  make  you  think  it  's  going  to  be  better  with  military  personnel <questionmark> the  last  thing  that  i  would  just  like  to  say <comma> when  i  'm  talking  to  the  police  about  what  a  perfect  non-lethal  weapon  would  look  like <comma> they  almost  inevitably  say  the  same  thing <period> they  say <comma> well <comma> it  's  got  to  be  something  that  's  nasty  enough  that  people  do  n't  want  to  be  hit  with  this  weapon <period> so  if  you  threaten  to  use  it <comma> people  are  going  to  comply  with  it <comma> but  it  's  also  going  to  be  something  that  does  n't  leave  any  lasting  effects <period> in  other  words <comma> your  perfect  non-lethal  weapon  is  something  that  's  perfect  for  abuse <period> what  would  these  guys  have  done  if  they'd  had  access  to  tasers  or  to  a  manned <comma> portable  version  of  the  active  denial  system <comma> a  small  heat  ray  that  you  can  use  on  people  and  not  worry  about  it <period> so  i  think <comma> yes <comma> there  may  be  ways  that  non-lethal  weapons  are  going  to  be  great  in  these  situations <comma> but  there  's  also  a  whole  heap  of  problems  that  need  to  be  considered  as  well <period> thanks  very  much <period> okay <comma> i  have  no  idea  what  we  're  going  to  play <period> i  wo  n't  be  able  to  tell  you  what  it  is  until  it  happens <period> i  did  n't  realize  there  was  going  to  be  a  little  music  before <period> so  i  think  i  'm  going  to  start  with  what  i  just  heard <period> okay <comma> so  first  of  all <comma> let  's  welcome  mr.  jamire  williams  on  the  drums <comma> burniss  travis  on  the  bass <comma> and  mr.  christian  sands  on  the  piano <period> so  the  bandstand <comma> as  we  call  it <comma> this  is  an  incredible  space <period> it  is  really  a  sacred  space <period> and  one  of  the  things  that  is  really  sacred  about  it  is  that  you  have  no  opportunity  to  think  about  the  future <comma> or  the  past <period> you  really  are  alive  right  here  in  this  moment <period> there  are  so  many  decisions  being  made  when  you  walk  on  the  bandstand <period> we  had  no  idea  what  key  we  were  going  to  play  in <period> in  the  middle <comma> we  sort  of  made  our  way  into  a  song  called  titi  boom <period> but  that  could  have  happened <comma> maybe <comma> maybe  not <period> everyone  's  listening <period> we  're  responding <period> you  have  no  time  for  projected  ideas <period> so  the  idea  of  a  mistake <comma> from  the  perspective  of  a  jazz  musician <comma> it  's  easier  to  talk  about  someone  else  's  mistake <period> so  the  way  i  perceive  a  mistake  when  i  'm  on  the  bandstand <comma> first  of  all <comma> we  do  n't  really  see  it  as  a  mistake <period> the  only  mistake  lies  in  that  i  'm  not  able  to  perceive  what  it  is  that  someone  else  did <period> every  mistake  is  an  opportunity  in  jazz <period> so  it  's  hard  to  even  describe  what  a  funny  note  would  be <period> so  for  example <comma> if  i  played  a  color <comma> like  we  were  playing  on  a  palette <comma> that  sounded  like  this <period> so  if  christian  played  a  note <comma> like  play  an  f <period> see <comma> these  are  all  right  inside  of  the  color  palette <period> if  you  played  an  e <period> see <comma> these  all  lie  right  inside  of  this  general  emotional  palette  that  we  were  painting <period> if  you  played  an  f#  though <comma> to  most  people  's  ears <comma> they  would  perceive  that  as  a  mistake <period> so  i  'm  going  to  show  you <comma> we  're  going  to  play  just  for  a  second <period> and  we  're  going  to  play  on  this  palette <period> and  at  some  point <comma> christian  will  introduce  this  note <period> and  we  wo  n't  react  to  it <period> he  'll  introduce  it  for  a  second  and  then  i  'll  stop <comma> i  'll  talk  for  a  second <period> we  'll  see  what  happens  when  we  play  with  this  palette <period> so  someone  could  conceptually  perceive  that  as  a  mistake <period> the  only  way  that  i  would  say  it  was  a  mistake  is  in  that  we  did  n't  react  to  it <period> it  was  an  opportunity  that  was  missed <period> so  it  's  unpredictable <period> we  'll  paint  this  palette  again <period> he  'll  play  it <period> i  do  n't  know  how  we  'll  react  to  it <comma> but  something  will  change <period> we  'll  all  accept  his  ideas <comma> or  not <period> so  you  see <comma> he  played  this  note <period> i  ended  up  creating  a  melody  out  of  it <period> the  texture  changed  in  the  drums  this  time <period> it  got  a  little  bit  more  rhythmic <comma> a  little  bit  more  intense  in  response  to  how  i  responded  to  it <period> so  there  is  no  mistake <period> the  only  mistake  is  if  i  'm  not  aware <comma> if  each  individual  musician  is  not  aware  and  accepting  enough  of  his  fellow  band  member  to  incorporate  the  idea  and  we  do  n't  allow  for  creativity <period> so  jazz <comma> this  bandstand  is  absolutely  amazing <period> it  's  a  very  purifying  experience <period> and  i  know  that  i  speak  for  all  of  us  when  i  tell  you  that  we  do  n't  take  it  for  granted <period> we  know  that  to  be  able  to  come  on  the  bandstand  and  play  music  is  a  blessing <period> so  how  does  this  all  relate  to  behavioral  finance <questionmark> well  we  're  jazz  musicians <comma> so  stereotypically  we  do  n't  have  a  great  relationship  to  finance <period> anyway <comma> i  just  wanted  to  sort  of  point  out  the  way  that  we  handle  it <period> and  the  other  dynamic  of  it  is  that  we  do  n't  micromanage  in  jazz <period> you  have  some  people  who  do <period> but  what  that  does  is  it  actually  limits  the  artistic  possibilities <period> if  i  come  up  and  i  dictate  to  the  band  that  i  want  to  play  like  this  and  i  want  the  music  to  go  this  way <comma> and  i  just  jump  right  in <period> ready <comma> just  play  some  time <period> one <comma> two <comma> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <period> it  's  kind  of  chaotic  because  i  'm  bullying  my  ideas <period> i  'm  telling  them <comma> you  come  with  me  over  this  way <period> if  i  really  want  the  music  to  go  there <comma> the  best  way  for  me  to  do  it  is  to  listen <period> this  is  a  science  of  listening <period> it  has  far  more  to  do  with  what  i  can  perceive  than  what  it  is  that  i  can  do <period> so  if  i  want  the  music  to  get  to  a  certain  level  of  intensity <comma> the  first  step  for  me  is  to  be  patient <comma> to  listen  to  what  's  going  on  and  pull  from  something  that  's  going  on  around  me <period> when  you  do  that <comma> you  engage  and  inspire  the  other  musicians  and  they  give  you  more <comma> and  gradually  it  builds <period> watch <period> one <comma> two <comma> a  one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <period> totally  different  experience  when  i  'm  pulling  ideas <period> it  's  much  more  organic <period> it  's  much  more  nuanced <period> it  's  not  about  bullying  my  vision  or  anything  like  that <period> it  's  about  being  here  in  the  moment <comma> accepting  one  another  and  allowing  creativity  to  flow <period> thank  you <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  today  about  saving  more <comma> but  not  today <comma> tomorrow <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  save  more  tomorrow <period> it  's  a  program  that  richard  thaler  from  the  university  of  chicago  and  i  devised  maybe  15  years  ago <period> the  program <comma> in  a  sense <comma> is  an  example  of  behavioral  finance  on  steroids <comma> how  we  could  really  use  behavioral  finance <period> now  you  might  ask <comma> what  is  behavioral  finance <questionmark> so  let  's  think  about  how  we  manage  our  money <period> let  's  start  with  mortgages <period> it  's  kind  of  a  recent  topic <comma> at  least  in  the  us <period> a  lot  of  people  buy  the  biggest  house  they  can  afford <comma> and  actually  slightly  bigger  than  that <period> and  then  they  foreclose <period> and  then  they  blame  the  banks  for  being  the  bad  guys  who  gave  them  the  mortgages <period> let  's  also  think  about  how  we  manage  risks <comma> for  example <comma> investing  in  the  stock  market <period> two  years  ago <comma> three  years  ago <comma> about  four  years  ago <comma> markets  did  well <period> we  were  risk  takers <comma> of  course <period> then  market  stocks  seize  and  we  're  like <comma> wow <period> these  losses <comma> they  feel <comma> emotionally <comma> they  feel  very  different  from  what  we  actually  thought  about  it  when  markets  were  going  up  so  we  're  probably  not  doing  a  great  job  when  it  comes  to  risk  taking <period> how  many  of  you  have  iphones <questionmark> anyone <questionmark> wonderful <period> i  would  bet  many  more  of  you  insure  your  iphone <comma> you  're  implicitly  buying  insurance  by  having  an  extended  warranty <period> what  if  you  lose  your  iphone <questionmark> what  if  you  do  this <questionmark> how  many  of  you  have  kids <questionmark> anyone <questionmark> keep  your  hands  up  if  you  have  sufficient  life  insurance <period> i  see  a  lot  of  hands  coming  down <period> i  would  predict <comma> if  you  're  a  representative  sample <comma> that  many  more  of  you  insure  your  iphones  than  your  lives <comma> even  when  you  have  kids <period> we  're  not  doing  that  well  when  it  comes  to  insurance <period> the  average  american  household  spends  1,000  dollars  a  year  on  lotteries <period> and  i  know  it  sounds  crazy <period> how  many  of  you  spend  a  thousand  dollars  a  year  on  lotteries <questionmark> no  one <period> so  that  tells  us  that  the  people  not  in  this  room  are  spending  more  than  a  thousand  to  get  the  average  to  a  thousand <period> low-income  people  spend  a  lot  more  than  a  thousand  on  lotteries <period> so  where  does  it  take  us <questionmark> we  're  not  doing  a  great  job  managing  money <period> behavioral  finance  is  really  a  combination  of  psychology  and  economics <comma> trying  to  understand  the  money  mistakes  people  make <period> and  i  can  keep  standing  here  for  the  12  minutes  and  53  seconds  that  i  have  left  and  make  fun  of  all  sorts  of  ways  we  manage  money <comma> and  at  the  end  you  're  going  to  ask <comma> how  can  we  help  people <questionmark> and  that  's  what  i  really  want  to  focus  on  today <period> how  do  we  take  an  understanding  of  the  money  mistakes  people  make <comma> and  then  turning  the  behavioral  challenges  into  behavioral  solutions <questionmark> and  what  i  'm  going  to  talk  about  today  is  save  more  tomorrow <period> i  want  to  address  the  issue  of  savings <period> we  have  on  the  screen  a  representative  sample  of  100  americans <period> and  we  're  going  to  look  at  their  saving  behavior <period> first  thing  to  notice  is <comma> half  of  them  do  not  even  have  access  to  a  401  plan <period> they  cannot  make  savings  easy <period> they  cannot  have  money  go  away  from  their  paycheck  into  a  401  plan  before  they  see  it <comma> before  they  can  touch  it <period> what  about  the  remaining  half  of  the  people <questionmark> some  of  them  elect  not  to  save <period> they  're  just  too  lazy <period> they  never  get  around  to  logging  into  a  complicated  website  and  doing  17  clicks  to  join  the  401  plan <period> and  then  they  have  to  decide  how  they  're  going  to  invest  in  their  52  choices <comma> and  they  never  heard  about  what  is  a  money  market  fund <period> and  they  get  overwhelmed  and  the  just  do  n't  join <period> how  many  people  end  up  saving  to  a  401  plan <questionmark> one  third  of  americans <period> two  thirds  are  not  saving  now <period> are  they  saving  enough <questionmark> take  out  those  who  say  they  save  too  little <period> one  out  of  10  are  saving  enough <period> nine  out  of  10  either  cannot  save  through  their  401  plan <comma> decide  not  to  save <comma> or  do  n't  decide <comma> or  save  too  little <period> we  think  we  have  a  problem  of  people  saving  too  much <period> let  's  look  at  that <period> we  have  one  person <comma> well <comma> actually  we  're  going  to  slice  him  in  half  because  it  's  less  than  one  percent <period> roughly  half  a  percent  of  americans  feel  that  they  save  too  much <period> what  are  we  going  to  do  about  it <questionmark> that  's  what  i  really  want  to  focus  on <period> we  have  to  understand  why  people  are  not  saving <comma> and  then  we  can  hopefully  flip  the  behavioral  challenges  into  behavioral  solutions <comma> and  then  see  how  powerful  it  might  be <period> so  let  me  divert  for  a  second  as  we  're  going  to  identify  the  problems <comma> the  challenges <comma> the  behavioral  challenges <comma> that  prevent  people  from  saving <period> i  'm  going  to  divert  and  talk  about  bananas  and  chocolate <period> suppose  we  had  another  wonderful  ted  event  next  week <period> and  during  the  break  there  would  be  a  snack  and  you  could  choose  bananas  or  chocolate <period> how  many  of  you  think  you  would  like  to  have  bananas  during  this  hypothetical  ted  event  next  week <questionmark> who  would  go  for  bananas <questionmark> wonderful <period> i  predict  scientifically  74  percent  of  you  will  go  for  bananas <period> well  that  's  at  least  what  one  wonderful  study  predicted <period> and  then  count  down  the  days  and  see  what  people  ended  up  eating <period> the  same  people  that  imagined  themselves  eating  the  bananas  ended  up  eating  chocolates  a  week  later <period> self-control  is  not  a  problem  in  the  future <period> it  's  only  a  problem  now  when  the  chocolate  is  next  to  us <period> what  does  it  have  to  do  with  time  and  savings <comma> this  issue  of  immediate  gratification <questionmark> or  as  some  economists  call  it <comma> present  bias <period> we  think  about  saving <period> we  know  we  should  be  saving <period> we  know  we  'll  do  it  next  year <comma> but  today  let  us  go  and  spend <period> christmas  is  coming <period> we  might  as  well  buy  a  lot  of  gifts  for  everyone  we  know <period> so  this  issue  of  present  bias  causes  us  to  think  about  saving <comma> but  end  up  spending <period> let  me  now  talk  about  another  behavioral  obstacle  to  saving  having  to  do  with  inertia <period> but  again <comma> a  little  diversion  to  the  topic  of  organ  donation <period> wonderful  study  comparing  different  countries <period> we  're  going  to  look  at  two  similar  countries <comma> germany  and  austria <period> and  in  germany <comma> if  you  would  like  to  donate  your  organs <comma> god  forbid  something  really  bad  happens  to  you <comma> when  you  get  your  driving  license  or  an  id <comma> you  check  the  box  saying <comma> i  would  like  to  donate  my  organs <period> not  many  people  like  checking  boxes <period> it  takes  effort <period> you  need  to  think <period> twelve  percent  do <period> austria <comma> a  neighboring  country <comma> slightly  similar <comma> slightly  different <period> what  's  the  difference <questionmark> well <comma> you  still  have  choice <period> you  will  decide  whether  you  want  to  donate  your  organs  or  not <period> but  when  you  get  your  driving  license <comma> you  check  the  box  if  you  do  not  want  to  donate  your  organ <period> nobody  checks  boxes <period> that  's  kind  of  too  much  effort <period> one  percent  check  the  box <period> the  rest  do  nothing <period> doing  nothing  is  very  common <period> not  many  people  check  boxes <period> what  are  the  implications  to  saving  lives  and  having  organs  available <questionmark> in  germany <comma> 12  percent  check  the  box <period> twelve  percent  are  organ  donors <period> huge  shortage  of  organs <comma> god  forbid <comma> if  you  need  one <period> in  austria <comma> again <comma> nobody  checks  the  box <period> therefore <comma> 99  percent  of  people  are  organ  donors <period> inertia <comma> lack  of  action <period> what  is  the  default  setting  if  people  do  nothing <comma> if  they  keep  procrastinating <comma> if  they  do  n't  check  the  boxes <questionmark> very  powerful <period> we  're  going  to  talk  about  what  happens  if  people  are  overwhelmed  and  scared  to  make  their  401  choices <period> are  we  going  to  make  them  automatically  join  the  plan <comma> or  are  they  going  to  be  left  out <questionmark> in  too  many  401  plans <comma> if  people  do  nothing <comma> it  means  they  're  not  saving  for  retirement <comma> if  they  do  n't  check  the  box <period> and  checking  the  box  takes  effort <period> so  we've  chatted  about  a  couple  of  behavioral  challenges <period> one  more  before  we  flip  the  challenges  into  solutions <comma> having  to  do  with  monkeys  and  apples <period> no <comma> no <comma> no <comma> this  is  a  real  study  and  it  's  got  a  lot  to  do  with  behavioral  economics <period> one  group  of  monkeys  gets  an  apple <comma> they  're  pretty  happy <period> the  other  group  gets  two  apples <comma> one  is  taken  away <period> they  still  have  an  apple  left <period> they  're  really  mad <period> why  have  you  taken  our  apple <questionmark> this  is  the  notion  of  loss  aversion <period> we  hate  losing  stuff <comma> even  if  it  does  n't  mean  a  lot  of  risk <period> you  would  hate  to  go  to  the  atm <comma> take  out  100  dollars  and  notice  that  you  lost  one  of  those  $20  bills <period> it  's  very  painful <comma> even  though  it  does  n't  mean  anything <period> those  20  dollars  might  have  been  a  quick  lunch <period> so  this  notion  of  loss  aversion  kicks  in  when  it  comes  to  savings  too <comma> because  people <comma> mentally  and  emotionally  and  intuitively  frame  savings  as  a  loss  because  i  have  to  cut  my  spending <period> so  we  talked  about  all  sorts  of  behavioral  challenges  having  to  do  with  savings  eventually <period> whether  you  think  about  immediate  gratification <comma> and  the  chocolates  versus  bananas <comma> it  's  just  painful  to  save  now <period> it  's  a  lot  more  fun  to  spend  now <period> we  talked  about  inertia  and  organ  donations  and  checking  the  box <period> if  people  have  to  check  a  lot  of  boxes  to  join  a  401  plan <comma> they  're  going  to  keep  procrastinating  and  not  join <period> and  last <comma> we  talked  about  loss  aversion <comma> and  the  monkeys  and  the  apples <period> if  people  frame  mentally  saving  for  retirement  as  a  loss <comma> they  're  not  going  to  be  saving  for  retirement <period> so  we've  got  these  challenges <comma> and  what  richard  thaler  and  i  were  always  fascinated  by <comma> take  behavioral  finance <comma> make  it  behavioral  finance  on  steroids  or  behavioral  finance  20  or  behavioral  finance  in  action <comma> flip  the  challenges  into  solutions <period> and  we  came  up  with  an  embarrassingly  simple  solution  called  save  more <comma> not  today <comma> tomorrow <period> how  is  it  going  to  solve  the  challenges  we  chatted  about <questionmark> if  you  think  about  the  problem  of  bananas  versus  chocolates <comma> we  think  we  're  going  to  eat  bananas  next  week <period> we  think  we  're  going  to  save  more  next  year <period> save  more  tomorrow  invites  employees  to  save  more  maybe  next  year <comma> sometime  in  the  future  when  we  can  imagine  ourselves  eating  bananas <comma> volunteering  more  in  the  community <comma> exercising  more  and  doing  all  the  right  things  on  the  planet <period> now  we  also  talked  about  checking  the  box  and  the  difficulty  of  taking  action <period> save  more  tomorrow  makes  it  easy <period> it  's  an  autopilot <period> once  you  tell  me  you  would  like  to  save  more  in  the  future <comma> let  's  say  every  january  you  're  going  to  be  saving  more  automatically  and  it  's  going  to  go  away  from  your  paycheck  to  the  401  plan  before  you  see  it <comma> before  you  touch  it <comma> before  you  get  the  issue  of  immediate  gratification <period> but  what  are  we  going  to  do  about  the  monkeys  and  loss  aversion <questionmark> next  january  comes  and  people  might  feel  that  if  they  save  more <comma> they  have  to  spend  less <comma> and  that  's  painful <period> well <comma> maybe  it  should  n't  be  just  january <period> maybe  we  should  make  people  save  more  when  they  make  more  money <period> that  way <comma> when  they  make  more  money <comma> when  they  get  a  pay  raise <comma> they  do  n't  have  to  cut  their  spending <period> they  take  a  little  bit  of  the  increase  in  the  paycheck  home  and  spend  more <comma> take  a  little  bit  of  the  increase  and  put  it  in  a  401  plan <period> so  that  is  the  program <comma> embarrassingly  simple <comma> but  as  we  're  going  to  see <comma> extremely  powerful <period> we  first  implemented  it <comma> richard  thaler  and  i <comma> back  in  1998 <period> mid-sized  company  in  the  midwest <comma> blue  collar  employees  struggling  to  pay  their  bills  repeatedly  told  us  they  cannot  save  more  right  away <period> saving  more  today  is  not  an  option <period> we  invited  them  to  save  three  percentage  points  more  every  time  they  get  a  pay  raise <period> and  here  are  the  results <period> we  're  seeing  here  a  three  and  a  half-year  period <comma> four  pay  raises <comma> people  who  were  struggling  to  save <comma> were  saving  three  percent  of  their  paycheck <comma> three  and  a  half  years  later  saving  almost  four  times  as  much <comma> almost  14  percent <period> and  there  's  shoes  and  bicycles  and  things  on  this  chart  because  i  do  n't  want  to  just  throw  numbers  in  a  vacuum <period> i  want <comma> really <comma> to  think  about  the  fact  that  saving  four  times  more  is  a  huge  difference  in  terms  of  the  lifestyle  that  people  will  be  able  to  afford <period> it  's  real <period> it  's  not  just  numbers  on  a  piece  of  paper <period> whereas  with  saving  three  percent <comma> people  might  have  to  add  nice  sneakers  so  they  can  walk <comma> because  they  wo  n't  be  able  to  afford  anything  else <comma> when  they  save  14  percent  they  might  be  able  to  maybe  have  nice  dress  shoes  to  walk  to  the  car  to  drive <period> this  is  a  real  difference <period> by  now <comma> about  60  percent  of  the  large  companies  actually  have  programs  like  this  in  place <period> it  's  been  part  of  the  pension  protection  act <period> and  needless  to  say  that  thaler  and  i  have  been  blessed  to  be  part  of  this  program  and  make  a  difference <period> let  me  wrap  with  two  key  messages <period> one  is  behavioral  finance  is  extremely  powerful <period> this  is  just  one  example <period> message  two  is  there  's  still  a  lot  to  do <period> this  is  really  the  tip  of  the  iceberg <period> if  you  think  about  people  and  mortgages  and  buying  houses  and  then  not  being  able  to  pay  for  it <comma> we  need  to  think  about  that <period> if  you  're  thinking  about  people  taking  too  much  risk  and  not  understanding  how  much  risk  they  're  taking  or  taking  too  little  risk <comma> we  need  to  think  about  that <period> if  you  think  about  people  spending  a  thousand  dollars  a  year  on  lottery  tickets <comma> we  need  to  think  about  that <period> the  average  actually <comma> the  record  is  in  singapore <period> the  average  household  spends  $4,000  a  year  on  lottery  tickets <period> we've  got  a  lot  to  do <comma> a  lot  to  solve <comma> also  in  the  retirement  area  when  it  comes  to  what  people  do  with  their  money  after  retirement <period> one  last  question <comma> how  many  of  you  feel  comfortable  that  as  you  're  planning  for  retirement  you  have  a  really  solid  plan  when  you  're  going  to  retire <comma> when  you  're  going  to  claim  social  security  benefits <comma> what  lifestyle  to  expect <comma> how  much  to  spend  every  month  so  you  're  not  going  to  run  out  of  money <questionmark> how  many  of  you  feel  you  have  a  solid  plan  for  the  future  when  it  comes  to  post-retirement  decisions <period> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <period> less  than  three  percent  of  a  very  sophisticated  audience <period> behavioral  finance  has  a  long  way <period> there  's  a  lot  of  opportunities  to  make  it  powerful  again  and  again  and  again <period> thank  you <period> i  'll  just  take  you  to  bangladesh  for  a  minute <period> before  i  tell  that  story <comma> we  should  ask  ourselves  the  question <comma> why  does  poverty  exist <questionmark> i  mean <comma> there  is  plenty  of  knowledge  and  scientific  breakthroughs <period> we  all  live  in  the  same  planet <comma> but  there  's  still  a  great  deal  of  poverty  in  the  world <period> and  i  think <comma> so  i  want  to  throw  a  perspective  that  i  have <comma> so  that  we  can  assess  this  project <comma> or  any  other  project <comma> for  that  matter <comma> to  see  whether  it  's  contributing  or <comma> contributing  to  poverty  or  trying  to  alleviate  it <period> rich  countries  have  been  sending  aid  to  poor  countries  for  the  last  60  years <period> and  by  and  large <comma> this  has  failed <period> and  you  can  see  this  book <comma> written  by  someone  who  worked  in  the  world  bank  for  20  years <comma> and  he  finds  economic  growth  in  this  country  to  be  elusive <period> by  and  large <comma> it  did  not  work <period> so  the  question  is <comma> why  is  that <questionmark> in  my  mind <comma> there  is  something  to  learn  from  the  history  of  europe <period> i  mean <comma> even  here <comma> yesterday  i  was  walking  across  the  street <comma> and  they  showed  three  bishops  were  executed  500  years  ago <comma> right  across  the  street  from  here <period> so  my  point  is <comma> there  's  a  lot  of  struggle  has  gone  in  europe <comma> where  citizens  were  empowered  by  technologies <period> and  they  demanded  authorities  from <comma> to  come  down  from  their  high  horses <period> and  in  the  end <comma> there  's  better  bargaining  between  the  authorities  and  citizens <comma> and  democracies <comma> capitalism <comma> everything  else  flourished <period> and  so  you  can  see <comma> the  real  process  of <comma> and  this  is  backed  up  by  this  500-page  book <comma> that  the  authorities  came  down  and  citizens  got  up <period> but  if  you  look <comma> if  you  have  that  perspective <comma> then  you  can  see  what  happened  in  the  last  60  years <period> aid  actually  did  the  opposite <period> it  empowered  authorities <period> and <comma> as  a  result <comma> marginalized  citizens <period> the  authorities  did  not  have  the  reason  to  make  economic  growth  happen  so  that  they  could  tax  people  and  make  more  money  for  to  run  their  business <period> because  they  were  getting  it  from  abroad <period> and  in  fact <comma> if  you  see  oil-rich  countries <comma> where  citizens  are  not  yet  empowered <comma> the  same  thing  goes  -- <period> nigeria <comma> saudi  arabia <comma> all  sorts  of  countries <period> because  the  aid  and  oil  or  mineral  money  acts  the  same  way <period> it  empowers  authorities <comma> without  activating  the  citizens <comma> their  hands <comma> legs <comma> brains <comma> what  have  you <period> and  if  you  agree  with  that <comma> then  i  think  the  best  way  to  improve  these  countries  is  to  recognize  that  economic  development  is  of  the  people <comma> by  the  people <comma> for  the  people <period> and  that  is  the  real  network  effect <period> if  citizens  can  network  and  make  themselves  more  organized  and  productive <comma> so  that  their  voices  are  heard <comma> so  then  things  would  improve <period> and  to  contrast  that <comma> you  can  see  the  most  important  institution  in  the  world <comma> the  world  bank <comma> is  an  organization  of  the  government <comma> by  the  government <comma> for  the  governments <period> just  see  the  contrast <period> and  that  is  the  perspective  i  have <comma> and  then  i  can  start  my  story <period> of  course <comma> how  would  you  empower  citizens <questionmark> there  could  be  all  sorts  of  technologies <period> and  one  is  cell  phones <period> recently  the  economist  recognized  this <comma> but  i  stumbled  upon  the  idea  12  years  ago <comma> and  that  's  what  i've  been  working  on <period> so  12  years  ago <comma> i  was  trying  to  be  an  investment  banker  in  new  york <period> we  had <comma> quite  a  few  our  colleagues  were  connected  by  a  computer  network <period> and  we  got  more  productive  because  we  did  n't  have  to  exchange  floppy  disks <period> we  could  update  each  other  more  often <period> but  one  time  it  broke  down <period> and  it  reminded  me  of  a  day  in  1971 <period> there  was  a  war  going  on  in  my  country <period> and  my  family  moved  out  of  an  urban  place <comma> where  we  used  to  live <comma> to  a  remote  rural  area  where  it  was  safer <period> and  one  time  my  mother  asked  me  to  get  some  medicine  for  a  younger  sibling <period> and  i  walked  10  miles  or  so <comma> all  morning <comma> to  get  there <comma> to  the  medicine  man <period> and  he  was  n't  there <comma> so  i  walked  all  afternoon  back <period> so  i  had  another  unproductive  day <period> so  while  i  was  sitting  in  a  tall  building  in  new  york <comma> i  put  those  two  experiences  together  side  by  side <comma> and  basically  concluded  that  connectivity  is  productivity <comma> whether  it  's  in  a  modern  office  or  an  underdeveloped  village <period> so  naturally <comma> i <comma> the  implication  of  that  is  that  the  telephone  is  a  weapon  against  poverty <period> and  if  that  's  the  case <comma> then  the  question  is  how  many  telephones  did  we  have  at  that  time <questionmark> and  it  turns  out <comma> that  there  was  one  telephone  in  bangladesh  for  every  500  people <period> and  all  those  phones  were  in  the  few  urban  places <period> the  vast  rural  areas <comma> where  100  million  people  lived <comma> there  were  no  telephones <period> so  just  imagine  how  many  man-months  or  man-years  are  wasted <comma> just  like  i  wasted  a  day <period> if  you  just  multiply  by  100  million  people <comma> let  's  say  losing  one  day  a  month <comma> whatever <comma> and  you  see  a  vast  amount  of  resource  wasted <period> and  after  all <comma> poor  countries <comma> like  rich  countries <comma> one  thing  we've  got  equal <comma> is  their  days  are  the  same  length <comma> 24  hours <period> so  if  you  lose  that  precious  resource <comma> where  you  are  somewhat  equal  to  the  richer  countries <comma> that  's  a  huge  waste <period> so  i  started  looking  for  any  evidence  that <comma> does  connectivity  really  increase  productivity <questionmark> and  i  could  n't  find  much <comma> really <comma> but  i  found  this  graph  produced  by  the  itu <comma> which  is  the  international  telecommunication  union <comma> based  in  geneva <period> they  show  an  interesting  thing <period> that  you  see <comma> the  horizontal  axis  is  where  you  place  your  country <period> so  the  united  states  or  the  uk  would  be  here <comma> outside <period> and  so  the  impact  of  one  new  telephone <comma> which  is  on  the  vertical  axis <comma> is  very  little <period> but  if  you  come  back  to  a  poorer  country <comma> where  the  gnp  per  capita  is <comma> let  's  say <comma> 500  dollars <comma> or  300  dollars <comma> then  the  impact  is  huge <comma> 6,000  dollars <period> or  5,000  dollars <period> the  question  was <comma> how  much  did  it  cost  to  install  a  new  telephone  in  bangladesh <questionmark> it  turns  out <comma> 2,000  dollars <period> so  if  you  spend  2,000  dollars <comma> and  let  's  say  the  telephone  lasts  10  years <period> and  if  5,000  dollars  every  year <comma> so  that  's  50,000  dollars <period> so  obviously  this  was  a  gadget  to  have <period> and  of  course <comma> if  the  cost  of  installing  a  telephone  is  going  down <comma> because  there  's  a  digital  revolution  going  on <comma> then  it  would  be  even  more  dramatic <period> and  i  knew  a  little  economics  by  then <comma> it  says  adam  smith  taught  us  that  specialization  leads  to  productivity <period> but  how  would  you  specialize <questionmark> let  's  say  i  'm  a  fisherman  and  a  farmer <period> and  chris  is  a  fisherman  farmer <period> both  are  generalists <period> so  the  point  is  that  we  could  only <comma> the  only  way  we  could  depend  on  each  other <comma> is  if  we  can  connect  with  each  other <period> and  if  we  are  neighbors <comma> i  could  just  walk  over  to  his  house <period> but  then  we  are  limiting  our  economic  sphere  to  something  very  small  area <period> but  in  order  to  expand  that <comma> you  need  a  river <comma> or  you  need  a  highway <comma> or  you  need  telephone  lines <period> but  in  any  event <comma> it  's  connectivity  that  leads  to  dependability <period> and  that  leads  to  specialization <period> that  leads  to  productivity <period> so  the  question  was <comma> i  started  looking  at  this  issue <comma> and  going  back  and  forth  between  bangladesh  and  new  york <period> there  were  a  lot  of  reasons  people  told  me  why  we  do  n't  have  enough  telephones <period> and  one  of  them  is  the  lacking  buying  power <period> poor  people  apparently  do  n't  have  the  power  to  buy <period> but  the  point  is <comma> if  it  's  a  production  tool <comma> why  do  we  have  to  worry  about  that <questionmark> i  mean <comma> in  america <comma> people  buy  cars <comma> and  they  put  very  little  money  down <period> they  get  a  car <comma> and  they  go  to  work <period> the  work  pays  them  a  salary <period> the  salary  allows  them  to  pay  for  the  car  over  time <period> the  car  pays  for  itself <period> so  if  the  telephone  is  a  production  tool <comma> then  we  do  n't  quite  have  to  worry  about  the  purchasing  power <period> and  of  course <comma> even  if  that  's  true <comma> then  what  about  initial  buying  power <questionmark> so  then  the  question  is <comma> why  cannot  we  have  some  kind  of  shared  access <questionmark> in  the  united  states <comma> we  have <comma> everybody  needs  a  banking  service <comma> but  very  few  of  us  are  trying  to  buy  a  bank <period> so  it  's <comma> a  bank  tends  to  serve  a  whole  community <period> so  we  could  do  that  for  telephones <period> and  also  people  told  me  that  we  have  a  lot  of  important  primary  needs  to  meet <comma> food <comma> clothing <comma> shelter <comma> whatever <period> but  again <comma> it  's  very  paternalistic <period> you  should  be  raising  income  and  let  people  decide  what  they  want  to  do  with  their  money <period> but  the  real  problem  is  the  lack  of  other  infrastructures <period> see <comma> you  need  some  kind  of  infrastructure  to  bring  a  new  thing <period> for  instance <comma> the  internet  was  booming  in  the  us <period> because  there  were <comma> there  were  people  who  had  computers <period> they  had  modems <period> they  had  telephone  lines <comma> so  it  's  very  easy  to  bring  in  a  new  idea <comma> like  the  internet <period> but  that  's  what  's  lacking  in  a  poor  country <period> so  for  example <comma> we  did  n't  have  ways  to  have  credit  checks <comma> few  banks  to  collect  bills <comma> etc <period> but  that  's  why  i  noticed  grameen  bank <comma> which  is  a  bank  for  poor  people <comma> and  had  1,100  branches <comma> 12,000  employees <comma> 23  million  borrowers <period> and  they  had  these  branches <period> i  thought  i  could  put  cell  towers  and  create  a  network <period> and  anyway <comma> to  cut  the  time  short <comma> so  i  started <comma> i  first  went  to  them  and  said <comma> you  know <comma> perhaps  i  could  connect  all  your  branches  and  make  you  more  efficient <period> but  you  know <comma> they  have <comma> after  all <comma> evolved  in  a  country  without  telephones <comma> so  they  are  decentralized <period> i  mean <comma> of  course  there  might  be  other  good  reasons <comma> but  this  was  one  of  the  reasons <comma> they  had  to  be <period> and  so  they  were  not  that  interested  to  connect  all  their  branches <comma> and  then  to  be <comma> and  rock  the  boat <period> so  i  started  focusing <period> what  is  it  that  they  really  do <questionmark> so  what  happens  is  that  somebody  borrows  money  from  the  bank <period> she  typically  buys  a  cow <period> the  cow  gives  milk <period> and  she  sells  the  milk  to  the  villagers <comma> and  pays  off  the  loan <period> and  this  is  a  business  for  her <comma> but  it  's  milk  for  everybody  else <period> and  suddenly  i  realized  that  a  cell  phone  could  be  a  cow <period> because  some  way  she  could  borrow  200  dollars  from  the  bank <comma> get  a  phone  and  have  the  phone  for  everybody <period> and  it  's  a  business  for  her <period> so  i  wrote  to  the  bank <comma> and  they  thought  for  a  while <comma> and  they  said <comma> it  's  a  little  crazy <comma> but  logical <period> if  you  think  it  can  be  done <comma> come  and  make  it  happen <period> so  i  quit  my  job <period> i  went  back  to  bangladesh <period> i  created  a  company  in  america  called  gonofone <comma> which  in  bengali  means  people  's  phone <period> and  angel  investors  in  america  put  in  money  into  that <period> i  flew  around  the  world <period> after  about  a  million <comma> i  mean <comma> i  got  rejected  from  lots  of  places <comma> because  i  was  not  only  trying  to  go  to  a  poor  country <comma> i  was  trying  to  go  to  the  poor  of  the  poor  country <period> after  about  a  million  miles <comma> and  a  meaningful <comma> a  substantial  loss  of  hair <comma> i  eventually  put  together  a  consortium <comma> and <comma> which  involved  the  norwegian  telephone  company <comma> which  provided  the  know-how <comma> and  the  grameen  bank  provided  the  infrastructure  to  spread  the  service <period> to  make  the  story  short <comma> here  is  the  coverage  of  the  country <period> you  can  see  it  's  pretty  much  covered <period> even  in  bangladesh <comma> there  are  some  empty  places <period> but  we  are  also  investing  around  another  300  million  dollars  this  year  to  extend  that  coverage <period> now <comma> about  that  cow  model  i  talked  about <period> there  are  about  115,000  people  who  are  retailing  telephone  services  in  their  neighborhoods <period> and  it  's  serving  52,000  villages <comma> which  represent  about  80  million  people <period> and  these  phones  are  generating  about  100  million  dollars  for  the  company <period> and  two  dollars  profit  per  entrepreneur  per  day <comma> which  is  like  700  dollars  per  year <period> and  of  course <comma> it  's  very  beneficial  in  a  lot  of  ways <period> it  increases  income <comma> improves  welfare <comma> etc <period> and  the  result  is <comma> right  now <comma> this  company  is  the  largest  telephone  company <comma> with  35  million  subscribers <period> 115,000  of  these  phones  i  talked  about <comma> that  produces  about  a  third  of  the  traffic  in  the  network <period> and  2004 <comma> the  net  profit <comma> after  taxes <comma> very  serious  taxes <comma> was  120  million  dollars <period> and  the  company  contributed  about  190  million  dollars  to  the  government  coffers <period> and  again <comma> here  are  some  of  the  lessons <period> the  government  needs  to  provide  economically  viable  services <period> actually <comma> this  is  an  instance  where  private  companies  can  provide  that <period> governments  need  to  subsidize  private  companies <period> this  is  what  some  people  think <period> and  actually <comma> private  companies  help  governments  with  taxes <period> poor  people  are  recipients <period> poor  people  are  a  resource <period> services  cost  too  much  for  the  poor <period> their  involvement  reduces  the  cost <period> the  poor  are  uneducated  and  cannot  do  much <period> they  are  very  eager  learners  and  very  capable  survivors <period> i've  been  very  surprised <period> most  of  them  learn  how  to  operate  a  telephone  within  a  day <period> poor  countries  need  aid <period> businesses <comma> this  one  company  has  raised  the <comma> if  the  ideal  figures  are  even  five  percent  true <comma> this  one  company  is  raising  the  gnp  of  the  country  much  more  than  the  aid  the  country  receives <period> and  as  i  was  trying  to  show  you <comma> as  far  as  i  'm  concerned <comma> aid  does  damages  because  it  removes  the  government  from  its  citizens <period> and  this  is  a  new  project  i  have  with  dean  kamen <comma> the  famous  inventor  in  america <period> he  has  produced  some  power  generators <comma> which  we  are  now  doing  an  experiment  in  bangladesh <comma> in  two  villages  where  cow  manure  is  producing  biogas <comma> which  is  running  these  generators <period> and  each  of  these  generators  is  selling  electricity  to  20  houses  each <period> it  's  just  an  experiment <period> we  do  n't  know  how  far  it  will  go <comma> but  it  's  going  on <period> thank  you <period> how  many  of  you  had  to  fill  out  some  sort  of  web  form  where  you've  been  asked  to  read  a  distorted  sequence  of  characters  like  this <questionmark> how  many  of  you  found  it  really <comma> really  annoying <questionmark> okay <comma> outstanding <period> so  i  invented  that <period> or  i  was  one  of  the  people  who  did  it <period> that  thing  is  called  a  captcha <period> and  the  reason  it  is  there  is  to  make  sure  you <comma> the  entity  filling  out  the  form <comma> are  actually  a  human  and  not  some  sort  of  computer  program  that  was  written  to  submit  the  form  millions  and  millions  of  times <period> the  reason  it  works  is  because  humans <comma> at  least  non-visually-impaired  humans <comma> have  no  trouble  reading  these  distorted  squiggly  characters <comma> whereas  computer  programs  simply  cannot  do  it  as  well  yet <period> so  for  example <comma> in  the  case  of  ticketmaster <comma> the  reason  you  have  to  type  these  distorted  characters  is  to  prevent  scalpers  from  writing  a  program  that  can  buy  millions  of  tickets <comma> two  at  a  time <period> captchas  are  used  all  over  the  internet <period> and  since  they  're  used  so  often <comma> a  lot  of  times  the  precise  sequence  of  random  characters  that  is  shown  to  the  user  is  not  so  fortunate <period> so  this  is  an  example  from  the  yahoo  registration  page <period> the  random  characters  that  happened  to  be  shown  to  the  user  were  w <comma> a <comma> i <comma> t <comma> which <comma> of  course <comma> spell  a  word <period> but  the  best  part  is  the  message  that  the  yahoo  help  desk  got  about  20  minutes  later <period> text <comma> help <period> i've  been  waiting  for  over  20  minutes <comma> and  nothing  happens <period> this  person  thought  they  needed  to  wait <period> this  of  course <comma> is  not  as  bad  as  this  poor  person <period> captcha  project  is  something  that  we  did  here  at  carnegie  melllon  over  10  years  ago <comma> and  it  's  been  used  everywhere <period> let  me  now  tell  you  about  a  project  that  we  did  a  few  years  later <comma> which  is  sort  of  the  next  evolution  of  captcha <period> this  is  a  project  that  we  call  recaptcha <comma> which  is  something  that  we  started  here  at  carnegie  mellon <comma> then  we  turned  it  into  a  startup  company <period> and  then  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago <comma> google  actually  acquired  this  company <period> so  let  me  tell  you  what  this  project  started <period> so  this  project  started  from  the  following  realization <comma> it  turns  out  that  approximately  200  million  captchas  are  typed  everyday  by  people  around  the  world <period> when  i  first  heard  this <comma> i  was  quite  proud  of  myself <period> i  thought <comma> look  at  the  impact  that  my  research  has  had <period> but  then  i  started  feeling  bad <period> see  here  's  the  thing <comma> each  time  you  type  a  captcha <comma> essentially  you  waste  10  seconds  of  your  time <period> and  if  you  multiply  that  by  200  million <comma> you  get  that  humanity  as  a  whole  is  wasting  about  500,000  hours  every  day  typing  these  annoying  captchas <period> so  then  i  started  feeling  bad <period> and  then  i  started  thinking <comma> well <comma> of  course <comma> we  cannot  just  get  rid  of  captchas <comma> because  the  security  of  the  web  sort  of  depends  on  them <period> but  then  i  started  thinking <comma> is  there  any  way  we  can  use  this  effort  for  something  that  is  good  for  humanity <questionmark> while  you  're  typing  a  captcha <comma> during  those  10  seconds <comma> your  brain  is  doing  something  amazing <period> your  brain  is  doing  something  that  computers  cannot  yet  do <period> so  can  we  get  you  to  do  useful  work  for  those  10  seconds <questionmark> is  there  some  humongous  problem  that  we  cannot  yet  get  computers  to  solve <comma> yet  we  can  split  into  tiny  10-second  chunks  such  that  each  time  somebody  solves  a  captcha  they  solve  a  little  bit  of  this  problem <questionmark> and  the  answer  to  that  is  yes <comma> and  this  is  what  we  're  doing  now <period> so  what  you  may  not  know  is  that  nowadays  while  you  're  typing  a  captcha <comma> not  only  are  you  authenticating  yourself  as  a  human <comma> but  in  addition  you  're  actually  helping  us  to  digitize  books <period> so  let  me  explain  how  this  works <period> so  there  's  a  lot  of  projects  out  there  trying  to  digitize  books <period> google  has  one <period> the  internet  archive  has  one <period> amazon <comma> now  with  the  kindle <comma> is  trying  to  digitize  books <period> basically  the  way  this  works  is  you  start  with  an  old  book <period> you've  seen  those  things <comma> right <questionmark> like  a  book <questionmark> so  you  start  with  a  book <comma> and  then  you  scan  it <period> now  scanning  a  book  is  like  taking  a  digital  photograph  of  every  page  of  the  book <period> it  gives  you  an  image  for  every  page  of  the  book <period> this  is  an  image  with  text  for  every  page  of  the  book <period> the  next  step  in  the  process  is  that  the  computer  needs  to  be  able  to  decipher  all  of  the  words  in  this  image <period> that  's  using  a  technology  called  ocr <comma> for  optical  character  recognition <comma> which  takes  a  picture  of  text  and  tries  to  figure  out  what  text  is  in  there <period> now  the  problem  is  that  ocr  is  not  perfect <period> especially  for  older  books  where  the  ink  has  faded  and  the  pages  have  turned  yellow <comma> ocr  cannot  recognize  a  lot  of  the  words <period> for  example <comma> for  things  that  were  written  more  than  50  years  ago <comma> the  computer  cannot  recognize  about  30  percent  of  the  words <period> is  we  're  taking  all  of  the  words  that  the  computer  cannot  recognize  and  we  're  getting  people  to  read  them  for  us  while  they  're  typing  a  captcha  on  the  internet <period> so  the  next  time  you  type  a  captcha <comma> these  words  that  you  're  typing  are  actually  words  that  are  coming  from  books  that  are  being  digitized  that  the  computer  could  not  recognize <period> and  now  the  reason  we  have  two  words  nowadays  instead  of  one  is  because <comma> you  see <comma> one  of  the  words  is  a  word  that  the  system  just  got  out  of  a  book <comma> it  did  n't  know  what  it  was <comma> and  it  's  going  to  present  it  to  you <period> but  since  it  does  n't  know  the  answer  for  it <comma> it  cannot  grade  it  for  you <period> so  what  we  do  is  we  give  you  another  word <comma> one  for  which  the  system  does  know  the  answer <period> we  do  n't  tell  you  which  one  's  which <comma> and  we  say <comma> please  type  both <period> and  if  you  type  the  correct  word  for  the  one  for  which  the  system  already  knows  the  answer <comma> it  assumes  you  are  human <comma> and  it  also  gets  some  confidence  that  you  typed  the  other  word  correctly <period> and  if  we  repeat  this  process  to  like  10  different  people  and  all  of  them  agree  on  what  the  new  word  is <comma> then  we  get  one  more  word  digitized  accurately <period> so  this  is  how  the  system  works <period> and  basically <comma> since  we  released  it  about  three  or  four  years  ago <comma> a  lot  of  websites  have  started  switching  from  the  old  captcha  where  people  wasted  their  time  to  the  new  captcha  where  people  are  helping  to  digitize  books <period> so  for  example <comma> ticketmaster <period> so  every  time  you  buy  tickets  on  ticketmaster <comma> you  help  to  digitize  a  book <period> facebook <comma> every  time  you  add  a  friend  or  poke  somebody <comma> you  help  to  digitize  a  book <period> twitter  and  about  350,000  other  sites  are  all  using  recaptcha <period> and  in  fact <comma> the  number  of  sites  that  are  using  recaptcha  is  so  high  that  the  number  of  words  that  we  're  digitizing  per  day  is  really <comma> really  large <period> it  's  about  100  million  a  day <comma> which  is  the  equivalent  of  about  two  and  a  half  million  books  a  year <period> and  this  is  all  being  done  one  word  at  a  time  by  just  people  typing  captchas  on  the  internet <period> now  of  course <comma> since  we  're  doing  so  many  words  per  day <comma> funny  things  can  happen <period> and  this  is  especially  true  because  now  we  're  giving  people  two  randomly  chosen  english  words  next  to  each  other <period> so  funny  things  can  happen <period> for  example <comma> we  presented  this  word <period> it  's  the  word  christians <period> there  's  nothing  wrong  with  it <period> but  if  you  present  it  along  with  another  randomly  chosen  word <comma> bad  things  can  happen <period> so  we  get  this <period> but  it  's  even  worse <comma> because  the  particular  website  where  we  showed  this  actually  happened  to  be  called  the  embassy  of  the  kingdom  of  god <period> oops <period> here  's  another  really  bad  one <period> johnedwardscom  so  we  keep  on  insulting  people  left  and  right  everyday <period> now <comma> of  course <comma> we  're  not  just  insulting  people <period> see  here  's  the  thing <comma> since  we  're  presenting  two  randomly  chosen  words <comma> interesting  things  can  happen <period> so  this  actually  has  given  rise  to  a  really  big  internet  meme  that  tens  of  thousands  of  people  have  participated  in <comma> which  is  called  captcha  art <period> i  'm  sure  some  of  you  have  heard  about  it <period> here  's  how  it  works <period> imagine  you  're  using  the  internet  and  you  see  a  captcha  that  you  think  is  somewhat  peculiar <comma> like  this  captcha <period> then  what  you  're  supposed  to  do  is  you  take  a  screen  shot  of  it <period> then  of  course <comma> you  fill  out  the  captcha  because  you  help  us  digitize  a  book <period> but  then <comma> first  you  take  a  screen  shot <comma> and  then  you  draw  something  that  is  related  to  it <period> that  's  how  it  works <period> there  are  tens  of  thousands  of  these <period> some  of  them  are  very  cute <period> some  of  them  are  funnier <period> and  some  of  them <comma> like  paleontological  shvisle <comma> they  contain  snoop  dogg <period> okay <comma> so  this  is  my  favorite  number  of  recaptcha <period> so  this  is  the  favorite  thing  that  i  like  about  this  whole  project <period> this  is  the  number  of  distinct  people  that  have  helped  us  digitize  at  least  one  word  out  of  a  book  through  recaptcha <comma> 750  million <comma> which  is  a  little  over  10  percent  of  the  world  's  population <comma> has  helped  us  digitize  human  knowledge <period> and  it  is  numbers  like  these  that  motivate  my  research  agenda <period> so  the  question  that  motivates  my  research  is  the  following <comma> if  you  look  at  humanity  's  large-scale  achievements <comma> these  really  big  things  that  humanity  has  gotten  together  and  done  historically <comma> like  for  example <comma> building  the  pyramids  of  egypt  or  the  panama  canal  or  putting  a  man  on  the  moon <comma> there  is  a  curious  fact  about  them <comma> and  it  is  that  they  were  all  done  with  about  the  same  number  off  people <period> it  's  weird <period> they  were  all  done  with  about  100,000  people <period> and  the  reason  for  that  is  because <comma> before  the  internet <comma> coordinating  more  than  100,000  people <comma> let  alone  paying  them <comma> was  essentially  impossible <period> but  now  with  the  internet <comma> i've  just  shown  you  a  project  where  we've  gotten  750  million  people  to  help  us  digitize  human  knowledge <period> so  the  question  that  motivates  my  research  is <comma> if  we  can  put  a  man  on  the  moon  with  100,000 <comma> what  can  we  do  with  100  million <questionmark> so  based  on  this  question <comma> we've  had  a  lot  of  different  projects  that  we've  been  working  on <period> let  me  tell  you  about  one  that  i  'm  most  excited  about <period> this  is  something  that  we've  been  semi-quietly  working  on  for  the  last  year  and  a  half  or  so <period> it  has  n't  yet  been  launched <period> it  's  called  duolingo <period> since  it  has  n't  been  launched <comma> shhhhh <period> yeah <comma> i  can  trust  you  'll  do  that <period> so  this  is  the  project <period> here  's  how  it  started <period> it  started  with  me  posing  a  question  to  my  graduate  student <comma> severin  hacker <period> okay <comma> that  's  severin  hacker <period> so  i  posed  the  question  to  my  graduate  student <period> by  the  way <comma> you  did  hear  me  correctly <period> his  last  name  is  hacker <period> so  i  posed  this  question  to  him <comma> how  can  we  get  100  million  people  translating  the  web  into  every  major  language  for  free <questionmark> okay <comma> so  there  's  a  lot  of  things  to  say  about  this  question <period> first  of  all <comma> translating  the  web <period> so  right  now  the  web  is  partitioned  into  multiple  languages <period> a  large  fraction  of  it  is  in  english <period> if  you  do  n't  know  any  english <comma> you  cannot  access  it <period> but  there  's  large  fractions  in  other  different  languages <comma> and  if  you  do  n't  know  those  languages <comma> you  cannot  access  it <period> so  i  would  like  to  translate  all  of  the  web <comma> or  at  least  most  of  the  web <comma> into  every  major  language <period> so  that  's  what  i  would  like  to  do <period> now  some  of  you  may  say <comma> why  cannot  we  use  computers  to  translate <questionmark> why  cannot  we  use  machine  translation <questionmark> machine  translation  nowadays  is  starting  to  translate  some  sentences  here  and  there <period> why  cannot  we  use  it  to  translate  the  whole  web <questionmark> well  the  problem  with  that  is  that  it  's  not  yet  good  enough  and  it  probably  wo  n't  be  for  the  next  15  to  20  years <period> it  makes  a  lot  of  mistakes <period> even  when  it  does  n't  make  a  mistake <comma> since  it  makes  so  many  mistakes <comma> you  do  n't  know  whether  to  trust  it  or  not <period> so  let  me  show  you  an  example  of  something  that  was  translated  with  a  machine <period> actually  it  was  a  forum  post <period> it  was  somebody  who  was  trying  to  ask  a  question  about  javascript <period> it  was  translated  from  japanese  into  english <period> so  i  'll  just  let  you  read <period> this  person  starts  apologizing  for  the  fact  that  it  's  translated  with  a  computer <period> so  the  next  sentence  is  is  going  to  be  the  preamble  to  the  question <period> so  he  's  just  explaining  something <period> remember <comma> it  's  a  question  about  javascript <period> then  comes  the  first  part  of  the  question <period> then  comes  my  favorite  part  of  the  question <period> and  then  comes  the  ending <comma> which  is  my  favorite  part  of  the  whole  thing <period> okay <comma> so  computer  translation <comma> not  yet  good  enough <period> so  back  to  the  question <period> so  we  need  people  to  translate  the  whole  web <period> so  now  the  next  question  you  may  have  is <comma> well  why  cannot  we  just  pay  people  to  do  this <questionmark> we  could  pay  professional  language  translators  to  translate  the  whole  web <period> we  could  do  that <period> unfortunately <comma> it  would  be  extremely  expensive <period> for  example <comma> translating  a  tiny <comma> tiny  fraction  of  the  whole  web <comma> wikipedia <comma> into  one  other  language <comma> spanish <period> wikipedia  exists  in  spanish <comma> but  it  's  very  small  compared  to  the  size  of  english <period> it  's  about  20  percent  of  the  size  of  english <period> if  we  wanted  to  translate  the  other  80  percent  into  spanish <comma> it  would  cost  at  least  50  million  dollars <comma> and  this  is  at  even  the  most  exploited <comma> outsourcing  country  out  there <period> so  it  would  be  very  expensive <period> so  what  we  want  to  do  is  we  want  to  get  100  million  people  translating  the  web  into  every  major  language  for  free <period> now  if  this  is  what  you  want  to  do <comma> you  pretty  quickly  realize  you  're  going  to  run  into  two  pretty  big  hurdles <comma> two  big  obstacles <period> the  first  one  is  a  lack  of  bilinguals <period> so  i  do  n't  even  know  if  there  exists  100  million  people  out  there  using  the  web  who  are  bilingual  enough  to  help  us  translate <period> that  's  a  big  problem <period> the  other  problem  you  're  going  to  run  into  is  a  lack  of  motivation <period> how  are  we  going  to  motivate  people  to  actually  translate  the  web  for  free <questionmark> normally <comma> you  have  to  pay  people  to  do  this <period> so  how  are  we  going  to  motivate  them  to  do  it  for  free <questionmark> now  when  we  were  starting  to  think  about  this <comma> we  were  blocked  by  these  two  things <period> but  then  we  realized <comma> there  's  actually  a  way  to  solve  both  these  problems  with  the  same  solution <period> there  's  a  way  to  kill  two  birds  with  one  stone <period> and  that  is  to  transform  language  translation  into  something  that  millions  of  people  want  to  do <comma> and  that  also  helps  with  the  problem  of  lack  of  bilinguals <comma> and  that  is  language  education <period> so  it  turns  out  that  today <comma> there  are  over  12  billion  people  learning  a  foreign  language <period> people  really <comma> really  want  to  learn  a  foreign  language <period> and  it  's  not  just  because  they  're  being  forced  to  do  so  in  school <period> for  example <comma> in  the  united  states  alone <comma> there  are  over  five  million  people  who  have  paid  over  $500  for  software  to  learn  a  new  language <period> so  people  really <comma> really  want  to  learn  a  new  language <period> so  what  we've  been  working  on  for  the  last  year  and  a  half  is  a  new  website <comma> it  's  called  duolingo <comma> where  the  basic  idea  is  people  learn  a  new  language  for  free  while  simultaneously  translating  the  web <period> and  so  basically  they  're  learning  by  doing <period> so  the  way  this  works  is  whenever  you  're  a  just  a  beginner <comma> we  give  you  very <comma> very  simple  sentences <period> there  's <comma> of  course <comma> a  lot  of  very  simple  sentences  on  the  web <period> we  give  you  very <comma> very  simple  sentences  along  with  what  each  word  means <period> and  as  you  translate  them <comma> and  as  you  see  how  other  people  translate  them <comma> you  start  learning  the  language <period> and  as  you  get  more  and  more  advanced <comma> we  give  you  more  and  more  complex  sentences  to  translate <period> but  at  all  times <comma> you  're  learning  by  doing <period> now  the  crazy  thing  about  this  method  is  that  it  actually  really  works <period> first  of  all <comma> people  are  really <comma> really  learning  a  language <period> we  're  mostly  done  building  it <comma> and  now  we  're  testing  it <period> people  really  can  learn  a  language  with  it <period> and  they  learn  it  about  as  well  as  the  leading  language  learning  software <period> so  people  really  do  learn  a  language <period> and  not  only  do  they  learn  it  as  well <comma> but  actually  it  's  way  more  interesting <period> because  you  see  with  duolingo <comma> people  are  actually  learning  with  real  content <period> as  opposed  to  learning  with  made-up  sentences <comma> people  are  learning  with  real  content <comma> which  is  inherently  interesting <period> so  people  really  do  learn  a  language <period> but  perhaps  more  surprisingly <comma> the  translations  that  we  get  from  people  using  the  site <comma> even  though  they  're  just  beginners <comma> the  translations  that  we  get  are  as  accurate  as  those  of  professional  language  translators <comma> which  is  very  surprising <period> so  let  me  show  you  one  example <period> this  is  a  sentence  that  was  translated  from  german  into  english <period> the  top  is  the  german <period> the  middle  is  an  english  translation  that  was  done  by  somebody  who  was  a  professional  english  translator  who  we  paid  20  cents  a  word  for  this  translation <period> and  the  bottom  is  a  translation  by  users  of  duolingo <comma> none  of  whom  knew  any  german  before  they  started  using  the  site <period> you  can  see <comma> it  's  pretty  much  perfect <period> now  of  course <comma> we  play  a  trick  here  to  make  the  translations  as  good  as  professional  language  translators <period> we  combine  the  translations  of  multiple  beginners  to  get  the  quality  of  a  single  professional  translator <period> now  even  though  we  're  combining  the  translations <comma> the  site  actually  can  translate  pretty  fast <period> so  let  me  show  you <comma> this  is  our  estimates  of  how  fast  we  could  translate  wikipedia  from  english  into  spanish <period> remember <comma> this  is  50  million  dollars-worth  of  value <period> so  if  we  wanted  to  translate  wikipedia  into  spanish <comma> we  could  do  it  in  five  weeks  with  100,000  active  users <period> and  we  could  do  it  in  about  80  hours  with  a  million  active  users <period> since  all  the  projects  that  my  group  has  worked  on  so  far  have  gotten  millions  of  users <comma> we  're  hopeful  that  we  'll  be  able  to  translate  extremely  fast  with  this  project <period> now  the  thing  that  i  'm  most  excited  about  with  duolingo  is  i  think  this  provides  a  fair  business  model  for  language  education <period> so  here  's  the  thing <comma> the  current  business  model  for  language  education  is  the  student  pays <comma> and  in  particular <comma> the  student  pays  rosetta  stone  500  dollars <period> that  's  the  current  business  model <period> the  problem  with  this  business  model  is  that  95  percent  of  the  world  's  population  does  n't  have  500  dollars <period> so  it  's  extremely  unfair  towards  the  poor <period> this  is  totally  biased  towards  the  rich <period> now  see <comma> in  duolingo <comma> because  while  you  learn  you  're  actually  creating  value <comma> you  're  translating  stuff <comma> which  for  example <comma> we  could  charge  somebody  for  translations <period> so  this  is  how  we  could  monetize  this <period> since  people  are  creating  value  while  they  're  learning <comma> they  do  n't  have  to  pay  their  money <comma> they  pay  with  their  time <period> but  the  magical  thing  here  is  that  they  're  paying  with  their  time <comma> but  that  is  time  that  would  have  had  to  have  been  spent  anyways  learning  the  language <period> so  the  nice  thing  about  duolingo  is  i  think  it  provides  a  fair  business  model <comma> one  that  does  n't  discriminate  against  poor  people <period> so  here  's  the  site <period> thank  you <period> so  here  's  the  site <period> we  have  n't  yet  launched <comma> but  if  you  go  there <comma> you  can  sign  up  to  be  part  of  our  private  beta <comma> which  is  probably  going  to  start  in  about  three  or  four  weeks <period> we  have  n't  yet  launched  this  duolingo <period> by  the  way <comma> i  'm  the  one  talking  here <comma> but  actually  duolingo  is  the  work  of  a  really  awesome  team <comma> some  of  whom  are  here <period> so  thank  you <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  a  very  fundamental  change  that  is  going  on  in  the  very  fabric  of  the  modern  economy <period> and  to  talk  about  that <comma> i  'm  going  to  go  back  to  the  beginning <comma> because  in  the  beginning  were  commodities <period> commodities  are  things  that  you  grow  in  the  ground <comma> raise  on  the  ground  or  pull  out  of  the  ground <comma> basically <comma> animal <comma> mineral <comma> vegetable <period> and  then  you  extract  them  out  of  the  ground <comma> and  sell  them  on  the  open  marketplace <period> commodities  were  the  basis  of  the  agrarian  economy  that  lasted  for  millennia <period> but  then  along  came  the  industrial  revolution <comma> and  then  goods  became  the  predominant  economic  offering <comma> where  we  used  commodities  as  a  raw  material  to  be  able  to  make  or  manufacture  goods <period> so <comma> we  moved  from  an  agrarian  economy  to  an  industrial  economy <period> well <comma> what  then  happened  over  the  last  50  or  60  years <comma> is  that  goods  have  become  commoditized <period> commoditized <comma> where  they  're  treated  like  a  commodity <comma> where  people  do  n't  care  who  makes  them <period> they  just  care  about  three  things  and  three  things  only <comma> price <comma> price  and  price <period> now <comma> there  's  an  antidote  to  commoditization <comma> and  that  is  customization <period> my  first  book  was  called  mass  customization <comma> it  came  up  a  couple  of  times  yesterday <comma> and  how  i  discovered  this  progression  of  economic  value  was  realizing  that  customizing  a  good  automatically  turned  it  into  a  service <comma> because  it  was  done  just  for  a  particular  person <comma> because  it  was  n't  inventoried <comma> it  was  delivered  on  demand  to  that  individual  person <period> so <comma> we  moved  from  an  industrial  economy  to  a  service-based  economy <period> but  over  the  past  10  or  20  years <comma> what  's  happened  is  that  services  are  being  commoditized  as  well <period> long-distance  telephone  service  sold  on  price <comma> price <comma> price <period> fast-food  restaurants  with  all  their  value  pricing <period> and  even  the  internet  is  commoditizing  not  just  goods <comma> but  services  as  well <period> what  that  means  is  that  it  's  time  to  move  to  a  new  level  of  economic  value <period> time  to  go  beyond  the  goods  and  the  services <comma> and  use <comma> in  that  same  heuristic <comma> what  happens  when  you  customize  a  service <questionmark> what  happens  when  you  design  a  service  that  is  so  appropriate  for  a  particular  person <comma> that  's  exactly  what  they  need  at  this  moment  in  time <questionmark> then  you  cannot  help  but  make  them  go  wow <period> you  cannot  help  but  turn  it  into  a  memorable  event <comma> you  cannot  help  but  turn  it  into  an  experience <period> so  we  're  shifting  to  an  experience  economy <comma> where  experiences  are  becoming  the  predominant  economic  offering <period> now  most  places  that  i  talk  to <comma> when  i  talk  about  experience <comma> i  talk  about  disney <comma> the  world  's  premier  experience-stager <period> i  talk  about  theme  restaurants <comma> and  experiential  retail <comma> and  boutique  hotels <comma> and  las  vegas <comma> the  experience  capital  of  the  world <period> but  here <comma> when  you  think  about  experiences <comma> think  about  thomas  dolby  and  his  group <comma> playing  music <period> think  about  meaningful  places <period> think  about  drinking  wine <comma> about  a  journey  to  the  clock  of  the  long  now <period> those  are  all  experiences <period> think  about  ted  itself <period> the  experience  capital  in  the  world  of  conferences <period> all  of  these  are  experiences <period> now <comma> over  the  last  several  years  i  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  europe <comma> and  particularly  in  the  netherlands <comma> and  whenever  i  talk  about  the  experience  economy  there <comma> i  'm  always  greeted  at  the  end  with  one  particular  question <comma> almost  invariably <period> and  the  question  is  n't  really  so  much  a  question  as  an  accusation <period> and  the  dutch <comma> when  they  usually  put  it <comma> it  always  starts  with  the  same  two  words <period> you  know  the  words  i  mean <questionmark> you  americans <period> they  say <comma> you  americans <period> you  like  your  fantasy  environments <comma> your  fake <comma> your  disneyland  experiences <period> they  say <comma> we  dutch <comma> we  like  real <comma> natural <comma> authentic  experiences <period> so  much  has  that  happened  that  i've  developed  a  fairly  praticed  response <comma> which  is <comma> i  point  out  that  first  of  all <comma> you  have  to  understand  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  an  inauthentic  experience <period> why <questionmark> because  the  experience  happens  inside  of  us <period> it  's  our  reaction  to  the  events  that  are  staged  in  front  of  us <period> so <comma> as  long  as  we  are  in  any  sense  authentic  human  beings <comma> then  every  experience  we  have  is  authentic <period> now <comma> there  may  be  more  or  less  natural  or  artificial  stimuli  for  the  experience <comma> but  even  that  is  a  matter  of  degree <comma> not  kind <period> and  there  's  no  such  thing  as  a  100  percent  natural  experience <period> even  if  you  go  for  a  walk  in  the  proverbial  woods <comma> there  is  a  company  that  manufactured  the  car  that  delivered  you  to  the  edge  of  the  woods <period> there  's  a  company  that  manufactured  the  shoes  that  you  have  to  protect  yourself  from  the  ground  of  the  woods <period> there  's  a  company  that  provides  a  cell  phone  service  you  have  in  case  you  get  lost  in  the  woods <period> right <questionmark> all  of  those  are  man-made <comma> artificiality  brought  into  the  woods  by  you <comma> and  by  the  very  nature  of  being  there <period> and  then  i  always  finish  off  by  talking  about <comma> the  thing  that  amazes  me  the  most  about  this  question <comma> particularly  coming  from  the  dutch <comma> is  that  the  netherlands  is  every  bit  as  manufactured  as  disneyland <period> and  the  dutch <comma> they  always  go <period> and  they  realize <comma> i  'm  right <period> there  is  n't  a  square  meter  of  ground  in  the  entire  country  that  has  n't  been  reclaimed  from  the  sea <comma> or  otherwise  moved <comma> modified  and  manicured  to  look  as  if  it  had  always  been  there <period> it  's  the  only  place  you  ever  go  for  a  walk  in  the  woods  and  all  the  trees  are  lined  up  in  rows <period> but  nonetheless <comma> not  just  the  dutch <comma> but  everyone  has  this  desire  for  the  authentic <period> and  authenticity  is  therefore  becoming  the  new  consumer  sensibility <comma> the  buying  criteria  by  which  consumers  are  choosing  who  are  they  going  to  buy  from <comma> and  what  they  're  going  to  buy <period> becoming  the  basis  of  the  economy <period> in  fact <comma> you  can  look  at  how  each  of  these  economies  developed <comma> that  each  one  has  their  own  business  imperative <comma> matched  with  a  consumer  sensibility <period> we  're  the  agrarian  economy <comma> and  we  're  supplying  commodities <period> it  's  about  supply  and  availability <period> getting  the  commodities  to  market <period> with  the  industrial  economy <comma> it  is  about  controlling  costs <comma> getting  the  costs  down  as  low  as  possible  so  we  can  offer  them  to  the  masses <period> with  the  service  economy <comma> it  is  about  improving  quality <period> that  has <comma> the  whole  quality  movement  has  risen  with  the  service  economy  over  the  past  20  or  30  years <period> and  now <comma> with  the  experience  economy <comma> it  's  about  rendering  authenticity <period> rendering  authenticity <comma> and  the  keyword  is  rendering <period> right <questionmark> rendering <comma> because  you  have  to  get  your  consumers <comma> as  business  people <comma> to  percieve  your  offerings  as  authentic <period> because  there  is  a  basic  paradox <comma> no  one  can  have  an  inauthentic  experience <comma> but  no  business  can  supply  one <period> because  all  businesses  are  man-made  objects <period> all  business  is  involved  with  money <period> all  business  is  a  matter  of  using  machinery <comma> and  all  those  things  make  something  inauthentic <period> so <comma> how  do  you  render  authenticity <comma> is  the  question <period> are  you  rendering  authenticity <questionmark> when  you  think  about  that <comma> let  me  go  back  to  what  lionel  trilling <comma> in  his  seminal  book  on  authenticity <comma> sincerity  and  authenticity <comma> came  out  in  1960 <comma> points  to  as  the  seminal  point  at  which  authenticity  entered  the  lexicon <comma> if  you  will <period> and  that  is <comma> to  no  surprise <comma> in  shakespeare <comma> and  in  his  play <comma> hamlet <period> and  there  is  one  part  in  this  play <comma> hamlet <comma> where  the  most  fake  of  all  the  characters  in  hamlet <comma> polonius <comma> says  something  profoundly  real <period> at  the  end  of  a  laundry  list  of  advice  he  's  giving  to  his  son <comma> laertes <comma> he  says  this <comma> and  this  above  all <comma> to  thine  own  self  be  true <period> and  it  doth  follow <comma> as  night  the  day <comma> that  thou  canst  not  then  be  false  to  any  man <period> and  those  three  verses  are  the  core  of  authenticity <period> there  are  two  dimensions  to  authenticity <comma> one <comma> being  true  to  yourself <comma> which  is  very  self-directed <period> two <comma> is  other-directed <comma> being  what  you  say  you  are  to  others <period> and  i  do  n't  know  about  you <comma> but  whenever  i  encounter  two  dimensions <comma> i  immediately  go <comma> ahh <comma> two-by-two <period> all  right <questionmark> anybody  else  like  that <comma> no <questionmark> well <comma> if  you  think  about  that <comma> you  do <comma> in  fact <comma> get  a  two-by-two <period> where <comma> on  one  dimension  it  's  a  matter  of  being  true  to  yourself <period> as  businesses <comma> are  the  economic  offerings  you  are  providing <comma> are  they  true  to  themselves <questionmark> and  the  other  dimension  is <comma> are  they  what  they  say  they  are  to  others <questionmark> if  not <comma> you  have <comma> is  not  true  to  itself <comma> and  is  not  what  it  says  it  is <comma> yielding  a  two-by-two  matrix <period> and  of  course <comma> if  you  are  both  true  to  yourself <comma> and  are  what  you  say  you  are <comma> then  you  're  real  real <period> the  opposite <comma> of  course <comma> is <comma> fake  fake <period> all  right <comma> now <comma> there  is  value  for  fake <period> there  will  always  be  companies  around  to  supply  the  fake <comma> because  there  will  always  be  desire  for  the  fake <period> fact  is <comma> there  's  a  general  rule <comma> if  you  do  n't  like  it <comma> it  's  fake <period> if  you  do  like  it <comma> it  's  faux <period> now <comma> the  other  two  sides  of  the  coin  are <comma> being  a  real  fake <comma> is  what  it  says  it  is <comma> but  is  not  true  to  itself <comma> or  being  a  fake  real <comma> is  true  to  itself <comma> but  not  what  it  says  it  is <period> you  can  think  about  those  two <comma> you  know <comma> both  of  these  better  than  being  fake  fake <comma> not  quite  as  good  as  being  real  real <period> you  can  contrast  them  by  thinking  about  universal  city  walk  versus  disney  world <comma> or  disneyland <period> universal  city  walk  is  a  real  fake <comma> in  fact <comma> we  got  this  very  term  from  ada  louise  huxtable  's  book <comma> the  unreal  america  a  wonderful  book <comma> where  she  talks  about  universal  city  walk  as <comma> you  know <comma> she  decries  the  fake <comma> but  she  says <comma> at  least  that  's  a  real  fake <comma> right <comma> because  you  can  see  behind  the  facade <comma> right <questionmark> it  is  what  it  says  it  is <comma> it  's  universal  studio <period> it  's  in  the  city  of  los  angeles <period> you  're  going  to  walk  a  lot <period> right <questionmark> you  do  n't  tend  to  walk  a  lot  in  los  angeles <comma> well <comma> here  's  a  place  where  you  are  going  to  walk  a  lot <comma> outside  in  this  city <period> but  is  it  really  true  to  itself <questionmark> right <questionmark> is  it  really  in  the  city <questionmark> is  it <comma> you  can  see  behind  all  of  it <comma> and  see  what  is  going  on  in  the  facades  of  it <period> so  she  calls  it  a  real  fake <period> disney  world <comma> on  the  other  hand <comma> is  a  fake  real <comma> or  a  fake  reality <period> right <questionmark> it  's  not  what  it  says  it  is <period> it  's  not  really  the  magic  kingdom <period> but  it  is <comma> oh <comma> i  'm  sorry <comma> i  did  n't  mean  to <comma> sorry <period> we  wo  n't  talk  about  santa  claus  then <period> but  disney  world  is  wonderfully  true  to  itself <period> right <questionmark> just  wonderfully  true  to  itself <period> when  you  are  there  you  are  just  immersed  in  this  wonderful  environment <period> so <comma> it  's  a  fake  real <period> now  the  easiest  way  to  fall  down  in  this <comma> and  not  be  real  real <comma> right <comma> the  easiest  way  not  to  be  true  to  yourself  is  not  to  understand  your  heritage <comma> and  thereby  repudiate  that  heritage <period> right <comma> the  key  of  being  true  to  yourself  is  knowing  who  you  are  as  a  business <period> knowing  where  your  heritage  is <comma> what  you  have  done  in  the  past <period> and  what  you  have  done  in  the  past  limits  what  you  can  do <comma> what  you  can  get  away  with <comma> essentially <comma> in  the  future <period> so <comma> you  have  to  understand  that  past <period> think  about  disney  again <period> disney <comma> 10  or  15  years  ago <comma> right <comma> the  disney <comma> the  company  that  is  probably  best-known  for  family  values  out  there <comma> disney  bought  the  abc  network <period> the  abc  network <comma> affectionately  known  in  the  trade  as  the  t&ampa  network <comma> right <comma> that  's  not  too  much  jargon <comma> is  it <questionmark> right <comma> the  t&ampa  network <period> then  it  bought  miramax <comma> known  for  its  nc-17  fare <comma> and  all  of  a  sudden <comma> families  everywhere  could  n't  really  trust  what  they  were  getting  from  disney <period> it  was  no  longer  true  to  its  heritage <period> no  longer  true  to  walt  disney <period> that  's  one  of  the  reasons  why  they  're  having  such  trouble  today <comma> and  why  roy  disney  is  out  to  get  michael  eisner <period> because  it  is  no  longer  true  to  itself <period> so <comma> understand  what <comma> your  past  limits  what  you  can  do  in  the  future <period> when  it  comes  to  being  what  you  say  you  are <comma> the  easiest  mistake  that  companies  make  is  that  they  advertise  things  that  they  are  not <period> that  's  when  you  're  perceived  as  fake <comma> as  a  phony  company <comma> advertizing  things  that  you  're  not <period> think  about  any  hotel <comma> any  airline <comma> any  hospital <period> right <comma> if  you  could  check  into  the  ads <comma> you'd  have  a  great  experience <period> but  unfortunately <comma> you  have  to  experience  the  actual  hotel <comma> airline  and  hospital <comma> and  then  you  have  that  disconnect <period> then  you  have  that  perception  that  you  are  phony <period> so <comma> the  number  one  thing  to  do  when  it  comes  to  being  what  you  say  you  are <comma> is  to  provide  places  for  people  to  experience  who  you  are <period> for  people  to  experience  who  you  are <period> right <comma> it  's  not  advertising  does  it <period> that  's  why  you  have  companies  like  starbucks <comma> right <comma> that  does  n't  advertise  at  all <period> they  said <comma> you  want  to  know  who  we  are <comma> you  have  to  come  experience  us <period> and  think  about  the  economic  value  they  have  provided  by  that  experience <period> right <questionmark> coffee <comma> at  its  core <comma> is  what <questionmark> right <questionmark> it  's  beans <period> right <questionmark> it  's  coffee  beans <period> you  know  how  much  coffee  is  worth <comma> when  treated  as  a  commodity  as  a  bean <questionmark> two  or  three  cents  per  cup <comma> that  's  what  coffee  is  worth <period> but  grind  it <comma> roast  it <comma> package  it <comma> put  it  on  a  grocery  store  shelf <comma> and  now  it  'll  cost  five <comma> 10 <comma> 15  cents <comma> when  you  treat  it  as  a  good <period> take  that  same  good <comma> and  perform  the  service  of  actually  brewing  it  for  a  customer <comma> in  a  corner  diner <comma> in  a  bodega <comma> a  kiosk  somewhere <comma> you  get  50  cents <comma> maybe  a  buck  per  cup  of  coffee <period> but  surround  the  brewing  of  that  coffee  with  the  ambiance  of  a  starbucks <comma> with  the  authentic  cedar  that  goes  inside  of  there <comma> and  now <comma> because  of  that  authentic  experience <comma> you  can  charge  two <comma> three <comma> four <comma> five  dollars  for  a  cup  of  coffee <period> so <comma> authenticity  is  becoming  the  new  consumer  sensibility <period> let  me  summarize  it <comma> for  the  business  people  in  the  audience <comma> with  three  rules <comma> three  basic  rules <period> one <comma> do  n't  say  you  're  authentic  unless  you  really  are  authentic <period> two <comma> it  's  easier  to  be  authentic  if  you  do  n't  say  you  're  authentic <period> and  three <comma> if  you  say  you  're  authentic <comma> you  better  be  authentic <period> and  then  for  the  consumers <comma> for  everyone  else  in  the  audience <comma> let  me  simply  summarize  it  by  saying <comma> increasingly <comma> what  we <comma> what  will  make  us  happy <comma> is  spending  our  time  and  our  money  satisfying  the  desire  for  authenticity <period> thank  you <period> when  i  was  seven  years  old  and  my  sister  was  just  five  years  old <comma> we  were  playing  on  top  of  a  bunk  bed <period> i  was  two  years  older  than  my  sister  at  the  time <comma> i  mean <comma> i  'm  two  years  older  than  her  now <comma> but  at  the  time  it  meant  she  had  to  do  everything  that  i  wanted  to  do <comma> and  i  wanted  to  play  war <period> so  we  were  up  on  top  of  our  bunk  beds <period> and  on  one  side  of  the  bunk  bed <comma> i  had  put  out  all  of  my  gi <period> joe  soldiers  and  weaponry <period> and  on  the  other  side  were  all  my  sister  's  my  little  ponies  ready  for  a  cavalry  charge <period> there  are  differing  accounts  of  what  actually  happened  that  afternoon <comma> but  since  my  sister  is  not  here  with  us  today <comma> let  me  tell  you  the  true  story  -- <period> --  which  is  my  sister  's  a  little  bit  on  the  clumsy  side <period> somehow <comma> without  any  help  or  push  from  her  older  brother  at  all <comma> suddenly  amy  disappeared  off  of  the  top  of  the  bunk  bed  and  landed  with  this  crash  on  the  floor <period> now  i  nervously  peered  over  the  side  of  the  bed  to  see  what  had  befallen  my  fallen  sister  and  saw  that  she  had  landed  painfully  on  her  hands  and  knees  on  all  fours  on  the  ground <period> i  was  nervous  because  my  parents  had  charged  me  with  making  sure  that  my  sister  and  i  played  as  safely  and  as  quietly  as  possible <period> and  seeing  as  how  i  had  accidentally  broken  amy  's  arm  just  one  week  before <period> heroically  pushing  her  out  of  the  way  of  an  oncoming  imaginary  sniper  bullet <comma> for  which  i  have  yet  to  be  thanked <comma> i  was  trying  as  hard  as  i  could <comma> she  did  n't  even  see  it  coming <comma> i  was  trying  as  hard  as  i  could  to  be  on  my  best  behavior <period> and  i  saw  my  sister  's  face <comma> this  wail  of  pain  and  suffering  and  surprise  threatening  to  erupt  from  her  mouth  and  threatening  to  wake  my  parents  from  the  long  winter  's  nap  for  which  they  had  settled <period> so  i  did  the  only  thing  my  little  frantic  seven  year-old  brain  could  think  to  do  to  avert  this  tragedy <period> and  if  you  have  children <comma> you've  seen  this  hundreds  of  times  before <period> i  said <comma> amy <comma> amy <comma> wait <period> do  n't  cry <period> do  n't  cry <period> did  you  see  how  you  landed <questionmark> no  human  lands  on  all  fours  like  that <period> amy <comma> i  think  this  means  you  're  a  unicorn  now  that  was  cheating <comma> because  there  was  nothing  in  the  world  my  sister  would  want  more  than  not  to  be  amy  the  hurt  five  year-old  little  sister <comma> but  amy  the  special  unicorn <period> of  course <comma> this  was  an  option  that  was  open  to  her  brain  at  no  point  in  the  past <period> and  you  could  see  how  my  poor <comma> manipulated  sister  faced  conflict <comma> as  her  little  brain  attempted  to  devote  resources  to  feeling  the  pain  and  suffering  and  surprise  she  just  experienced <comma> or  contemplating  her  new-found  identity  as  a  unicorn <period> and  the  latter  won  out <period> instead  of  crying <comma> instead  of  ceasing  our  play <comma> instead  of  waking  my  parents <comma> with  all  the  negative  consequences  that  would  have  ensued  for  me <comma> instead  a  smile  spread  across  her  face  and  she  scrambled  right  back  up  onto  the  bunk  bed  with  all  the  grace  of  a  baby  unicorn <period> with  one  broken  leg <period> what  we  stumbled  across  at  this  tender  age  of  just  five  and  seven <comma> we  had  no  idea  at  the  time <comma> was  something  that  was  going  be  at  the  vanguard  of  a  scientific  revolution  occurring  two  decades  later  in  the  way  that  we  look  at  the  human  brain <period> what  we  had  stumbled  across  is  something  called  positive  psychology <comma> which  is  the  reason  that  i  'm  here  today  and  the  reason  that  i  wake  up  every  morning <period> when  i  first  started  talking  about  this  research  outside  of  academia <comma> out  with  companies  and  schools <comma> the  very  first  thing  they  said  to  never  do  is  to  start  your  talk  with  a  graph <period> the  very  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is  start  my  talk  with  a  graph <period> this  graph  looks  boring <comma> but  this  graph  is  the  reason  i  get  excited  and  wake  up  every  morning <period> and  this  graph  does  n't  even  mean  anything <period> it  's  fake  data <period> what  we  found  is <comma> if  i  got  this  data  back  studying  you  here  in  the  room <comma> i  would  be  thrilled <comma> because  there  's  very  clearly  a  trend  that  's  going  on  there <comma> and  that  means  that  i  can  get  published <comma> which  is  all  that  really  matters <period> the  fact  that  there  's  one  weird  red  dot  that  's  up  above  the  curve <comma> there  's  one  weirdo  in  the  room <comma> i  know  who  you  are <comma> i  saw  you  earlier <comma> that  's  no  problem <period> that  's  no  problem <comma> as  most  of  you  know <comma> because  i  can  just  delete  that  dot <period> i  can  delete  that  dot  because  that  's  clearly  a  measurement  error <period> and  we  know  that  's  a  measurement  error  because  it  's  messing  up  my  data <period> so  one  of  the  very  first  things  we  teach  people  in  economics  and  statistics  and  business  and  psychology  courses  is  how <comma> in  a  statistically  valid  way <comma> do  we  eliminate  the  weirdos <period> how  do  we  eliminate  the  outliers  so  we  can  find  the  line  of  best  fit <questionmark> which  is  fantastic  if  i  'm  trying  to  find  out  how  many  advil  the  average  person  should  be  taking <comma> two <period> but  if  i  'm  interested  in  potential <comma> if  i  'm  interested  in  your  potential <comma> or  for  happiness  or  productivity  or  energy  or  creativity <comma> what  we  're  doing  is  we  're  creating  the  cult  of  the  average  with  science <period> if  i  asked  a  question  like <comma> how  fast  can  a  child  learn  how  to  read  in  a  classroom  scientists  change  the  answer  to  how  fast  does  the  average  child  learn  how  to  read  in  that  classroom  and  then  we  tailor  the  class  right  towards  the  average <period> now  if  you  fall  below  the  average  on  this  curve <comma> then  psychologists  get  thrilled <comma> because  that  means  you  're  either  depressed  or  you  have  a  disorder <comma> or  hopefully  both <period> we  're  hoping  for  both  because  our  business  model  is <comma> if  you  come  into  a  therapy  session  with  one  problem <comma> we  want  to  make  sure  you  leave  knowing  you  have  10 <comma> so  you  keep  coming  back  over  and  over  again <period> we  'll  go  back  into  your  childhood  if  necessary <comma> but  eventually  what  we  want  to  do  is  make  you  normal  again <period> but  normal  is  merely  average <period> and  what  i  posit  and  what  positive  psychology  posits  is  that  if  we  study  what  is  merely  average <comma> we  will  remain  merely  average <period> then  instead  of  deleting  those  positive  outliers <comma> what  i  intentionally  do  is  come  into  a  population  like  this  one  and  say <comma> why <questionmark> why  is  it  that  some  of  you  are  so  high  above  the  curve  in  terms  of  your  intellectual  ability <comma> athletic  ability <comma> musical  ability <comma> creativity <comma> energy  levels <comma> your  resiliency  in  the  face  of  challenge <comma> your  sense  of  humor <questionmark> whatever  it  is <comma> instead  of  deleting  you <comma> what  i  want  to  do  is  study  you <period> because  maybe  we  can  glean  information <comma> not  just  how  to  move  people  up  to  the  average <comma> but  how  we  can  move  the  entire  average  up  in  our  companies  and  schools  worldwide <period> the  reason  this  graph  is  important  to  me  is <comma> when  i  turn  on  the  news <comma> it  seems  like  the  majority  of  the  information  is  not  positive <comma> in  fact  it  's  negative <period> most  of  it  's  about  murder <comma> corruption <comma> diseases <comma> natural  disasters <period> and  very  quickly <comma> my  brain  starts  to  think  that  's  the  accurate  ratio  of  negative  to  positive  in  the  world <period> what  that  's  doing  is  creating  something  called  the  medical  school  syndrome <comma> which <comma> if  you  know  people  who've  been  to  medical  school <comma> during  the  first  year  of  medical  training <comma> as  you  read  through  a  list  of  all  the  symptoms  and  diseases  that  could  happen <comma> suddenly  you  realize  you  have  all  of  them <period> i  have  a  brother  in-law  named  bobo <comma> which  is  a  whole  other  story <period> bobo  married  amy  the  unicorn <period> bobo  called  me  on  the  phone  from  yale  medical  school <comma> and  bobo  said <comma> shawn <comma> i  have  leprosy  which <comma> even  at  yale <comma> is  extraordinarily  rare <period> but  i  had  no  idea  how  to  console  poor  bobo  because  he  had  just  gotten  over  an  entire  week  of  menopause <period> see  what  we  're  finding  is  it  's  not  necessarily  the  reality  that  shapes  us <comma> but  the  lens  through  which  your  brain  views  the  world  that  shapes  your  reality <period> and  if  we  can  change  the  lens <comma> not  only  can  we  change  your  happiness <comma> we  can  change  every  single  educational  and  business  outcome  at  the  same  time <period> when  i  applied  to  harvard <comma> i  applied  on  a  dare <period> i  did  n't  expect  to  get  in <comma> and  my  family  had  no  money  for  college <period> when  i  got  a  military  scholarship  two  weeks  later <comma> they  allowed  me  to  go <period> suddenly <comma> something  that  was  n't  even  a  possibility  became  a  reality <period> when  i  went  there <comma> i  assumed  everyone  else  would  see  it  as  a  privilege  as  well <comma> that  they'd  be  excited  to  be  there <period> even  if  you  're  in  a  classroom  full  of  people  smarter  than  you <comma> you'd  be  happy  just  to  be  in  that  classroom <comma> which  is  what  i  felt <period> but  what  i  found  there  is <comma> while  some  people  experience  that <comma> when  i  graduated  after  my  four  years  and  then  spent  the  next  eight  years  living  in  the  dorms  with  the  students <comma> harvard  asked  me  to <period> i  was  n't  that  guy <period> i  was  an  officer  of  harvard  to  counsel  students  through  the  difficult  four  years <period> and  what  i  found  in  my  research  and  my  teaching  is  that  these  students <comma> no  matter  how  happy  they  were  with  their  original  success  of  getting  into  the  school <comma> two  weeks  later  their  brains  were  focused <comma> not  on  the  privilege  of  being  there <comma> nor  on  their  philosophy  or  their  physics <period> their  brain  was  focused  on  the  competition <comma> the  workload <comma> the  hassles <comma> the  stresses <comma> the  complaints <period> when  i  first  went  in  there <comma> i  walked  into  the  freshmen  dining  hall <comma> which  is  where  my  friends  from  waco <comma> texas <comma> which  is  where  i  grew  up <comma> i  know  some  of  you  have  heard  of  it <period> when  they'd  come  to  visit  me <comma> they'd  look  around <comma> they'd  say <comma> this  freshman  dining  hall  looks  like  something  out  of  hogwart  's  from  the  movie  harry  potter <comma> which  it  does <period> this  is  hogwart  's  from  the  movie  harry  potter  and  that  's  harvard <period> and  when  they  see  this <comma> they  say <comma> shawn <comma> why  do  you  waste  your  time  studying  happiness  at  harvard <questionmark> seriously <comma> what  does  a  harvard  student  possibly  have  to  be  unhappy  about  embedded  within  that  question  is  the  key  to  understanding  the  science  of  happiness <period> because  what  that  question  assumes  is  that  our  external  world  is  predictive  of  our  happiness  levels <comma> when  in  reality <comma> if  i  know  everything  about  your  external  world <comma> i  can  only  predict  10  percent  of  your  long-term  happiness <period> 90  percent  of  your  long-term  happiness  is  predicted  not  by  the  external  world <comma> but  by  the  way  your  brain  processes  the  world <period> and  if  we  change  it <comma> if  we  change  our  formula  for  happiness  and  success <comma> what  we  can  do  is  change  the  way  that  we  can  then  affect  reality <period> what  we  found  is  that  only  25  percent  of  job  successes  are  predicted  by  iq <period> 75  percent  of  job  successes  are  predicted  by  your  optimism  levels <comma> your  social  support  and  your  ability  to  see  stress  as  a  challenge  instead  of  as  a  threat <period> i  talked  to  a  boarding  school  up  in  new  england <comma> probably  the  most  prestigious  boarding  school <comma> and  they  said <comma> we  already  know  that <period> so  every  year <comma> instead  of  just  teaching  our  students <comma> we  also  have  a  wellness  week <period> and  we  're  so  excited <period> monday  night  we  have  the  world  's  leading  expert  coming  in  to  speak  about  adolescent  depression <period> tuesday  night  it  's  school  violence  and  bullying <period> wednesday  night  is  eating  disorders <period> thursday  night  is  elicit  drug  use <period> and  friday  night  we  're  trying  to  decide  between  risky  sex  or  happiness <period> i  said <comma> that  's  most  people  's  friday  nights  which  i  'm  glad  you  liked <comma> but  they  did  not  like  that  at  all <period> silence  on  the  phone <period> and  into  the  silence <comma> i  said <comma> i'd  be  happy  to  speak  at  your  school <comma> but  just  so  you  know <comma> that  's  not  a  wellness  week <comma> that  's  a  sickness  week <period> what  you've  done  is  you've  outlined  all  the  negative  things  that  can  happen <comma> but  not  talked  about  the  positive  the  absence  of  disease  is  not  health <period> here  's  how  we  get  to  health <comma> we  need  to  reverse  the  formula  for  happiness  and  success <period> in  the  last  three  years <comma> i've  traveled  to  45  different  countries <comma> working  with  schools  and  companies  in  the  midst  of  an  economic  downturn <period> and  what  i  found  is  that  most  companies  and  schools  follow  a  formula  for  success <comma> which  is  this <comma> if  i  work  harder <comma> i  'll  be  more  successful <period> and  if  i  'm  more  successful <comma> then  i  'll  be  happier <period> that  undergirds  most  of  our  parenting  styles <comma> our  managing  styles <comma> the  way  that  we  motivate  our  behavior <period> and  the  problem  is  it  's  scientifically  broken  and  backwards  for  two  reasons <period> first <comma> every  time  your  brain  has  a  success <comma> you  just  changed  the  goalpost  of  what  success  looked  like <period> you  got  good  grades <comma> now  you  have  to  get  better  grades <comma> you  got  into  a  good  school  and  after  you  get  into  a  better  school <comma> you  got  a  good  job <comma> now  you  have  to  get  a  better  job <comma> you  hit  your  sales  target <comma> we  're  going  to  change  your  sales  target <period> and  if  happiness  is  on  the  opposite  side  of  success <comma> your  brain  never  gets  there <period> what  we've  done  is  we've  pushed  happiness  over  the  cognitive  horizon  as  a  society <period> and  that  's  because  we  think  we  have  to  be  successful <comma> then  we  'll  be  happier <period> but  the  real  problem  is  our  brains  work  in  the  opposite  order <period> if  you  can  raise  somebody  's  level  of  positivity  in  the  present <comma> then  their  brain  experiences  what  we  now  call  a  happiness  advantage <comma> which  is  your  brain  at  positive  performs  significantly  better  than  it  does  at  negative <comma> neutral  or  stressed <period> your  intelligence  rises <comma> your  creativity  rises <comma> your  energy  levels  rise <period> in  fact <comma> what  we've  found  is  that  every  single  business  outcome  improves <period> your  brain  at  positive  is  31  percent  more  productive  than  your  brain  at  negative <comma> neutral  or  stressed <period> you  're  37  percent  better  at  sales <period> doctors  are  19  percent  faster <comma> more  accurate  at  coming  up  with  the  correct  diagnosis  when  positive  instead  of  negative <comma> neutral  or  stressed <period> which  means  we  can  reverse  the  formula <period> if  we  can  find  a  way  of  becoming  positive  in  the  present <comma> then  our  brains  work  even  more  successfully  as  we  're  able  to  work  harder <comma> faster  and  more  intelligently <period> what  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  is  to  reverse  this  formula  so  we  can  start  to  see  what  our  brains  are  actually  capable  of <period> because  dopamine <comma> which  floods  into  your  system  when  you  're  positive <comma> has  two  functions <period> not  only  does  it  make  you  happier <comma> it  turns  on  all  of  the  learning  centers  in  your  brain  allowing  you  to  adapt  to  the  world  in  a  different  way <period> we've  found  that  there  are  ways  that  you  can  train  your  brain  to  be  able  to  become  more  positive <period> in  just  a  two-minute  span  of  time  done  for  21  days  in  a  row <comma> we  can  actually  rewire  your  brain <comma> allowing  your  brain  to  actually  work  more  optimistically  and  more  successfully <period> we've  done  these  things  in  research  now  in  every  single  company  that  i've  worked  with <comma> getting  them  to  write  down  three  new  things  that  they  're  grateful  for  for  21  days  in  a  row <comma> three  new  things  each  day <period> and  at  the  end  of  that <comma> their  brain  starts  to  retain  a  pattern  of  scanning  the  world <comma> not  for  the  negative <comma> but  for  the  positive  first <period> journaling  about  one  positive  experience  you've  had  over  the  past  24  hours  allows  your  brain  to  relive  it <period> exercise  teaches  your  brain  that  your  behavior  matters <period> we  find  that  meditation  allows  your  brain  to  get  over  the  cultural  adhd  that  we've  been  creating  by  trying  to  do  multiple  tasks  at  once  and  allows  our  brains  to  focus  on  the  task  at  hand <period> and  finally <comma> random  acts  of  kindness  are  conscious  acts  of  kindness <period> we  get  people <comma> when  they  open  up  their  inbox <comma> to  write  one  positive  email  praising  or  thanking  somebody  in  their  social  support  network <period> and  by  doing  these  activities  and  by  training  your  brain  just  like  we  train  our  bodies <comma> what  we've  found  is  we  can  reverse  the  formula  for  happiness  and  success <comma> and  in  doing  so <comma> not  only  create  ripples  of  positivity <comma> but  create  a  real  revolution <period> thank  you  very  much <period> okay <period> strolling  along  in  central  park  everyone  's  out  today  the  daisies  and  dogwoods  are  all  in  bloom  oh <comma> what  a  glorious  day  for  picnics  and  frisbees  and  roller  skaters <comma> friends  and  lovers  and  lonely  sunbathers  everyone  's  out  in  merry  manhattan  in  january  i  brought  the  iced  tea <period> did  you  bring  the  bug  spray <questionmark> the  flies  are  the  size  of  your  head  next  to  the  palm  tree <comma> did  you  see  the  gators  looking  happy  and  well  fed <questionmark> everyone  's  out  in  merry  manhattan  in  january  everyone <period> my  preacher  said <comma> do  n't  you  worry  the  scientists  have  it  all  wrong  and  so <comma> who  cares  it  's  winter  here <questionmark> and  i  have  my  halter-top  on  i  have  my  halter-top  on  everyone  's  out  in  merry  manhattan  in  january <period> chris  anderson <comma> jill  sobule <period> mountain  biking  in  israel  is  something  that  i  do  with  great  passion  and  commitment <period> and  when  i  'm  on  my  bike <comma> i  feel  that  i  connect  with  the  profound  beauty  of  israel <comma> and  i  feel  that  i  'm  united  with  this  country  's  history  and  biblical  law <period> and  also <comma> for  me <comma> biking  is  a  matter  of  empowerment <period> when  i  reach  the  summit  of  a  steep  mountain  in  the  middle  of  nowhere <comma> i  feel  young <comma> invincible <comma> eternal <period> it  's  as  if  i  'm  connecting  with  some  legacy  or  with  some  energy  far  greater  than  myself <period> you  can  see  my  fellow  riders  at  the  end  of  the  picture <comma> looking  at  me  with  some  concern <period> and  here  is  another  picture  of  them <period> unfortunately <comma> i  cannot  show  their  faces <comma> neither  can  i  disclose  their  true  names <comma> and  that  's  because  my  fellow  riders  are  juvenile  inmates <comma> offenders  spending  time  in  a  correction  facility  about  20  minutes  ride  from  here  -- <period> well <comma> like  everything  in  israel <period> and  i've  been  riding  with  these  kids  once  a  week <comma> every  tuesday <comma> rain  or  shine <comma> for  the  last  four  years <period> and  by  now <comma> they've  become  a  very  big  part  of  my  life <period> this  story  began  four  years  ago <period> the  correction  facility  where  they  are  locked  up  happens  to  be  right  in  the  middle  of  one  of  my  usual  trips <comma> and  it  's  surrounded  by  barbed  wires  and  electric  gates  and  armed  guards <period> so  on  one  of  these  rides <comma> i  talked  my  way  into  the  compound  and  went  to  see  the  warden <period> i  told  the  warden  that  i  wanted  to  start  a  mountain  biking  club  in  this  place  and  that  basically  i  wanted  to  take  the  kids  from  here  to  there <period> and  i  told  him <comma> let  's  find  a  way  in  which  i  'll  be  able  to  take  out  10  kids  once  a  week  to  ride  with  in  the  summer  in  the  country <period> and  the  warden  was  quite  amused <comma> and  he  told  me  he  thought  that  i  was  a  nut <period> and  he  told  me <comma> this  place  is  a  correction  facility <period> these  guys  are  serious  offenders <period> they  are  supposed  to  be  locked  up <period> they  are  n't  supposed  to  be  out  at  large <period> and  yet <comma> we  began  to  talk  about  it <comma> and  one  thing  led  to  another <period> and  i  cannot  see  myself  going  into  a  state  prison  in  new  jersey  and  making  such  a  proposition <comma> but  this  being  israel <comma> the  warden  somehow  made  it  happen <period> and  so  two  months  later <comma> we  found  ourselves  at  large <comma> myself <comma> 10  juvenile  inmates  and  a  wonderful  fellow  named  russ <comma> who  became  a  very  good  friend  of  mine  and  my  partner  in  this  project <period> and  in  the  next  few  weeks <comma> i  had  the  tremendous  pleasure  of  introducing  these  kids  to  the  world  of  total  freedom <comma> a  world  consisting  of  magnificent  vistas  like  these <comma> everything  you  see  here  is  obviously  in  israel <comma> as  well  as  close  encounters  with  all  sorts  of  small  creatures  coming  in  all  sorts  of  sizes <comma> colors <comma> shapes <comma> forms  and  so  on <period> in  spite  of  all  this  splendor <comma> the  beginning  was  extremely  frustrating <period> every  small  obstacle <comma> every  slight  uphill <comma> would  cause  these  fellows  to  stop  in  their  tracks  and  give  up <period> so  we  had  a  lot  of  this  going  on <period> i  found  out  that  they  had  a  very  hard  time  dealing  with  frustration  and  difficulties <comma> not  because  they  were  physically  unfit <period> but  that  's  one  reason  why  they  ended  up  where  they  were <period> and  i  became  increasingly  more  and  more  agitated <comma> because  i  was  there  not  only  to  be  with  them <comma> but  also  to  ride  and  create  a  team <period> and  i  did  n't  know  what  to  do <period> now <comma> let  me  give  you  an  example <period> we  're  going  downhill  in  some  rocky  terrain <comma> and  the  front  tire  of  alex  gets  caught  in  one  of  these  crevasses  here <period> so  he  crashes  down <comma> and  he  gets  slightly  injured <comma> but  this  does  not  prevent  him  from  jumping  up  and  then  starting  to  jump  up  and  down  on  his  bike  and  curse  violently <period> then  he  throws  his  helmet  in  the  air <period> his  backpack  goes  ballistic  in  some  other  direction <period> and  then  he  runs  to  the  nearest  tree  and  starts  to  break  branches  and  throw  rocks  and  curse  like  i've  never  heard <period> and  i  'm  just  standing  there <comma> watching  this  scene  with  a  complete  disbelief <comma> not  knowing  what  to  do <period> i  'm  used  to  algorithms  and  data  structures  and  super  motivated  students <comma> and  nothing  in  my  background  prepared  me  to  deal  with  a  raging <comma> violent  adolescent  in  the  middle  of  nowhere <period> and  you  have  to  realize  that  these  incidents  did  not  happen  in  convenient  locations <period> they  happened  in  places  like  this <comma> in  the  judean  desert <comma> 20  kilometers  away  from  the  nearest  road <period> and  what  you  do  n't  see  in  this  picture  is  that  somewhere  between  these  riders  there <comma> there  's  a  teenager  sitting  on  a  rock <comma> saying <comma> i  'm  not  moving  from  here <period> forget  it <period> i've  had  it <period> well <comma> that  's  a  problem  because  one  way  or  another <comma> you  have  to  get  this  guy  moving  because  it  's  getting  dark  soon  and  dangerous <period> it  took  me  several  such  incidents  to  figure  out  what  i  was  supposed  to  do <period> at  the  beginning <comma> it  was  a  disaster <period> i  tried  harsh  words  and  threats  and  they  took  me  nowhere <period> that  's  what  they  had  all  their  lives <period> and  at  some  point  i  found  out <comma> when  a  kid  like  this  gets  into  a  fit <comma> the  best  thing  that  you  can  possibly  do  is  stay  as  close  as  possible  to  this  kid <comma> which  is  difficult <comma> because  what  you  really  want  to  do  is  go  away <period> but  that  's  what  he  had  all  his  life <comma> people  walking  away  from  him <period> so  what  you  have  to  do  is  stay  close  and  try  to  reach  in  and  pet  his  shoulder  or  give  him  a  piece  of  chocolate <period> so  i  would  say <comma> alex <comma> i  know  that  it  's  terribly  difficult <period> why  do  n't  you  rest  for  a  few  minutes  and  then  we  'll  go  on <period> go  away  you  maniac-psychopath <period> why  would  you  bring  us  to  this  goddamn  place <questionmark> and  i  would  say <comma> relax <comma> alex <period> here  's  a  piece  of  chocolate <period> and  alex  would  go <comma> arrrrggg  because  you  have  to  understand  that  on  these  rides  we  are  constantly  hungry <comma> and  after  the  rides  also <period> and  who  is  this  guy <comma> alex <comma> to  begin  with <questionmark> he  's  a  17-year-old <period> when  he  was  eight <comma> someone  put  him  on  a  boat  in  odessa  on  his  own <period> and  he  ended  up  in  south  tel  aviv  and  did  not  have  the  good  luck  to  be  picked  up  by  a  unclear <period> and  roamed  the  streets  and  became  a  prominent  gang  member <period> and  he  spent  the  last  10  years  of  his  life  in  two  places  only <comma> the  slums  and  the  state  prison <comma> where  he  spent  the  last  two  years  before  he  ended  up  sitting  on  this  rock  there <period> and  so  this  kid  was  probably  abused <comma> abandoned <comma> ignored <comma> betrayed  by  almost  every  adult  along  the  way <period> so <comma> for  such  a  kid <comma> when  an  adult  that  he  learns  to  respect  stays  close  to  him  and  does  n't  walk  away  from  him  in  any  situation <comma> irrespective  of  how  he  behaves <comma> it  's  a  tremendous  healing  experience <period> it  's  an  act  of  unconditional  acceptance <comma> something  that  he  never  had <period> i  want  to  say  a  few  words  about  vision <period> when  i  started  this  program  four  years  ago <comma> i  had  this  original  plan  of  creating  a  team  of  winning  underdogs <period> i  had  an  image  of  lance  armstrong  in  my  mind <period> and  it  took  me  exactly  two  months  of  complete  frustration  to  realize  that  this  vision  was  misplaced <comma> and  that  there  was  another  vision  supremely  more  important  and  more  readily  available <period> it  all  of  a  sudden  dawned  on  me <comma> in  this  project <comma> that  the  purpose  of  these  rides  should  actually  be  to  expose  the  kids  to  one  thing  only <comma> love <period> love  to  the  country <comma> to  the  uphill  and  the  downhill <comma> to  all  the  incredible  creatures  that  surround  us <comma> the  animals <comma> the  plants <comma> the  insects  -- <period> love  and  respect  to  other  fellow  members  in  your  team <comma> in  your  biking  team <comma> and  most  importantly <comma> love  and  respect  to  yourself <comma> which  is  something  that  they  badly  miss <period> together  with  the  kids <comma> i  also  went  through  a  remarkable  transformation <period> now <comma> i  come  from  a  cutthroat  world  of  science  and  high  technology <period> i  used  to  think  that  reason  and  logic  and  relentless  drive  were  the  only  ways  to  make  things  happen <period> and  before  i  worked  with  the  kids <comma> anything  that  i  did  with  them <comma> or  anything  that  i  did  with  myself <comma> was  supposed  to  be  perfect <comma> ideal <comma> optimal <comma> but  after  working  with  them  for  some  time <comma> i  discovered  the  great  virtues  of  empathy  and  flexibility  and  being  able  to  start  with  some  vision <comma> and  if  the  vision  does  n't  work <comma> well  nothing  happened <period> all  you  have  to  do  is  play  with  it <comma> change  it  a  little  bit <comma> and  come  up  with  something  that  does  help <comma> that  does  work <period> so  right  now <comma> i  feel  more  like  these  are  my  principles <comma> and  if  you  do  n't  like  them <comma> i  have  others <period> and  one  of  these  principles  is  focus <period> before  each  ride  we  sit  together  with  the  kids <comma> and  we  give  them  one  word  to  think  about  during  the  ride <period> you  have  to  focus  their  attention  on  something  because  so  many  things  happen <period> so  these  are  words  like  teamwork  or  endurance  or  even  complicated  concepts  like  resource  allocation  or  perspective <comma> a  word  that  they  do  n't  understand <period> you  know <comma> perspective  is  one  of  these  critically  important  life-coping  strategies  that  mountain  biking  can  really  teach  you <period> i  tell  kids  when  they  struggle  through  some  uphill  and  feel  like  they  cannot  take  it  anymore <comma> it  really  helps  to  ignore  the  immediate  obstacles  and  raise  your  head  and  look  around  and  see  how  the  vista  around  you  grows <period> it  literally  propels  you  upwards <period> that  's  what  perspective  is  all  about <period> or  you  can  also  look  back  in  time  and  realize  that  you've  already  conquered  steeper  mountains  before <period> and  that  's  how  they  develop  self-esteem <period> now <comma> let  me  give  you  an  example  of  how  it  works <period> you  stand  with  your  bike  at  the  beginning  of  february <period> it  's  very  cold <comma> and  you  're  standing  in  one  of  these  rainy  days <comma> and  it  's  drizzling  and  cold  and  chilly <comma> and  you  're  standing  in <comma> let  's  say <comma> yokneam <period> and  you  look  up  at  the  sky  through  a  hole  in  the  clouds  you  see  the  monastery  at  the  top  of  the  muhraka <comma> that  's  where  you  're  supposed  to  climb  now <comma> and  you  say <comma> there  's  no  way  that  i  could  possibly  get  there <period> and  yet <comma> two  hours  later  you  find  yourself  standing  on  the  roof  of  this  monastery <comma> smeared  with  mud <comma> blood  and  sweat <period> and  you  look  down  at  yokneam <period> everything  is  so  small  and  tiny <period> and  you  say <comma> hey <comma> alex <period> look  at  this  parking  lot  where  we  started <period> it  's  that  big <period> i  cannot  believe  that  i  did  it <period> and  that  's  the  point  when  you  start  loving  yourself <period> and  so  we  talked  about  these  special  words  that  we  teach  them <period> and  at  the  end  of  each  ride <comma> we  sit  together  and  share  moments  in  which  those  special  words  of  the  day  popped  up  and  made  a  difference <period> and  these  discussions  can  be  extremely  inspiring <period> in  one  of  them <comma> one  of  the  kids  once  said <comma> when  we  were  riding  on  this  ridge  overlooking  the  dead  sea <comma> and  he  's  talking  about  this  spot  here <comma> i  was  reminded  of  the  day  when  i  left  my  village  in  ethiopia  and  went  away  together  with  my  brother <period> we  walked  120  kilometers  until  we  reached  sudan <period> this  was  the  first  place  where  we  got  some  water  and  supplies <period> and  he  goes  on  saying <comma> and  everyone  looks  at  him  like  a  hero <comma> probably  for  the  first  time  in  his  life <period> and  he  says <comma> because  i  also  have  volunteers  riding  with  me <comma> adults <comma> who  are  sitting  there  listening  to  him  -- <period> and  he  says <comma> and  this  was  just  the  beginning  of  our  ordeal  until  we  ended  up  in  israel <period> and  only  now <comma> he  says <comma> i  'm  beginning  to  understand  where  i  am <comma> and  i  actually  like  it <period> now  i  remember <comma> when  he  said  it <comma> i  felt  goosebumps  on  my  body <comma> because  he  said  it  overlooking  the  moab  mountains  here  in  the  background <period> that  's  where  joshua  descended  and  crossed  the  jordan  and  led  the  people  of  israel  into  the  land  of  canaan  3,000  years  ago  in  this  final  leg  of  the  journey  from  africa <period> and  so <comma> perspective  and  context  and  history  play  key  roles  in  the  way  i  plan  my  rides  with  the  kids <period> we  visit  kibbutzim  that  were  established  by  holocaust  survivors <period> we  explore  ruins  of  palestinian  villages <comma> and  we  discuss  how  they  became  ruins <period> and  we  go  through  numerous  remnants  of  jewish  settlements <comma> nabatic  settlements <comma> canaanite  settlements <comma> three- <comma> four <comma> five-thousand  years  old <period> and  through  this  tapestry <comma> which  is  the  history  of  this  country <comma> the  kids  acquire  what  is  probably  the  most  important  value  in  education <comma> and  that  is  the  understanding  that  life  is  complex <comma> and  there  's  no  black  and  white <period> and  by  appreciating  complexity <comma> they  become  more  tolerant <comma> and  tolerance  leads  to  hope <period> i  ride  with  these  kids  once  a  week <comma> every  tuesday <period> here  's  a  picture  i  took  last  tuesday <comma> less  than  a  week  ago <comma> and  i  ride  with  them  tomorrow  also <period> in  every  one  of  these  rides  i  always  end  up  standing  in  one  of  these  incredible  locations <comma> taking  in  this  incredible  landscape  around  me <period> and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  i  'm  alive <comma> and  that  i  sense  every  fiber  in  my  aching  body <period> and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  15  years  ago  i  had  the  courage  to  resign  my  tenured  position  at  nyu  and  return  to  my  home  country  where  i  can  do  these  incredible  rides  with  this  group  of  troubled  kids  coming  from  ethiopia  and  morocco  and  russia <period> and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  every  week <comma> every  tuesday <comma> and  actually  every  friday  also <comma> i  can  once  again  celebrate  in  the  marrow  of  my  bones  the  very  essence  of  living  in  israel  on  the  edge <period> thank  you <period> i'd  like  to  apologize <comma> first  of  all <comma> to  all  of  you  because  i  have  no  form  of  powerpoint  presentation <period> so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is <comma> every  now  and  again <comma> i  will  make  this  gesture <comma> and  in  a  moment  of  powerpoint  democracy <comma> you  can  imagine  what  you'd  like  to  see <period> i  do  a  radio  show <period> the  radio  show  is  called  the  infinite  monkey  cage <period> it  's  about  science <comma> it  's  about  rationalism <period> so  therefore <comma> we  get  a  lot  of  complaints  every  single  week <comma> complaints  including  one  we  get  very  often <comma> which  is  to  say  the  very  title <comma> infinite  monkey  cage <comma> celebrates  the  idea  of  vivisection <period> we  have  made  it  quite  clear  to  these  people  that  an  infinite  monkey  cage  is  roomy <period> we  also  had  someone  else  who  said <comma> the  infinite  monkey  cage  idea  is  ridiculous <period> an  infinite  number  of  monkeys  could  never  write  the  works  of  shakespeare <period> we  know  this  because  they  did  an  experiment <period> yes <comma> they  gave  12  monkeys  a  typewriter  for  a  week <comma> and  after  a  week <comma> they  only  used  it  as  a  bathroom <period> so  the  main  element  though <comma> the  main  complaint  we  get <comma> and  one  that  i  find  most  worrying <comma> is  that  people  say <comma> oh <comma> why  do  you  insist  on  ruining  the  magic <questionmark> you  bring  in  science <comma> and  it  ruins  the  magic <period> now  i  'm  an  arts  graduate <period> i  love  myth  and  magic  and  existentialism  and  self-loathing <period> that  's  what  i  do <period> but  i  also  do  n't  understand  how  it  does  ruin  the  magic <period> all  of  the  magic <comma> i  think <comma> that  may  well  be  taken  away  by  science  is  then  replaced  by  something  as  wonderful <period> astrology <comma> for  instance <comma> like  many  rationalists <comma> i  'm  a  pisces <period> now  astrology <comma> we  remove  the  banal  idea  that  your  life  could  be  predicted <period> that  you  'll <comma> perhaps  today <comma> meet  a  lucky  man  who  's  wearing  a  hat <period> that  is  gone <period> but  if  we  want  to  look  at  the  sky  and  see  predictions <comma> we  still  can <period> we  can  see  predictions  of  galaxies  forming <comma> of  galaxies  colliding  into  each  other <comma> of  new  solar  systems <period> this  is  a  wonderful  thing <period> if  the  sun  could  one  day <comma> and  indeed  the  earth <comma> in  fact <comma> if  the  earth  could  read  its  own  astrological <comma> astronomical  chart <comma> one  day  it  would  say <comma> not  a  good  day  for  making  plans <period> you  'll  been  engulfed  by  a  red  giant <period> and  that  to  me  as  well <comma> that  if  you  think  i  'm  worried  about  losing  worlds <comma> well  many  worlds  theory <comma> one  of  the  most  beautiful <comma> fascinating <comma> sometimes  terrifying  ideas  from  the  quantum  interpretation <comma> is  a  wonderful  thing <period> that  every  person  here <comma> every  decision  that  you've  made  today <comma> every  decision  you've  made  in  your  life <comma> you've  not  really  made  that  decision <comma> but  in  fact <comma> every  single  permutation  of  those  decisions  is  made <comma> each  one  going  off  into  a  new  universe <period> that  is  a  wonderful  idea <period> if  you  ever  think  that  your  life  is  rubbish <comma> always  remember  there  's  another  you  that  's  made  much  worse  decisions  than  that <period> if  you  ever  think <comma> ah <comma> i  want  to  end  it  all <comma> do  n't  end  it  all <period> remember  that  in  the  majority  of  universes <comma> you  do  n't  even  exist  in  the  first  place <period> this  to  me <comma> in  its  own  strange  way <comma> is  very <comma> very  comforting <period> now  reincarnation <comma> that  's  another  thing  gone <comma> the  afterlife <period> but  it  's  not  gone <period> science  actually  says  we  will  live  forever <period> well <comma> there  is  one  proviso <period> we  wo  n't  actually  live  forever <period> you  wo  n't  live  forever <period> your  consciousness <comma> the  you-ness  of  you <comma> the  me-ness  of  me <comma> that  gets  this  one  go <period> but  every  single  thing  that  makes  us <comma> every  atom  in  us <comma> has  already  created  a  myriad  of  different  things  and  will  go  on  to  create  a  myriad  of  new  things <period> we  have  been  mountains  and  apples  and  pulsars  and  other  people  's  knees <period> who  knows <comma> maybe  one  of  your  atoms  was  once  napoleon  's  knee <period> that  is  a  good  thing <period> unlike  the  occupants  of  the  universe <comma> the  universe  itself  is  not  wasteful <period> we  are  all  totally  recyclable <period> and  when  we  die <comma> we  do  n't  even  have  to  be  placed  in  different  refuse  sacs <period> this  is  a  wonderful  thing <period> understanding <comma> to  me <comma> does  not  remove  the  wonder  and  the  joy <period> for  instance <comma> my  wife  could  turn  to  me  and  she  may  say <comma> why  do  you  love  me <questionmark> and  i  can  with  all  honesty  look  her  in  the  eye  and  say <comma> because  our  pheromones  matched  our  olfactory  receptors <period> though  i  'll  probably  also  say  something  about  her  hair  and  personality  as  well <period> and  that  is  a  wonderful  thing  there <period> love  does  not  die  because  of  that  thing <period> pain  does  n't  go  away  either <period> this  is  a  terrible  thing <comma> even  though  i  understand  pain <period> if  someone  punches  me <comma> and  because  of  my  personality <comma> this  is  recently  a  regular  occurrence <comma> i  understand  where  the  pain  comes  from <period> it  is  basically  momentum  to  energy  where  the  four-vector  is  constant <comma> that  's  what  it  is <period> but  at  no  point  can  i  react  and  go <comma> ha <period> is  that  the  best  momentum-to-energy  fourth  vector  constant  you've  got <questionmark> no <comma> i  just  spit  out  a  tooth <period> and  that  is  all  of  these  different  things <comma> the  love  for  my  child <period> i  have  a  son <period> his  name  is  archie <period> i  'm  very  lucky <comma> because  he  's  better  than  all  the  other  children <period> now  i  know  you  do  n't  think  that <period> you  may  well  have  your  own  children  and  think <comma> oh  no <comma> my  child  's  best <period> that  's  the  wonderful  thing  about  evolution <comma> the  predilection  to  believe  that  our  child  is  best <period> now  in  many  ways <comma> that  's  just  a  survival  thing <period> the  fact  we  see  here  is  the  vehicle  for  our  genes <comma> and  therefore  we  love  it <period> but  we  do  n't  notice  that  bit <period> we  just  unconditionally  love <period> that  is  a  wonderful  thing <period> though  i  should  say  that  my  son  is  best  and  is  better  than  your  children <period> i've  done  some  tests <period> and  all  of  these  things  to  me  give  such  joy  and  excitement  and  wonder <period> even  quantum  mechanics  can  give  you  an  excuse  for  bad  housework <comma> for  instance <period> perhaps  you've  been  at  home  for  a  week  on  your  own <period> you  house  is  in  a  terrible  state <period> your  partner  is  about  to  return <period> you  think <comma> what  should  i  do <questionmark> do  nothing <period> all  you  have  to  do  is <comma> when  she  walks  in <comma> using  a  quantum  interpretation <comma> say <comma> i  'm  so  sorry <period> i  stopped  observing  the  house  for  a  moment <comma> and  when  i  started  observing  again <comma> everything  had  happened <period> that  's  the  strong  anthropic  principle  of  vacuuming <period> for  me <comma> it  's  a  very <comma> very  important  thing <period> even  on  my  journey  up  here <comma> the  joy  that  i  have  on  my  journey  up  here  every  single  time <period> if  you  actually  think <comma> you  remove  the  myth  and  there  is  still  something  wonderful <period> i  'm  sitting  on  a  train <period> every  time  i  breathe  in <comma> i  'm  breathing  in  a  million-billion-billion  atoms  of  oxygen <period> i  'm  sitting  on  a  chair <period> even  though  i  know  the  chair  is  made  of  atoms  and  therefore  actually  in  many  ways  empty  space <comma> i  find  it  comfortable <period> i  look  out  the  window <comma> and  i  realize  that  every  single  time  we  stop  and  i  look  out  that  window <comma> framed  in  that  window <comma> wherever  we  are <comma> i  am  observing  more  life  than  there  is  in  the  rest  of  the  known  universe  beyond  the  planet  earth <period> if  you  go  to  the  safari  parks  on  saturn  or  jupiter <comma> you  will  be  disappointed <period> and  i  realize  i  'm  observing  this  with  the  brain <comma> the  human  brain <comma> the  most  complex  thing  in  the  known  universe <period> that <comma> to  me <comma> is  an  incredible  thing <period> and  do  you  know  what <comma> that  might  be  enough <period> steven  weinberg <comma> the  nobel  laureate <comma> once  said <comma> the  more  the  universe  seems  comprehensible <comma> the  more  it  seems  pointless <period> now  for  some  people <comma> that  seems  to  lead  to  an  idea  of  nihilism <period> but  for  me <comma> it  does  n't <period> that  is  a  wonderful  thing <period> i  'm  glad  the  universe  is  pointless <period> it  means  if  i  get  to  the  end  of  my  life <comma> the  universe  cannot  turn  to  me  and  go <comma> what  have  you  been  doing <comma> you  idiot <questionmark> that  's  not  the  point <period> i  can  make  my  own  purpose <period> you  can  make  your  own  purpose <period> we  have  the  individual  power  to  go <comma> this  is  what  i  want  to  do <period> and  in  a  pointless  universe <comma> that <comma> to  me <comma> is  a  wonderful  thing <period> i  have  chosen  to  make  silly  jokes  about  quantum  mechanics  and  the  copenhagen  interpretation <period> you <comma> i  imagine <comma> can  do  much  better  things  with  your  time <period> thank  you  very  much <period> goodbye <period> hello  everyone <period> and  so  the  two  of  us  are  here  to  give  you  an  example  of  creation <period> and  i  'm  going  to  be  folding  one  of  robert  lang  's  models <period> and  this  is  the  piece  of  paper  it  will  be  made  from <period> and  you  can  see  all  of  the  folds  that  are  needed  for  it <period> and  rufus  is  going  to  be  doing  some  improvisation  on  his  custom <comma> five-string  electric  cello <comma> and  it  's  very  exciting  to  listen  to  him <period> are  you  ready  to  go <questionmark> ok <period> just  to  make  it  a  little  bit  more  exciting <period> all  right <period> take  it  away <comma> rufus <period> all  right <period> there  you  go <period> my  name  is  ryan  lobo <comma> and  i've  been  involved  in  the  documentary  filmmaking  business  all  over  the  world  for  the  last  10  years <period> during  the  process  of  making  these  films  i  found  myself  taking  photographs <comma> often  much  to  the  annoyance  of  the  video  cameramen <period> i  found  this  photography  of  mine  almost  compulsive <period> and  at  the  end  of  a  shoot <comma> i  would  sometimes  feel  that  i  had  photographs  that  told  a  better  story  than  a  sometimes-sensational  documentary <period> i  felt <comma> when  i  had  my  photographs <comma> that  i  was  holding  on  to  something  true <comma> regardless  of  agendas  or  politics <period> in  2007 <comma> i  traveled  to  three  war  zones <period> i  traveled  to  iraq <comma> afghanistan  and  liberia <period> and  over  there  i  experienced  other  people  's  suffering <comma> up  close  and  personal <comma> immersed  myself  in  some  rather  intense  and  emotional  stories <comma> and  at  times  i  experienced  great  fear  for  my  own  life <period> as  always <comma> i  would  return  to  bangalore <comma> and  often  to  animated  discussions  at  friend  's  homes <comma> where  we  would  discuss  various  issues  while  they  complained  bitterly  about  the  new  pub  timings <comma> where  a  drink  often  cost  more  than  what  they'd  paid  their  14-year-old  maid <period> i  would  feel  very  isolated  during  these  discussions <period> but  at  the  same  time <comma> i  questioned  myself  and  my  own  integrity  and  purpose  in  storytelling <period> and  i  decided  that  i  had  compromised <comma> just  like  my  friends  in  those  discussions <comma> where  we  told  stories  in  contexts  we  made  excuses  for <comma> rather  than  taking  responsibility  for <period> i  wo  n't  go  into  details  about  what  led  to  a  decision  i  made <comma> but  let  's  just  say  it  involved  alcohol <comma> cigarettes <comma> other  substances  and  a  woman <period> i  basically  decided  that  it  was  i <comma> not  the  camera  or  the  network <comma> or  anything  that  lay  outside  myself <comma> that  was  the  only  instrument  in  storytelling  truly  worth  tuning <period> in  my  life <comma> when  i  tried  to  achieve  things  like  success  or  recognition <comma> they  eluded  me <period> paradoxically <comma> when  i  let  go  of  these  objectives <comma> and  worked  from  a  place  of  compassion  and  purpose <comma> looking  for  excellence <comma> rather  than  the  results  of  it <comma> everything  arrived  on  its  own <comma> including  fulfillment <period> photography  transcended  culture <comma> including  my  own <period> and  it  is <comma> for  me <comma> a  language  which  expressed  the  intangible <comma> and  gives  voice  to  people  and  stories  without <period> i  invite  you  into  three  recent  stories  of  mine <comma> which  are  about  this  way  of  looking <comma> if  you  will <comma> which  i  believe  exemplify  the  tenets  of  what  i  like  to  call  compassion  in  storytelling <period> in  2007  i  went  to  liberia <comma> where  a  group  of  my  friends  and  i  did  an  independent <comma> self-funded  film <comma> still  in  progress <comma> on  a  very  legendary  and  brutal  war-lord  named  general  butt  naked <period> his  real  name  is  joshua <comma> and  he  's  pictured  here  in  a  cell  where  he  once  used  to  torture  and  murder  people <comma> including  children <period> joshua  claims  to  have  personally  killed  more  than  10,000  people  during  liberia  's  civil  war <period> he  got  his  name  from  fighting  stark  naked <period> and  he  is  probably  the  most  prolific  mass  murderer  alive  on  earth  today <period> this  woman  witnessed  the  general  murdering  her  brother <period> joshua  commanded  his  child-soldiers  to  commit  unspeakable  crimes <comma> and  enforced  his  command  with  great  brutality <period> today  many  of  these  children  are  addicted  to  drugs  like  heroin <comma> and  they  are  destitute <comma> like  these  young  men  in  the  image <period> how  do  you  live  with  yourself  if  you  know  you've  committed  horrific  crimes <questionmark> today  the  general  is  a  baptized  christian  evangelist <period> and  he  's  on  a  mission <period> we  accompanied  joshua <comma> as  he  walked  the  earth <comma> visiting  villages  where  he  had  once  killed  and  raped <period> he  seeked  forgiveness <comma> and  he  claims  to  endeavor  to  improve  the  lives  of  his  child-soldiers <period> during  this  expedition  i  expected  him  to  be  killed  outright <comma> and  us  as  well <period> but  what  i  saw  opened  my  eyes  to  an  idea  of  forgiveness  which  i  never  thought  possible <period> in  the  midst  of  incredible  poverty  and  loss <comma> people  who  had  nothing  absolved  a  man  who  had  taken  everything  from  them <period> he  begs  for  forgiveness <comma> and  receives  it  from  the  same  woman  whose  brother  he  murdered <period> senegalese <comma> the  young  man  seated  on  the  wheelchair  here <comma> was  once  a  child  soldier <comma> under  the  general  's  command <comma> until  he  disobeyed  orders <comma> and  the  general  shot  off  both  his  legs <period> he  forgives  the  general  in  this  image <period> he  risked  his  life  as  he  walked  up  to  people  whose  families  he'd  murdered <period> in  this  photograph  a  hostile  crowd  in  a  slum  surrounds  him <period> and  joshua  remains  silent  as  they  vented  their  rage  against  him <period> this  image <comma> to  me <comma> is  almost  like  from  a  shakespearean  play <comma> with  a  man <comma> surrounded  by  various  influences <comma> desperate  to  hold  on  to  something  true  within  himself <comma> in  a  context  of  great  suffering  that  he  has  created  himself <period> i  was  intensely  moved  during  all  this <period> but  the  question  is <comma> does  forgiveness  and  redemption  replace  justice <questionmark> joshua <comma> in  his  own  words <comma> says  that  he  does  not  mind  standing  trial  for  his  crimes <comma> and  speaks  about  them  from  soapboxes  across  monrovia <comma> to  an  audience  that  often  includes  his  victims <period> a  very  unlikely  spokesperson  for  the  idea  of  separation  of  church  and  state <period> the  second  story  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about  is  about  a  group  of  very  special  fighting  women  with  rather  unique  peace-keeping  skills <period> liberia  has  been  devastated  by  one  of  africa  's  bloodiest  civil  wars <comma> which  has  left  more  than  200,000  people  dead <comma> thousands  of  women  scarred  by  rape  and  crime  on  a  spectacular  scale <period> liberia  is  now  home  to  an  all-woman  united  nations  contingent  of  indian  peacekeepers <period> these  women <comma> many  from  small  towns  in  india <comma> help  keep  the  peace <comma> far  away  from  home  and  family <period> they  use  negotiation  and  tolerance  more  often  than  an  armed  response <period> the  commander  told  me  that  a  woman  could  gauge  a  potentially  violent  situation  much  better  than  men <period> and  that  they  were  definitely  capable  of  diffusing  it  non-aggressively <period> this  man  was  very  drunk <comma> and  he  was  very  interested  in  my  camera <comma> until  he  noticed  the  women <comma> who  handled  him  with  smiles <comma> and  ak-47s  at  the  ready <comma> of  course <period> this  contingent  seems  to  be  quite  lucky <comma> and  it  has  not  sustained  any  casualties <comma> even  though  dozens  of  peacekeepers  have  been  killed  in  liberia <period> and  yes <comma> all  of  those  people  killed  were  male <period> many  of  the  women  are  married  with  children <comma> and  they  say  the  hardest  part  of  their  deployment  was  being  kept  away  from  their  children <period> i  accompanied  these  women  on  their  patrols <comma> and  watched  as  they  walked  past  men <comma> many  who  passed  very  lewd  comments  incessantly <period> and  when  i  asked  one  of  the  women  about  the  shock  and  awe  response <comma> she  said <comma> do  n't  worry <comma> same  thing  back  home <period> we  know  how  to  deal  with  these  fellows <period> and  ignored  them <period> in  a  country  ravaged  by  violence  against  women <comma> indian  peacekeepers  have  inspired  many  local  women  to  join  the  police  force <period> sometimes <comma> when  the  war  is  over  and  all  the  film  crews  have  left <comma> the  most  inspiring  stories  are  the  ones  that  float  just  beneath  the  radar <period> i  came  back  to  india  and  nobody  was  interested  in  buying  the  story <period> and  one  editor  told  me  that  she  was  n't  interested  in  doing  what  she  called  manual  labor  stories <period> in  2007  and  2009  i  did  stories  on  the  delhi  fire  service <comma> the  dfs <comma> which <comma> during  the  summer <comma> is  probably  the  world  's  most  active  fire  department <period> they  answer  more  than  5,000  calls  in  just  two  months <period> and  all  this  against  incredible  logistical  odds <comma> like  heat  and  traffic  jams <period> something  amazing  happened  during  this  shoot <period> due  to  a  traffic  jam <comma> we  were  late  in  getting  to  a  slum <comma> a  large  slum <comma> which  had  caught  fire <period> as  we  neared <comma> angry  crowds  attacked  our  trucks  and  stoned  them <comma> by  hundreds  of  people  all  over  the  place <period> these  men  were  terrified <comma> as  the  mob  attacked  our  vehicle <period> but  nonetheless <comma> despite  the  hostility <comma> firefighters  left  the  vehicle  and  successfully  fought  the  fire <period> running  the  gauntlet  through  hostile  crowds <comma> and  some  wearing  motorbike  helmets  to  prevent  injury <period> some  of  the  local  people  forcibly  took  away  the  hoses  from  the  firemen  to  put  out  the  fire  in  their  homes <period> now <comma> hundreds  of  homes  were  destroyed <period> but  the  question  that  lingered  in  my  mind  was <comma> what  causes  people  to  destroy  fire  trucks  headed  to  their  own  homes <questionmark> where  does  such  rage  come  from <questionmark> and  how  are  we  responsible  for  this <questionmark> 45  percent  of  the  14  million  people  who  live  in  delhi  live  in  unauthorized  slums <comma> which  are  chronically  overcrowded <period> they  lack  even  the  most  basic  amenities <period> and  this  is  something  that  is  common  to  all  our  big  cities <period> back  to  the  dfs <period> a  huge  chemical  depot  caught  fire <comma> thousands  of  drums  filled  with  petrochemicals  were  blazing  away  and  exploding  all  around  us <period> the  heat  was  so  intense <comma> that  hoses  were  used  to  cool  down  firefighters  fighting  extremely  close  to  the  fire <comma> and  with  no  protective  clothing <period> in  india  we  often  love  to  complain  about  our  government  bodies <period> but  over  here <comma> the  heads  of  the  dfs <comma> mr.  rc <period> sharman <comma> mr.  ak <period> sharman <comma> led  the  firefight  with  their  men <period> something  wonderful  in  a  country  where  manual  labor  is  often  looked  down  upon <period> over  the  years <comma> my  faith  in  the  power  of  storytelling  has  been  tested <period> and  i've  had  very  serious  doubt  about  its  efficacy <comma> and  my  own  faith  in  humanity <period> however <comma> a  film  we  shot  still  airs  on  the  national  geographic  channel <period> and  when  it  airs  i  get  calls  from  all  the  guys  i  was  with  and  they  tell  me  that  they  receive  hundreds  of  calls  congratulating  them <period> some  of  the  firemen  told  me  that  they  were  also  inspired  to  do  better  because  they  were  so  pleased  to  get  thank-yous  rather  than  brick  bats <period> it  seems  that  this  story  helped  change  perceptions  about  the  dfs <comma> at  least  in  the  minds  of  an  audience  in  part  on  televisions <comma> read  magazines  and  whose  huts  are  n't  on  fire <period> sometimes <comma> focusing  on  what  's  heroic <comma> beautiful  and  dignified <comma> regardless  of  the  context <comma> can  help  magnify  these  intangibles  three  ways <comma> in  the  protagonist  of  the  story <comma> in  the  audience <comma> and  also  in  the  storyteller <period> and  that  's  the  power  of  storytelling <period> focus  on  what  's  dignified <comma> courageous  and  beautiful <comma> and  it  grows <period> thank  you <period> /transcript <period> i'm  working  a  lot  with  motion  and  animation <comma> and  also  i  'm  an  old  dj  and  a  musician <period> so <comma> music  videos  are  something  that  i  always  found  interesting <comma> but  they  always  seem  to  be  so  reactive <period> so  i  was  thinking <comma> can  you  remove  us  as  creators  and  try  to  make  the  music  be  the  voice  and  have  the  animation  following  it <questionmark> so  with  two  designers <comma> tolga  and  christina <comma> at  my  office <comma> we  took  a  track <comma> many  of  you  probably  know  it <period> it's  about  25  years  old <comma> and  it  's  david  byrne  and  brian  eno <comma> and  we  did  this  little  animation <period> and  i  think  that  it  's  maybe  interesting <comma> also <comma> that  it  deals  with  two  problematic  issues <comma> which  are  rising  waters  and  religion <period> song <comma> before  god  destroyed  the  people  on  the  earth <comma> he  warned  noah  to  build  an  ark <period> and  after  noah  built  his  ark <comma> i  believe  he  told  noah  to  warn  the  people  that  they  must  change  all  their  wicked  ways  before  he  come  upon  them  and  destroy  them <period> and  when  noah  had  done  built  his  ark <comma> i  understand  that  somebody  began  to  rend  a  song <period> and  the  song  began  to  move  on  i  understand  like  this <period> and  when  noah  had  done  built  his  ark <period> move  on <period> in  fact <period> concern <period> so  they  get  tired <comma> has  come  dark  and  rain <period> they  get  weary  and  tired <period> and  then  he  went  and  knocked  an  old  lady  house <period> and  old  lady  ran  to  the  door  and  say <comma> who  is  it <questionmark> jack  say <comma> me <comma> mama-san <comma> could  we  spend  the  night  here <questionmark> because  we're  far  from  home <comma> we're  very  tired <period> and  the  old  lady  said <comma> oh  yes <comma> come  on  in <period> it  was  come  dark  and  rain <comma> will  make  you  weary  and  tired <period> it  's  a  great  pleasure  to  be  here <period> it  's  a  great  pleasure  to  speak  after  brian  cox  from  cern <period> i  think  cern  is  the  home  of  the  large  hadron  collider <period> what  ever  happened  to  the  small  hadron  collider <questionmark> where  is  the  small  hadron  collider <questionmark> because  the  small  hadron  collider  once  was  the  big  thing <period> now <comma> the  small  hadron  collider  is  in  a  cupboard <comma> overlooked  and  neglected <period> you  know  when  the  large  hadron  collider  started <comma> and  it  did  n't  work <comma> and  people  tried  to  work  out  why <comma> it  was  the  small  hadron  collider  team  who  sabotaged  it  because  they  were  so  jealous <period> the  whole  hadron  collider  family  needs  unlocking <period> the  lesson  of  brian  's  presentation <comma> in  a  way <comma> all  those  fantastic  pictures <comma> is  this  really <comma> that  vantage  point  determines  everything  that  you  see <period> what  brian  was  saying  was  science  has  opened  up  successively  different  vantage  points  from  which  we  can  see  ourselves <period> and  that  's  why  it  's  so  valuable <period> so  the  vantage  point  you  take  determines  virtually  everything  that  you  will  see <period> the  question  that  you  will  ask  will  determine  much  of  the  answer  that  you  get <period> and  so  if  you  ask  this  question <comma> where  would  you  look  to  see  the  future  of  education <questionmark> the  answer  that  we've  traditionally  given  to  that  is  very  straightforward <comma> at  least  in  the  last  20  years: <period> you  go  to  finland <period> finland  is  the  best  place  in  the  world  to  see  school  systems <period> the  finns  may  be  a  bit  boring  and  depressive  and  there  's  a  very  high  suicide  rate <comma> but  by  golly <comma> they  are  qualified <period> and  they  have  absolutely  amazing  education  systems <period> so  we  all  troop  off  to  finland <comma> and  we  wonder  at  the  social  democratic  miracle  of  finland  and  its  cultural  homogeneity  and  all  the  rest  of  it <comma> and  then  we  struggle  to  imagine  how  we  might  bring  lessons  back <period> well <comma> so <comma> for  this  last  year <comma> with  the  help  of  cisco  who  sponsored  me <comma> for  some  balmy  reason <comma> to  do  this <comma> i've  been  looking  somewhere  else <period> because  actually  radical  innovation  does  sometimes  come  from  the  very  best <comma> but  it  often  comes  from  places  where  you  have  huge  need <comma> unmet <comma> latent  demand <comma> and  not  enough  resources  for  traditional  solutions  to  work <comma> traditional <comma> high-cost  solutions <comma> which  depend  on  professionals <comma> which  is  what  schools  and  hospitals  are <period> so  i  ended  up  in  places  like  this <period> this  is  a  place  called  monkey  hill <period> it  's  one  of  the  hundreds  of  favelas  in  rio <period> most  of  the  population  growth  of  the  next  50  years  will  be  in  cities <period> we  'll  grow  by  six  cities  of  12  million  people  a  year  for  the  next  30  years <period> almost  all  of  that  growth  will  be  in  the  developed  world <period> almost  all  of  that  growth  will  be  in  places  like  monkey  hill <period> this  is  where  you  'll  find  the  fastest  growing  young  populations  of  the  world <period> so  if  you  want  recipes  to  work <comma> for  virtually  anything <comma> health <comma> education <comma> government  politics  and  education <comma> you  have  to  go  to  these  places <period> and  if  you  go  to  these  places <comma> you  meet  people  like  this <period> this  is  a  guy  called  juanderson <period> at  the  age  of  14 <comma> in  common  with  many  14-year-olds  in  the  brazilian  education  system <comma> he  dropped  out  of  school <period> it  was  boring <period> and  juanderson <comma> instead <comma> went  into  what  provided  kind  of  opportunity  and  hope  in  the  place  that  he  lived <comma> which  was  the  drugs  trade <period> and  by  the  age  of  16 <comma> with  rapid  promotion <comma> he  was  running  the  drugs  trade  in  10  favelas <period> he  was  turning  over  200,000  dollars  a  week <period> he  employed  200  people <period> he  was  going  to  be  dead  by  the  age  of  25 <period> and  luckily <comma> he  met  this  guy <comma> who  is  rodrigo  baggio <comma> the  owner  of  the  first  laptop  to  ever  appear  in  brazil <period> 1994 <comma> rodrigo  started  something  called  cdi <comma> which  took  computers  donated  by  corporations <comma> put  them  into  community  centers  in  favelas  and  created  places  like  this <period> what  turned  juanderson  around  was  technology  for  learning  that  made  learning  fun  and  accessible <period> or  you  can  go  to  places  like  this <period> this  is  kibera <comma> which  is  the  largest  slum  in  east  africa <period> millions  of  people  living  here <comma> stretched  over  many  kilometers <period> and  there  i  met  these  two <comma> azra  on  the  left <comma> maureen  on  the  right <period> they  just  finished  their  kenyan  certificate  of  secondary  education <period> that  name  should  tell  you  that  the  kenyan  education  system  borrows  almost  everything  from  britain <comma> circa  1950 <comma> but  has  managed  to  make  it  even  worse <period> so  there  are  schools  in  slums  like  this <period> they  're  places  like  this <period> that  's  where  maureen  went  to  school <period> they  're  private  schools <period> there  are  no  state  schools  in  slums <period> and  the  education  they  got  was  pitiful <period> it  was  in  places  like  this <period> this  a  school  set  up  by  some  nuns  in  another  slum  called  nakuru <period> half  the  children  in  this  classroom  have  no  parents  because  they've  died  through  aids <period> the  other  half  have  one  parent  because  the  other  parent  has  died  through  aids <period> so  the  challenges  of  education  in  this  kind  of  place  are  not  to  learn  the  kings  and  queens  of  kenya  or  britain <period> they  are  to  stay  alive <comma> to  earn  a  living <comma> to  not  become  hiv  positive <period> the  one  technology  that  spans  rich  and  poor  in  places  like  this  is  not  anything  to  do  with  industrial  technology <period> it  's  not  to  do  with  electricity  or  water <period> it  's  the  mobile  phone <period> if  you  want  to  design  from  scratch  virtually  any  service  in  africa <comma> you  would  start  now  with  the  mobile  phone <period> or  you  could  go  to  places  like  this <period> this  is  a  place  called  the  madangiri  settlement  colony <comma> which  is  a  very  developed  slum  about  25  minutes  outside  new  delhi <comma> where  i  met  these  characters  who  showed  me  around  for  the  day <period> the  remarkable  thing  about  these  girls <comma> and  the  sign  of  the  kind  of  social  revolution  sweeping  through  the  developing  world  is  that  these  girls  are  not  married <period> ten  years  ago <comma> they  certainly  would  have  been  married <period> now  they  're  not  married <comma> and  they  want  to  go  on  to  study  further <comma> to  have  a  career <period> they've  been  brought  up  by  mothers  who  are  illiterate <comma> who  have  never  ever  done  homework <period> all  across  the  developing  world  there  are  millions  of  parents <comma> tens <comma> hundreds  of  millions <comma> who  for  the  first  time  are  with  children  doing  homework  and  exams <period> and  the  reason  they  carry  on  studying  is  not  because  they  went  to  a  school  like  this <period> this  is  a  private  school <period> this  is  a  fee-pay  school <period> this  is  a  good  school <period> this  is  the  best  you  can  get  in  hyderabad  in  indian  education <period> the  reason  they  went  on  studying  was  this <period> this  is  a  computer  installed  in  the  entrance  to  their  slum  by  a  revolutionary  social  entrepreneur  called  sugata  mitra  who  has  conducted  the  most  radical  experiments <comma> showing  that  children <comma> in  the  right  conditions <comma> can  learn  on  their  own  with  the  help  of  computers <period> those  girls  have  never  touched  google <period> they  know  nothing  about  wikipedia <period> imagine  what  their  lives  would  be  like  if  you  could  get  that  to  them <period> so  if  you  look <comma> as  i  did <comma> through  this  tour <comma> and  by  looking  at  about  a  hundred  case  studies  of  different  social  entrepreneurs  working  in  these  very  extreme  conditions <comma> look  at  the  recipes  that  they  come  up  with  for  learning <comma> they  look  nothing  like  school <period> what  do  they  look  like <questionmark> well <comma> education  is  a  global  religion <period> and  education <comma> plus  technology <comma> is  a  great  source  of  hope <period> you  can  go  to  places  like  this <period> this  is  a  school  three  hours  outside  of  sao  paulo <period> most  of  the  children  there  have  parents  who  are  illiterate <period> many  of  them  do  n't  have  electricity  at  home <period> but  they  find  it  completely  obvious  to  use  computers <comma> websites <comma> make  videos <comma> so  on  and  so  forth <period> when  you  go  to  places  like  this  what  you  see  is  that  education  in  these  settings  works  by  pull <comma> not  push <period> most  of  our  education  system  is  push <period> i  was  literally  pushed  to  school <period> when  you  get  to  school <comma> things  are  pushed  at  you <comma> knowledge <comma> exams <comma> systems <comma> timetables <period> if  you  want  to  attract  people  like  juanderson  who  could <comma> for  instance <comma> buy  guns <comma> wear  jewelry <comma> ride  motorbikes  and  get  girls  through  the  drugs  trade <comma> and  you  want  to  attract  him  into  education <comma> having  a  compulsory  curriculum  does  n't  really  make  sense <period> that  is  n't  really  going  to  attract  him <period> you  need  to  pull  him <period> and  so  education  needs  to  work  by  pull <comma> not  push <period> and  so  the  idea  of  a  curriculum  is  completely  irrelevant  in  a  setting  like  this <period> you  need  to  start  education  from  things  that  make  a  difference  to  them  in  their  settings <period> what  does  that <questionmark> well <comma> the  key  is  motivation <comma> and  there  are  two  aspects  to  it <period> one  is  to  deliver  extrinsic  motivation <period> that  education  has  a  payoff <period> our  education  systems  all  work  on  the  principle  that  there  is  a  payoff <comma> but  you  have  to  wait  quite  a  long  time <period> that  's  too  long  if  you  're  poor <period> waiting  10  years  for  the  payoff  from  education  is  too  long  when  you  need  to  meet  daily  needs <comma> when  you've  got  siblings  to  look  after  or  a  business  to  help  with <period> so  you  need  education  to  be  relevant  and  help  people  to  make  a  living  there  and  then <comma> often <period> and  you  also  need  to  make  it  intrinsically  interesting <period> so  time  and  again <comma> i  found  people  like  this <period> this  is  an  amazing  guy <comma> sebastiao  rocha <comma> in  belo  horizonte <comma> in  the  third  largest  city  in  brazil <period> he  's  invented  more  than  200  games  to  teach  virtually  any  subject  under  the  sun <period> in  the  schools  and  communities  that  taio  works  in <comma> the  day  always  starts  in  a  circle  and  always  starts  from  a  question <period> imagine  an  education  system  that  started  from  questions <comma> not  from  knowledge  to  be  imparted <comma> or  started  from  a  game <comma> not  from  a  lesson <comma> or  started  from  the  premise  that  you  have  to  engage  people  first  before  you  can  possibly  teach  them <period> our  education  systems <comma> you  do  all  that  stuff  afterward <comma> if  you  're  lucky <comma> sport <comma> drama <comma> music <period> these  things <comma> they  teach  through <period> they  attract  people  to  learning  because  it  's  really  a  dance  project  or  a  circus  project  or <comma> the  best  example  of  all <comma> el  sistema  in  venezuela <comma> it  's  a  music  project <period> and  so  you  attract  people  through  that  into  learning <comma> not  adding  that  on  after  all  the  learning  has  been  done  and  you've  eaten  your  cognitive  greens <period> so  el  sistema  in  venezuela  uses  a  violin  as  a  technology  of  learning <period> taio  rocha  uses  making  soap  as  a  technology  of  learning <period> and  what  you  find  when  you  go  to  these  schemes  is  that  they  use  people  and  places  in  incredibly  creative  ways <period> masses  of  peer  learning <period> how  do  you  get  learning  to  people  when  there  are  no  teachers <comma> when  teachers  wo  n't  come <comma> when  you  cannot  afford  them <comma> and  even  if  you  do  get  teachers <comma> what  they  teach  is  n't  relevant  to  the  communities  that  they  serve <questionmark> well <comma> you  create  your  own  teachers <period> you  create  peer-to-peer  learning <comma> or  you  create  para-teachers <comma> or  you  bring  in  specialist  skills <period> but  you  find  ways  to  get  learning  that  's  relevant  to  people  through  technology <comma> people  and  places  that  are  different <period> so  this  is  a  school  in  a  bus  on  a  building  site  in  pune <comma> the  fastest  growing  city  in  asia <period> pune  has  5,000  building  sites <period> it  has  30,000  children  on  those  building  sites <period> that  's  one  city <period> imagine  that  urban  explosion  that  's  going  to  take  place  across  the  developing  world  and  how  many  thousands  of  children  will  spend  their  school  years  on  building  sites <period> well <comma> this  is  a  very  simple  scheme  to  get  the  learning  to  them  through  a  bus <period> and  they  all  treat  learning <comma> not  as  some  sort  of  academic <comma> analytical  activity <comma> but  as  that  's  something  that  's  productive <comma> something  you  make <comma> something  that  you  can  do <comma> perhaps  earn  a  living  from <period> so  i  met  this  character <comma> steven <period> he'd  spent  three  years  in  nairobi  living  on  the  streets  because  his  parents  had  died  of  aids <period> and  he  was  finally  brought  back  into  school <comma> not  by  the  offer  of  gcses <comma> but  by  the  offer  of  learning  how  to  become  a  carpenter <comma> a  practical  making  skill <period> so  the  trendiest  schools  in  the  world <comma> high  tech  high  and  others <comma> they  espouse  a  philosophy  of  learning  as  productive  activity <period> here <comma> there  is  n't  really  an  option <period> learning  has  to  be  productive  in  order  for  it  to  make  sense <period> and  finally <comma> they  have  a  different  model  of  scale <period> and  it  's  a  chinese  restaurant  model  of  how  to  scale <period> and  i  learned  it  from  this  guy <comma> who  is  an  amazing  character <period> he  's  probably  the  most  remarkable  social  entrepreneur  in  education  in  the  world <period> his  name  is  madhav  chavan <comma> and  he  created  something  called  pratham <period> and  pratham  runs  preschool  play  groups  for <comma> now <comma> 21  million  children  in  india <period> it  's  the  largest  ngo  in  education  in  the  world <period> and  it  also  supports  working-class  kids  going  into  indian  schools <period> he  's  a  complete  revolutionary <period> he  's  actually  a  trade  union  organizer  by  background <period> and  that  's  how  he  learned  the  skills  to  build  his  organization <period> when  they  got  to  a  certain  stage <comma> pratham  got  big  enough  to  attract  some  pro  bono  support  from  mckinsey <period> mckinsey  came  along  and  looked  at  his  model  and  said <comma> you  know  what  you  should  do  with  this <comma> madhav <questionmark> you  should  turn  it  into  mcdonald  's <period> and  what  you  do  when  you  go  to  any  new  site  is  you  kind  of  roll  out  a  franchise <period> and  it  's  the  same  wherever  you  go <period> it  's  reliable  and  people  know  exactly  where  they  are <period> and  there  will  be  no  mistakes <period> and  madhav  said <comma> why  do  we  have  to  do  it  that  way <questionmark> why  cannot  we  do  it  more  like  the  chinese  restaurants  there  are  chinese  restaurants  everywhere <comma> but  there  is  no  chinese  restaurant  chain <period> yet <comma> everyone  knows  what  is  a  chinese  restaurant <period> they  know  what  to  expect <comma> even  though  it  'll  be  subtly  different  and  the  colors  will  be  different  and  the  name  will  be  different <period> you  know  a  chinese  restaurant  when  you  see  it <period> these  people  work  with  the  chinese  restaurant  model  -- <period> same  principles <comma> different  applications  and  different  settings  -- <period> not  the  mcdonald  's  model <period> the  mcdonald  's  model  scales <period> the  chinese  restaurant  model  spreads <period> so  mass  education  started  with  social  entrepreneurship  in  the  19th  century <period> and  that  's  desperately  what  we  need  again  on  a  global  scale <period> and  what  can  we  learn  from  all  of  that <questionmark> well <comma> we  can  learn  a  lot  because  our  education  systems  are  failing  desperately  in  many  ways <period> they  fail  to  reach  the  people  they  most  need  to  serve <period> they  often  hit  their  target  but  miss  the  point <period> improvement  is  increasingly  difficult  to  organize <period> our  faith  in  these  systems <comma> incredibly  fraught <period> and  this  is  just  a  very  simple  way  of  understanding  what  kind  of  innovation <comma> what  kind  of  different  design  we  need <period> there  are  two  basic  types  of  innovation <period> there  's  sustaining  innovation <comma> which  will  sustain  an  existing  institution  or  an  organization <comma> and  disruptive  innovation  that  will  break  it  apart <comma> create  some  different  way  of  doing  it <period> there  are  formal  settings <comma> schools <comma> colleges <comma> hospitals <comma> in  which  innovation  can  take  place <comma> and  informal  settings <comma> communities <comma> families <comma> social  networks <period> almost  all  our  effort  goes  in  this  box <comma> sustaining  innovation  in  formal  settings <comma> getting  a  better  version  of  the  essentially  bismarckian  school  system  that  developed  in  the  19th  century <period> and  as  i  said <comma> the  trouble  with  this  is  that <comma> in  the  developing  world  there  just  are  n't  teachers  to  make  this  model  work <period> you'd  need  millions  and  millions  of  teachers  in  china <comma> india <comma> nigeria  and  the  rest  of  developing  world  to  meet  need <period> and  in  our  system <comma> we  know  that  simply  doing  more  of  this  wo  n't  eat  into  deep  educational  inequalities <comma> especially  in  inner  cities  and  former  industrial  areas <period> so  that  's  why  we  need  three  more  kinds  of  innovation <period> we  need  more  reinvention <period> and  all  around  the  world  now  you  see  more  and  more  schools  reinventing  themselves <period> they  're  recognizably  schools <comma> but  they  look  different <period> there  are  big  picture  schools  in  the  us <period> and  australia <period> there  are  kunskapsskolan  schools  in  sweden <period> of  14  of  them <comma> only  two  of  them  are  in  schools <period> most  of  them  are  in  other  buildings  not  designed  as  schools <period> there  is  an  amazing  school  in  northen  queensland  called  jaringan <period> and  they  all  have  the  same  kind  of  features <comma> highly  collaborative <comma> very  personalized <comma> often  pervasive  technology <period> learning  that  starts  from  questions  and  problems  and  projects <comma> not  from  knowledge  and  curriculum <period> so  we  certainly  need  more  of  that <period> but  because  so  many  of  the  issues  in  education  are  n't  just  in  school <comma> they  're  in  family  and  community <comma> what  you  also  need <comma> definitely <comma> is  more  on  the  right  hand  side <period> you  need  efforts  to  supplement  schools <period> the  most  famous  of  these  is  reggio  emilia  in  italy <comma> the  family-based  learning  system  to  support  and  encourage  people  in  schools <period> the  most  exciting  is  the  harlem  children  's  zone <comma> which  over  10  years <comma> led  by  geoffrey  canada <comma> has <comma> through  a  mixture  of  schooling  and  family  and  community  projects <comma> attempted  to  transform  not  just  education  in  schools <comma> but  the  entire  culture  and  aspiration  of  about  10,000  families  in  harlem <period> we  need  more  of  that  completely  new  and  radical  thinking <period> you  can  go  to  places  an  hour  away <comma> less <comma> from  this  room <comma> just  down  the  road <comma> which  need  that <comma> which  need  radicalism  of  a  kind  that  we  have  n't  imagined <period> and  finally <comma> you  need  transformational  innovation  that  could  imagine  getting  learning  to  people  in  completely  new  and  different  ways <period> so  we  are  on  the  verge <comma> 2015 <comma> of  an  amazing  achievement <comma> the  schoolification  of  the  world <period> every  child  up  to  the  age  of  15  who  wants  a  place  in  school  will  be  able  to  have  one  in  2015 <period> it  's  an  amazing  thing <period> but  it  is <comma> unlike  cars <comma> which  have  developed  so  rapidly  and  orderly <comma> actually  the  school  system  is  recognizably  an  inheritance  from  the  19th  century <comma> from  a  bismarkian  model  of  german  schooling  that  got  taken  up  by  english  reformers <comma> and  often  by  religious  missionaries <comma> taken  up  in  the  united  states  as  a  force  of  social  cohesion <comma> and  then  in  japan  and  south  korea  as  they  developed <period> it  's  recognizably  19th  century  in  its  roots <period> and  of  course  it  's  a  huge  achievement <period> and  of  course  it  will  bring  great  things <period> it  will  bring  skills  and  learning  and  reading <period> but  it  will  also  lay  waste  to  imagination <period> it  will  lay  waste  to  appetite <period> it  will  lay  waste  to  social  confidence <period> it  will  stratify  society  as  much  as  it  liberates  it <period> and  we  are  bequeathing  to  the  developing  world  school  systems  that  they  will  now  spend  a  century  trying  to  reform <period> that  is  why  we  need  really  radical  thinking <comma> and  why  radical  thinking  is  now  more  possible  and  more  needed  than  ever  in  how  we  learn <period> thank  you <period> does  anybody  know  when  the  stethoscope  was  invented <questionmark> any  guesses <questionmark> 1816 <period> and  what  i  can  say  is <comma> in  2016 <comma> doctors  are  n't  going  to  be  walking  around  with  stethoscopes <period> there  's  a  whole  lot  better  technology  coming <period> and  that  's  part  of  the  change  in  medicine <period> what  has  changed  our  society  has  been  wireless  devices <period> but  the  future  are  digital  medical  wireless  devices <comma> ok <questionmark> so <comma> let  me  give  you  some  examples  of  this  to  kind  of  make  this  much  more  concrete <period> this  is  the  first  one <period> this  is  an  electrocardiogram <period> and <comma> as  a  cardiologist <comma> to  think  that  you  could  see  in  real  time  a  patient <comma> an  individual <comma> anywhere  in  the  world  on  your  smartphone <comma> watching  your  rhythm <comma> that  's  incredible <period> and  it  's  with  us  today <period> but  that  's  just  the  beginning <period> you  check  your  email  while  you  're  sitting  here <period> in  the  future  you  're  going  to  be  checking  all  your  vital  signs <period> all  your  vital  signs <comma> your  heart  rhythm <period> your  blood  pressure <comma> your  oxygen <comma> your  temperature <comma> etc <period> this  is  already  available  today <period> this  is  airstrip  technologies <period> by  taking  the  aggregate  of  these  signals  in  the  hospital <comma> in  the  intensive  care  unit <comma> and  putting  it  on  a  smartphone  for  physicians <period> if  you  're  an  expectant  parent <comma> what  about  the  ability  to  monitor <comma> continuously <comma> fetal  heart  rate <comma> or  intrauterine  contractions <comma> and  not  having  to  worry  so  much  that  things  are  fine  as  the  pregnancy <comma> and  moving  over  into  the  time  of  delivery <questionmark> and  then  as  we  go  further <comma> today  we  have  continuous  glucose  sensors <period> right  now <comma> they  are  under  the  skin <period> but  in  the  future <comma> they  wo  n't  have  to  be  implanted <period> and  of  course <comma> the  desired  range <comma> trying  to  keep  glucose  between  75  and  less  than  200 <comma> checking  it  every  five  minutes  in  a  continuous  glucose  sensor  -- <period> you  'll  see  how  that  can  impact  diabetes <period> and  what  about  sleep <questionmark> we  're  going  to  zoom  in  on  that  a  little  bit <period> we  're  supposed  to  spend  a  third  of  our  life  in  sleep <period> what  if <comma> on  your  phone <comma> which  will  be  available  in  the  next  few  weeks <comma> you  had  every  minute  of  your  sleep  displayed <questionmark> and  this  is <comma> of  course <comma> as  you  can  see <comma> the  awake  is  the  orange <period> the  rem  sleep <comma> rapid  eye  movement <comma> dream  state <comma> is  in  light  green <period> and  light  is  gray <comma> light  sleep <period> and  deep  sleep <comma> the  best  restorative  sleep <comma> is  that  dark  green <period> how  about  counting  every  calorie <questionmark> and  this  is  ability <comma> in  real  time <comma> to  actually  take  measurements  of  caloric  intake  as  well  as  expenditure <comma> through  a  band-aid <period> now <comma> what  i've  talked  about  are  physiologic  metrics <period> but  what  i  want  to  get  to <comma> the  next  frontier <comma> very  quickly <comma> and  why  the  stethoscope  is  on  its  way  out <period> is  because  we  can  transcend  listening  to  the  valve  sounds <comma> and  the  breath  sounds <comma> because  now <period> introduced  by  ge <period> is  a  handheld  ultra-sound <period> why  is  this  important <questionmark> because  this  is  so  much  more  sensitive <period> here  is  an  example  of  an  abdominal  ultrasound <period> and  also  a  cardiac  echo <comma> which  can  be  sent  wireless <period> and  then  there  's  an  example  of  fetal  monitoring  on  your  smartphone <period> so <comma> we  're  not  just  talking  about  physiologic  metrics <comma> the  key  measurements  of  vital  signs <comma> and  all  those  things  in  physiology <comma> but  also  all  the  imaging  that  one  could  look  at  in  your  smartphone <period> now <comma> this  is  an  example  of  another  obsolete  technology <comma> soon  to  be  buried <comma> the  holter  monitor <period> twenty-four  hour  recording <comma> lots  of  wires <period> this  is  now  a  little  tiny  patch <period> you  can  put  it  on  for  two  weeks  and  send  it  in  the  mail <period> now <comma> how  does  this  work <questionmark> well <period> there  is  these  smart  band-aids  or  these  sensors  that  one  would  put  on <comma> on  a  shoe  or  on  the  wrist <period> and  this  sends  a  signal <period> and  it  creates  a  body  area  network  to  a  gateway <period> gateway  could  be  a  smartphone  or  it  could  be  a  dedicated  gateway <comma> as  today  many  of  these  things  are  dedicated  gateways <comma> because  they  are  not  so  well  integrated <period> that  signal  goes  to  the  web <comma> the  cloud <comma> and  then  it  can  be  processed  and  sent  anywhere <comma> to  a  caregiver <comma> to  a  physician <comma> back  to  the  patient <comma> etc <period> so <comma> that  's  basically  very  simplistic  technology  of  how  this  works <period> now <comma> i  have  this  device  on <period> i  did  n't  want  to  take  my  shirt  off  to  show  you <comma> but  i  can  tell  you  it  's  on <period> this  is  a  device  that  not  only  measures  cardiac  rhythm <comma> as  you  saw  already <comma> but  it  also  goes  well  beyond  that <period> this  is  me  now <period> and  you  can  see  the  ecg <period> below  that  's  the  actual  heart  rate  and  the  trend <period> to  the  right  of  that  is  a  bioconductant <period> that  's  the  fluid  status <period> fluid  status <comma> that  's  really  important  if  you  're  monitoring  somebody  with  heart  failure <period> and  below  that  's  temperature <comma> and  respiration <comma> and  oxygen <period> and  then  the  position  activity <period> so <comma> this  is  really  striking <comma> because  this  device  measures  seven  things  that  are  very  much  vital  signs  for  monitoring  someone  with  heart  failure <period> ok <questionmark> and  why  is  this  important <questionmark> well <period> this  is  the  most  expensive  bed <period> what  if  we  could  reduce  the  need  for  hospital  beds <questionmark> well <comma> we  can <period> first  of  all <comma> heart  failure  is  the  number  one  reason  for  hospital  admissions  and  readmissions  in  this  country <period> the  cost  of  heart  failure  is  37  billion  dollars  a  year <comma> which  is  80  percent  related  to  hospitalization <period> and  in  the  course  of  30  days  after  a  hospital  stay  for  a  medicare  greater  than  65  years  or  older <comma> is <comma> 27  percent  are  readmitted  in  30  days <period> and  by  six  months <comma> over  56  percent  are  readmitted <period> so <comma> can  we  improve  that <questionmark> well  the  idea  is  we  take  this  device  that  i  'm  wearing <comma> and  we  put  it  on  600  patients  with  heart  failure <comma> randomly  assigned <comma> versus  600  patients  who  do  n't  have  active  monitoring <period> and  see  whether  we  can  reduce  heart  failure  readmissions <period> and  that  's  exciting <period> and  we  'll  start  that  trial <comma> and  you  'll  hear  more  about  how  we  're  going  to  do  that <period> but  that  's  a  type  of  wireless  device  trial  that  could  change  medicine  in  the  years  ahead <period> why  now <questionmark> why  has  this  all  of  a  sudden  become  a  reality <comma> an  exciting  direction  in  the  future  of  medicine <questionmark> what  we  have  is <comma> in  a  way <comma> a  perfect  positive  storm <period> this  sets  up  consumer-driven  healthcare <period> that  's  where  this  is  all  starting <period> let  me  just  give  you  specifics  about  why  this  is  a  big  movement  if  you  're  not  aware  of  it: <period> 12  million  americans  have  gotten  a  nike  shoe <comma> which  is  a  body-area  network  that  connects  the  shoe <comma> the  sole  of  the  shoe  to  the  iphone <comma> or  an  ipod <period> and  this  wired  magazine  cover  article  really  captured  a  lot  of  this <period> it  talked  a  lot  about  the  nike  shoe  and  how  quickly  that  's  been  adopted  to  monitor  exercise  physiology  and  energy  expenditure <period> here  are  some  things <comma> the  principles  that  are  guiding  principles  to  keep  in  mind <comma> a  data-driven  health  revolution  promises  to  make  us  all  better <comma> faster <comma> and  stronger <period> living  by  numbers <period> this  was  from  july <comma> this  cover  article <comma> the  personal  metrics  movement  goes  way  beyond  diet  and  exercise <period> it  's  about  tracking  every  facet  of  life <comma> from  sleep  to  mood  to  pain <comma> 24/7/365 <period> well <comma> i  tried  this  device <period> a  lot  of  you  have  gotten  that  phillips  direct  life <period> but  i  got  the  fitbit <period> that  looks  like  this <period> it  's  like  a  wireless  accelerometer <comma> pedometer <period> and  i  want  to  just  give  you  the  results  of  that  testing <comma> because  i  wanted  to  understand  about  the  consumer  movement <period> i  hope  the <comma> by  the  way <comma> the  phillips  direct  life  works  better  -- <period> i  hope  so <period> but  this  monitors  food <comma> it  monitors  activity  and  tracks  weight <period> however  you  have  to  put  in  most  of  this  stuff <period> the  only  thing  it  really  tracks  by  itself  is  activity <period> and  even  then <comma> it  's  not  complete <period> so <comma> you  exercise  and  it  picks  up  the  exercise <period> you  put  in  your  height  and  weight <comma> it  calculates  bmi <period> and  of  course  it  tells  you  how  many  calories  you  're  expending  from  the  exercise <comma> and  how  many  you  took  in <comma> if  you  go  in  and  enter  all  the  foods <period> but  it  really  wants  you  to  enter  all  your  activity <period> and  so  i  went  to  this <comma> and  of  course  i  was  gratified  that  it  picked  up  the  42  minutes  of  exercise <comma> elliptical  exercise  i  did <period> but  then  it  wants  more  information <period> so <comma> it  says <comma> you  want  to  log  sexual  activity <period> how  long  did  you  do  it  for <questionmark> and  it  says <comma> how  hard  was  it <questionmark> furthermore  it  says <comma> start  time <period> now <comma> this  does  n't  appear <comma> this  just  does  n't  work <period> i  mean <comma> this  just  does  n't  work <period> so <comma> now  i  want  to  move  to  sleep <period> who  would  ever  have  thought  you  could  have  your  own  eeg  at  your  home <comma> tagged  to  a  very  nice  alarm  clock <comma> by  the  way <questionmark> this  is  the  headband  that  goes  with  this  alarm  clock <period> it  monitors  your  brainwaves  continuously <comma> when  you  're  sleeping <period> so <comma> i  did  this  thing  for  seven  days  getting  ready  for  tedmed <period> this  is  an  important  part  of  our  life <comma> one-third  you  're  supposed  to  be  sleeping <period> of  course  how  many  here  have  any  problems  with  sleeping <questionmark> it  's  usually  90  percent <period> so <comma> you  tell  me  you  sleep  better  than  expected <period> okay <comma> well  this  was  a  week  of  my  life  in  sleeping <period> and  you  get  a  zq <period> score <period> instead  of  an  iq <period> score <period> you  get  a  zq <period> score  when  you  wake  up <period> you  say <comma> oh <comma> ok  and  a  zq <period> score  is  adjusted  to  age <period> and  you  want  to  get  as  high  as  you  possibly  can <period> so  this  is  the  moment-by-moment <comma> or  minute-by-minute  sleep <period> and  you  see  that  zq <period> there  was  80-odd <period> and  the  wake  time  is  in  orange <period> and  this  can  be  a  problem <comma> as  i  learned <period> because  it  not  only  helps  you  with  quantifying  your  sleep <comma> but  also  tells  others  you  're  awake <period> so <comma> when  my  wife  came  in  and  she  could  tell  you  're  awake <period> eric <comma> i  want  to  talk <period> i  want  to  talk <period> and  i  'm  trying  to  play  possum <period> this  thing  is  very <comma> very  impressive <period> ok <period> so <comma> that  's  the  first  night <period> and  this  one  is  now  67 <period> and  that  's  not  a  good  score <period> and  this  tells  you <comma> of  course <comma> how  much  you  had  in  rem  sleep <comma> in  deep  sleep <comma> and  all  this  sort  of  thing <period> this  was  really  fascinating  because  this  gave  that  quantitation  about  all  the  different  phases  of  sleep <period> so <comma> it  also  then  tells  you  how  you  do  compared  to  your  age  group <period> it  's  like  a  managed  competition  of  sleep <period> and  really  interesting  stuff <period> look  at  this  thing  and  say <comma> well <comma> i  did  n't  think  i  was  a  very  good  sleeper <comma> but  actually  i  did  better  than  average  in  50  to  60  year  olds  ok <questionmark> and  the  key  thing  was <comma> what  i  did  n't  know <comma> was  that  i  was  a  really  good  dreamer <period> ok <period> now  let  's  move  from  sleep  to  diseases <period> eighty  percent  of  americans  have  chronic  disease <period> or  80  percent  of  age  greater  than  65  have  two  or  more  chronic  disease <period> 140  million  americans  have  one  or  more  chronic  disease <period> and  80  percent  of  our  15 <comma> whatever <comma> trillion  expenditures  are  related  to  chronic  disease <period> now <comma> diabetes  is  one  of  the  big  ones <period> almost  24  million  people  have  diabetes <period> and  here  is  the  latest  map <period> it  was  published  just  a  little  more  than  a  week  ago  in  the  new  york  times <period> and  it  is  n't  looking  good <period> that  is <comma> for  men <comma> 29  percent  in  the  country  over  60  have  type  ii  diabetes <period> and  women <comma> although  it  's  less <comma> it  's  terribly  high <period> but  of  course  we  have  a  way  to  measure  that  now  on  a  continuous  basis <comma> with  a  sensor  that  detects  blood  glucose <period> and  it  's  important  because  we  could  detect  hyperglycemia  that  otherwise  would  n't  be  known <comma> and  also  hypoglycemia <period> and  you  can  see  the  red  dots <comma> in  this  particular  patient  's  case <comma> were  finger  sticks <comma> which  would  have  missed  both  ends <period> but  by  continuous  monitoring <comma> it  captures  all  that  vital  information <period> the  future  of  this  though <comma> is  being  able  to  move  this  to  a  band-aid  type  phenomenon <period> and  that  's  not  so  far  away <period> so <comma> let  me  just  give  you <comma> very  quickly <comma> 10  top  targets  for  wireless  medicine <period> all  these  things  are  possible  -- <period> some  of  them  are  very  close <comma> or  already <comma> as  you  heard <comma> are  available  today <comma> in  some  way  or  form <period> alzheimer  's  disease <comma> there  's  five  million  people  affected <comma> and  you  can  check  vital  signs <comma> activity <comma> balance <period> asthma <comma> large  number <comma> we  could  detect  things  like  pollen  count <comma> air  quality <comma> respiratory  rate <period> breast  cancer <period> i  'll  show  you  an  example  of  that  real  quickly <period> chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease <period> depression <comma> there  's  a  great  approach  to  that  in  mood  disorders <period> diabetes  i've  just  mentioned <period> heart  failure  we  already  talked  about <period> hypertension <comma> 74  million  people  could  have  continuous  blood-pressure  monitoring  to  come  up  with  much  better  management  and  prevention <period> and  obesity  we  already  talked  about <comma> the  ways  to  get  to  that <period> and  sleep  disorders <period> this  is  effective  around  the  world <period> the  access  to  smartphones  and  cell  phones  today  is  extraordinary <period> and  this  article  from  the  economist  summed  it  up  beautifully  about  the  opportunities  in  health  across  the  developing  world: <period> mobile  phones  made  a  bigger  difference  to  the  lives  of  more  people <comma> more  quickly <comma> than  any  previous  technology <period> and  that  's  before  we  got  going  on  the  m-health  world <period> aging <comma> the  problem  is  enormous <period> 300,000  broken  hips  per  year <period> but  the  solutions  are  extraordinary <period> and  they  include  so  many  different  things <period> one  of  the  ones  i  just  wanted  to  mention <comma> the  ishoe  is  another  example  of  a  sensor  that  improves  proprioception  among  the  elderly  to  prevent  falling <period> one  of  many  different  techniques  using  wireless  sensors <period> so <comma> we  can  change  medicine  across  the  continuum  of  care <comma> across  the  ages  from  premies  or  unborn  children  to  seniors <period> the  pharmaceutical  arena  changes <period> the  full  spectrum  of  disease <comma> i  hope  i've  given  you  a  sense  of  that <comma> across  the  globe <period> there  are  two  things  that  can  really  accelerate  this  whole  process <period> one  of  them <comma> we  're  very  fortunate <comma> is  to  develop  a  dedicated  institute  and  that  's  work  that  started  with  the  work  that  scripps  with  qualcomm <period> and  then  the  great  fortune  of  meeting  up  with  gary  and  mary  west <comma> to  get  behind  this  wireless  health  institute <period> san  diego  is  an  extraordinary  place  for  this <period> there  's  over  650  wireless  companies <period> 100  of  which  or  more  are  working  in  wireless  health <period> it  's  the  number  one  source  of  commerce <comma> and  interestingly  it  dovetails  beautifully  with  over  500  life  science  companies <period> the  wireless  institute <comma> the  west  wireless  health  institute <comma> is  really  the  outgrowth  of  two  extraordinary  people  who  are  here  this  evening <comma> gary  and  mary  west <period> and  i'd  like  to  give  it  up  for  them  for  getting  behind  this <period> their  fantastic  philanthropic  investment  made  this  possible <period> and  this  is  really  a  nonprofit  education  center  which  is  just  about  to  open <period> it  looks  like  this <period> this  whole  building  dedicated <period> and  what  it  's  trying  to  do  is  accelerate  this  era <comma> to  take  unmet  medical  needs <comma> to  work  and  innovate  -- <period> and  we  just  appointed  the  chief  engineer <comma> mehran  mehregany <period> it  was  announced  on  monday  -- <period> then  to  move  up  with  development <comma> clinical  trial  validation  and  then  changing  medical  practice <comma> the  most  challenging  thing  of  all <comma> requiring  attention  to  reimbursement <comma> healthcare  policy <comma> healthcare  economics <period> the  other  big  thing <comma> besides  having  this  fantastic  institute  to  catalyze  this  process  is  guidance <period> and  that  's  of  course  relying  on  the  fact  that  medicine  goes  digital <period> if  we  understand  biology  from  genomics  and  omics  and  wireless  through  physiologic  phenotyping <comma> that  's  big <period> because  what  it  does  is  allow  a  convergence  like  we've  never  had  before <period> over  80  major  diseases  have  been  cracked  at  the  genomic  level <comma> but  this  is  quite  extraordinary <comma> more  has  been  learned  about  the  underpinnings  of  disease  in  the  last  two  and  a  half  years  than  in  the  history  of  man <period> and  when  you  put  that  together  with <comma> for  example <comma> now  an  app  for  the  iphone  with  your  genotype  to  guide  drug  therapy <period> but <comma> the  future <comma> we  can  now  tell  who  's  going  to  get  type  ii  diabetes  from  all  the  common  variants <comma> and  that  's  going  to  get  filled  in  more  with  low-frequency  variants  in  the  future <period> we  can  tell  who  's  going  to  get  breast  cancer  from  the  various  genes <period> we  can  also  know  who  's  likely  to  get  atrial  fibrillation <period> and  finally <comma> another  example <comma> sudden  cardiac  death <period> each  of  these  has  a  sensor <period> we  can  give  glucose  a  sensor  for  diabetes  to  prevent  it <period> we  can  prevent <comma> or  have  the  earliest  detection  possible <comma> for  breast  cancer  with  an  ultrasound  device  given  to  the  patient <period> an  ipatch <comma> irhythm <comma> for  atrial  fibrillation <period> and  vital-signs  monitoring  to  prevent  sudden  cardiac  death <period> we  lose  700,000  people  a  year  in  the  us <period> from  sudden  cardiac  death <period> so <comma> i  hope  i've  convinced  you  of  this <period> of  the  impact  on  hospital  clinic  resources  is  profound <period> and  then  the  impact  on  diseases  is  equally  impressive  across  all  these  different  diseases  and  more <period> it  's  really  taking  individualized  medicine  to  a  new  height  and  it  's  hyper-innovative <period> and  i  think  it  represents  the  black  swan  of  medicine <period> thanks  for  your  attention <period> i  got  a  visit  almost  exactly  a  year  ago <comma> a  little  over  a  year  ago <comma> from  a  very  senior  person  at  the  department  of  defense <period> came  to  see  me  and  said <comma> 1,600  of  the  kids  that  we've  sent  out  have  come  back  missing  at  least  one  full  arm <period> whole  arm <period> shoulder  disarticulation <period> and  we  're  doing  the  same  thing  we  did  for <comma> more  or  less <comma> that  we've  done  since  the  civil  war <comma> a  stick  and  a  hook <period> and  they  deserve  more  than  that <period> and  literally <comma> this  guy  sat  in  my  office  in  new  hampshire  and  said <comma> i  want  you  to  give  me  something  that  we  can  put  on  these  kids  that  'll  pick  up  a  raisin  or  a  grape  off  a  table <comma> they  'll  be  able  to  put  it  in  their  mouth  without  destroying  either  one <comma> and  they  'll  be  able  to  know  the  difference  without  looking  at  it <period> you  know <comma> had  efferent <comma> afferent <comma> and  haptic  response <period> he  finishes  explaining  that <comma> and  i  'm  waiting  for  the  big  300  pound  paper  proposal <period> and  he  said <comma> that  's  what  i  want  from  you <period> i  said <comma> look <comma> you  're  nuts <period> that  technology  's  just  not  available  right  now <period> and  it  cannot  be  done <period> not  in  an  envelope  of  a  human  arm <comma> with  21  degrees  of  freedom <comma> from  your  shoulder  to  your  fingertips <period> he  said <comma> about  two  dozen  of  these  1,600  kids  have  come  back  bilateral <period> you  think  it  's  bad  to  lose  one  arm <questionmark> that  's  an  inconvenience  compared  to  having  both  of  them  gone <period> i  got  a  day  job <comma> and  my  nights  and  weekends  are  already  filled  up  with  things  like <comma> let  's  supply  water  to  the  world <comma> and  power  to  the  world <comma> and  educate  all  the  kids <comma> which <comma> chris <comma> i  will  not  talk  about <period> i  do  n't  need  another  mission <period> i  keep  thinking  about  these  kids  with  no  arms <period> he  says  to  me <comma> we've  done  some  work  around  the  country <period> we've  got  some  pretty  amazing  neurology  and  other  people <period> i  said <comma> i  'll  take  a  field  trip <comma> i  'll  go  see  what  you  got <period> over  the  next  month  i  visited  lots  of  places <comma> some  out  here <comma> around  the  country <comma> found  the  best  of  the  best <period> i  went  down  to  washington <period> i  saw  these  guys <comma> and  said <comma> i  did  what  you  asked  me <period> i  looked  at  what  's  out  there <period> i  still  think  you  're  nuts <period> but  not  as  nuts  as  i  thought <period> i  put  a  team  together <comma> a  little  over  13  months  ago <comma> got  up  to  20  some-odd  people <period> we  said <comma> we  're  going  to  build  a  device  that  does  what  he  wants <period> we  have  14  out  of  the  21  degrees  of  freedom <period> you  do  n't  need  the  ones  in  the  last  two  fingers <period> we  put  this  thing  together <period> a  couple  of  weeks  ago  we  took  it  down  to  walter  reed <comma> which  is  unfortunately  more  in  the  news  these  days <period> we  showed  it  to  a  bunch  of  guys <period> one  guy  who  described  himself  as  being  lucky <comma> because  he  lost  his  left  arm <comma> and  he  's  a  righty <period> he  sat  at  a  table  with  seven  or  eight  of  these  other  guys <period> said  he  was  lucky <comma> because  he  had  his  good  arm <comma> and  then  he  pushed  himself  back  from  the  table <period> he  had  no  legs <period> these  kids  have  attitudes  that  you  just  cannot  believe <period> so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  now <comma> without  the  skin  on  it <comma> a  30-second  piece <comma> and  then  i  'm  done <period> but  understand  what  you  're  looking  at  we  made  small  enough  to  fit  on  a  50th  percentile  female <comma> so  that  we  could  put  it  in  any  of  these  people <period> it  's  going  to  go  inside  something  that  we  use  in  cat  scans  and  mris  of  whatever  is  their  good  arm <comma> to  make  silicon  rubber <comma> then  coat  it <comma> and  paint  it  in  3d <comma> exact  mirror  image  of  their  other  limb <period> so <comma> you  wo  n't  see  all  the  really  cool  stuff  that  's  in  this  series  elastic  set  of  14  actuators <comma> each  one  which  has  its  own  capability  to  sense  temperature  and  pressure <period> it  also  has  a  pneumatic  cuff  that  holds  it  on <comma> so  the  more  they  put  themselves  under  load <comma> the  more  it  attaches <period> they  take  the  load  off <comma> and  it  becomes <comma> again <comma> compliant <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  guy  doing  a  couple  of  simple  things  with  this  that  we  demonstrated  in  washington <period> can  we  look  at  this  thing <questionmark> watch  the  fingers  grab <period> the  thumb  comes  up <period> wrist <period> this  weighs  69  pounds <period> going  to  scratch  his  nose <period> it  's  got  14  active  degrees  of  freedom <period> now  he  's  going  to  pick  up  a  pen  with  his  opposed  thumb  and  index  finger <period> now  he  's  going  to  put  that  down <comma> pick  up  a  piece  of  paper <comma> rotate  all  the  degrees  of  freedom  in  his  hand  and  wrist <comma> and  read  it <period> i  want  to  talk  about  46  billion  years  of  history  in  18  minutes <period> that  's  300  million  years  per  minute <period> let  's  start  with  the  first  photograph  nasa  obtained  of  planet  mars <period> this  is  fly-by <comma> mariner  iv <period> it  was  taken  in  1965 <period> when  this  picture  appeared <comma> that  well-known  scientific  journal <comma> the  new  york  times <comma> wrote  in  its  editorial <comma> mars  is  uninteresting <period> it  's  a  dead  world <period> nasa  should  not  spend  any  time  or  effort  studying  mars  anymore <period> fortunately <comma> our  leaders  in  washington  at  nasa  headquarters  knew  better <period> and  we  began  a  very  extensive  study  of  the  red  planet <period> one  of  the  key  questions  in  all  of  science <comma> is  there  life  outside  of  earth <questionmark> i  believe  that  mars  is  the  most  likely  target  for  life  outside  the  earth <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  in  a  few  minutes  some  amazing  measurements  that  suggest  there  may  be  life  on  mars <period> but  let  me  start  with  a  viking  photograph <period> this  is  a  composite  taken  by  viking  in  1976 <period> viking  was  developed  and  managed  at  the  nasa  langley  research  center <period> we  sent  two  orbiters  and  two  landers  in  the  summer  of  1976 <period> we  had  four  spacecraft <comma> two  around  mars <comma> two  on  the  surface <comma> an  amazing  accomplishment <period> this  is  the  first  photograph  taken  from  the  surface  of  any  planet <period> this  is  a  viking  lander  photograph  of  the  surface  of  mars <period> and  yes <comma> the  red  planet  is  red <period> mars  is  half  the  size  of  the  earth <comma> but  because  two-thirds  of  the  earth  is  covered  by  water <comma> the  land  area  on  mars  is  comparable  to  the  land  area  on  earth <period> so <comma> mars  is  a  pretty  big  place  even  though  it  's  half  the  size <period> we  have  obtained  topographic  measurements  of  the  surface  of  mars <period> we  understand  the  elevation  differences <period> we  know  a  lot  about  mars <period> mars  has  the  largest  volcano  in  the  solar  system <comma> olympus  mons <period> mars  has  the  grand  canyon  of  the  solar  system <comma> valles  marineris <period> very <comma> very  interesting  planet <period> mars  has  the  largest  impact  crater  in  the  solar  system <comma> hellas  basin <period> this  is  2,000  miles  across <period> if  you  happened  to  be  on  mars  when  this  impactor  hit <comma> it  was  a  really  bad  day  on  mars <period> this  is  olympus  mons <period> this  is  bigger  than  the  state  of  arizona <period> volcanoes  are  important <comma> because  volcanoes  produce  atmospheres  and  they  produce  oceans <period> we  're  looking  at  valles  marineris <comma> the  largest  canyon  in  the  solar  system <comma> superimposed  on  a  map  of  the  united  states <comma> 3,000  miles  across <period> one  of  the  most  intriguing  features  about  mars <comma> the  national  academy  of  science  says  one  of  the  10  major  mysteries  of  the  space  age <comma> is  why  certain  areas  of  mars  are  so  highly  magnetized <period> we  call  this  crustal  magnetism <period> there  are  regions  on  mars <comma> where <comma> for  some  reason <comma> we  do  n't  understand  why  at  this  point <comma> the  surface  is  very <comma> very  highly  magnetized <period> is  there  water  on  mars <questionmark> the  answer  is  no <comma> there  is  no  liquid  water  on  the  surface  of  mars  today <period> but  there  is  intriguing  evidence  that  suggests  that  the  early  history  of  mars  there  may  have  been  rivers  and  fast  flowing  water <period> today  mars  is  very  very  dry <period> we  believe  there  's  some  water  in  the  polar  caps <period> there  are  polar  caps  of  north  pole  and  south  pole <period> here  are  some  recent  images <period> this  is  from  spirit  and  opportunity <period> these  images  that  show  at  one  time <comma> there  was  very  fast  flowing  water  on  the  surface  of  mars <period> why  is  water  important <questionmark> water  is  important  because  if  you  want  life  you  have  to  have  water <period> water  is  the  key  ingredient  in  the  evolution <comma> the  origin  of  life  on  a  planet <period> here  is  some  picture  of  antarctica  and  a  picture  of  olympus  mons <comma> very  similar  features <comma> glaciers <period> so <comma> this  is  frozen  water <period> this  is  ice  water  on  mars <period> this  is  my  favorite  picture <period> this  was  just  taken  a  few  weeks  ago <period> it  has  not  been  seen  publicly <period> this  is  european  space  agency <period> mars  express <comma> image  of  a  crater  on  mars  and  in  the  middle  of  the  crater  we  have  liquid  water <comma> we  have  ice <period> very  intriguing  photograph <period> we  now  believe  that  in  the  early  history  of  mars <comma> which  is  46  billion  years  ago <comma> 46  billion  years  ago <comma> mars  was  very  earth-like <period> mars  had  rivers <comma> mars  had  lakes <period> but  more  important  mars  had  planetary-scale  oceans <period> we  believe  that  the  oceans  were  in  the  northern  hemisphere <period> and  this  area  in  blue <comma> which  shows  a  depression  of  about  four  miles <comma> was  the  ancient  ocean  area  on  the  surface  of  mars <period> where  did  the  ocean  's  worth  of  water  on  mars  go <questionmark> well <comma> we  have  an  idea <period> this  is  a  measurement  we  obtained  a  few  years  ago  from  a  mars-orbiting  satellite  called  odyssey <period> sub-surface  water  on  mars <comma> frozen  in  the  form  of  ice <period> and  this  shows  the  percent <period> if  it  's  a  blueish  color <comma> it  means  16  percent  by  weight <period> sixteen  percent <comma> by  weight <comma> of  the  interior  contains  frozen  water <comma> or  ice <period> so <comma> there  is  a  lot  of  water  below  the  surface <period> the  most  intriguing  and  puzzling  measurement <comma> in  my  opinion <comma> we've  obtained  of  mars <comma> was  released  earlier  this  year  in  the  magazine  science <period> and  what  we  're  looking  at  is  the  presence  of  the  gas  methane <comma> ch4 <comma> in  the  atmosphere  of  mars <period> and  you  can  see  there  are  three  distinct  regions  of  methane <period> why  is  methane  important <questionmark> because  on  earth <comma> almost  all <comma> 999  percent <comma> of  the  methane  is  produced  by  living  systems <comma> not  little  green  men <comma> but  microscopic  life  below  the  surface  or  at  the  surface <period> we  now  have  evidence  that  methane  is  in  the  atmosphere  of  mars <comma> a  gas  that <comma> on  earth <comma> is  biogenic  in  origin <comma> produced  by  living  systems <period> these  are  the  three  plumes <comma> a <comma> b1 <comma> b2 <period> and  this  is  the  terrain  it  appears  over <period> and  we  know  from  geological  studies  that  these  regions  are  the  oldest  regions  on  mars <period> in  fact <comma> the  earth  and  mars  are  both  46  billion  years  old <period> the  oldest  rock  on  earth  is  only  36  billion <period> the  reason  there  is  a  billion-year  gap  in  our  geological  understanding  is  because  of  plate  tectonics <period> the  crust  of  the  earth  has  been  recycled <period> we  have  no  geological  record  prior  for  the  first  billion  years <period> that  record  exists  on  mars <period> and  this  terrain  that  we  're  looking  at  dates  back  to  46  billion  years  when  earth  and  mars  were  formed <period> it  was  a  tuesday <period> this  is  a  map  that  shows  where  we've  put  our  spacecraft  on  the  surface  of  mars <period> here  is  viking  i <comma> viking  ii <period> this  is  opportunity <period> this  is  spirit <period> this  is  mars  pathfinder <period> this  is  phoenix <comma> we  just  put  two  years  ago <period> notice  all  of  our  rovers  and  all  of  our  landers  have  gone  to  the  northern  hemisphere <period> that  's  because  the  northern  hemisphere  is  the  region  of  the  ancient  ocean  basin <period> there  are  n't  many  craters <period> and  that  's  because  the  water  protected  the  basin  from  being  impacted  by  asteroids  and  meteorites <period> but  look  in  the  southern  hemisphere <period> in  the  southern  hemisphere  there  are  impact  craters <comma> there  are  volcanic  craters <period> here  's  hellas  basin <comma> a  very  very  different  place <comma> geologically <period> look  where  the  methane  is <comma> the  methane  is  in  a  very  rough  terrain  area <period> what  is  the  best  way  to  unravel  the  mysteries  on  mars  that  exist <questionmark> we  asked  this  question  10  years  ago <period> we  invited  10  of  the  top  mars  scientists  to  the  langley  research  center  for  two  days <period> we  addressed  on  the  board  the  major  questions  that  have  not  been  answered <period> and  we  spent  two  days  deciding  how  to  best  answer  this  question <period> and  the  result  of  our  meeting  was  a  robotic  rocket-powered  airplane  we  call  ares <period> it  's  an  aerial  regional-scale  environmental  surveyor <period> there  's  a  model  of  ares  here <period> this  is  a  20-percent  scale  model <period> this  airplane  was  designed  at  the  langley  research  center <period> if  any  place  in  the  world  can  build  an  airplane  to  fly  on  mars <comma> it  's  the  langley  research  center <comma> for  almost  100  years  a  leading  center  of  aeronautics  in  the  world <period> we  fly  about  a  mile  above  the  surface <period> we  cover  hundreds  of  miles <comma> and  we  fly  about  450  miles  an  hour <period> we  can  do  things  that  rovers  cannot  do  and  landers  cannot  do: <period> we  can  fly  above  mountains <comma> volcanoes <comma> impact  craters <period> we  fly  over  valleys <period> we  can  fly  over  surface  magnetism <comma> the  polar  caps <comma> subsurface  water <period> and  we  can  search  for  life  on  mars <period> but <comma> of  equal  importance <comma> as  we  fly  through  the  atmosphere  of  mars <comma> we  transmit  that  journey <comma> the  first  flight  of  an  airplane  outside  of  the  earth <comma> we  transmit  those  images  back  to  earth <period> and  our  goal  is  to  inspire  the  american  public  who  is  paying  for  this  mission  through  tax  dollars <period> but  more  important  we  will  inspire  the  next  generation  of  scientists <comma> technologists <comma> engineers  and  mathematicians <period> and  that  's  a  critical  area  of  national  security  and  economic  vitality <comma> to  make  sure  we  produce  the  next  generation  of  scientists <comma> engineers <comma> mathematicians  and  technologists <period> this  is  what  ares  looks  like  as  it  flies  over  mars <period> we  preprogram  it <period> we  will  fly  where  the  methane  is <period> we  will  have  instruments  aboard  the  plane  that  will  sample <comma> every  three  minutes <comma> the  atmosphere  of  mars <period> we  will  look  for  methane  as  well  as  other  gasses  produced  by  living  systems <period> we  will  pinpoint  where  these  gases  emanate  from <comma> because  we  can  measure  the  gradient  where  it  comes  from <period> and  there <comma> we  can  direct  the  next  mission  to  land  right  in  that  area <period> how  do  we  transport  an  airplane  to  mars <questionmark> in  two  words <comma> very  carefully <period> the  problem  is  we  do  n't  fly  it  to  mars <period> we  put  it  in  a  spacecraft  and  we  send  it  to  mars <period> the  problem  is  the  spacecraft  's  largest  diameter  is  nine  feet <period> ares  is  21-foot  wingspan <comma> 17  feet  long <period> how  do  we  get  it  to  mars <questionmark> we  fold  it <comma> and  we  transport  it  in  a  spacecraft <period> and  we  have  it  in  something  called  an  aeroshell <period> this  is  how  we  do  it <period> and  we  have  a  little  video  that  describes  the  sequence <period> video <comma> seven <comma> six <period> green

<period> it  's  going  18  thousand  miles  an  hour <period> a  parachute  opens  up  to  slow  it  down <period> the  thermal  tiles  fall  off <period> the  airplane  is  exposed  to  the  atmosphere  for  the  first  time <period> it  unfolds <period> the  rocket  engine  begins <period> we  believe  that  in  a  one-hour  flight  we  can  rewrite  the  textbook  on  mars  by  making  high-resolution  measurements  of  the  atmosphere <comma> looking  for  gases  of  biogenic  origin <comma> looking  for  gases  of  volcanic  origin <period> studying  the  surface <comma> studying  the  magnetism  on  the  surface <comma> which  we  do  n't  understand <comma> as  well  as  about  a  dozen  other  areas <period> practice  makes  perfect <period> how  do  we  know  we  can  do  it <questionmark> because  we  have  tested  ares  model <comma> several  models  in  a  half  a  dozen  wind  tunnels  at  the  nasa  langley  research  center  for  eight  years <comma> under  mars  conditions <period> and <comma> of  equal  importance  is <comma> we  test  ares  in  the  earth  's  atmosphere <comma> at  100,000  feet <comma> which  is  comparable  to  the  density  and  pressure  of  the  atmosphere  on  mars  where  we  'll  fly <period> now <comma> 100,000  feet <comma> if  you  fly  cross-country  to  los  angeles <comma> you  fly  37,000  feet <period> we  do  our  tests  at  100,000  feet <period> and  i  want  to  show  you  one  of  our  tests <period> this  is  a  half-scale  model <period> this  is  a  high-altitude  helium  balloon <period> this  is  over  tilamook <comma> oregon <period> we  put  the  folded  airplane  on  the  balloon  -- <period> it  took  about  three  hours  to  get  up  there  -- <period> and  then  we  released  it  on  command  at  103,000  feet <period> and  we  deploy  the  airplane  and  everything  works  perfectly <period> and  we've  done  high-altitude  and  low-altitude  tests <comma> just  to  perfect  this  technique <period> we  're  ready  to  go <period> i  have  a  scale  model  here <period> but  we  have  a  full-scale  model  in  storage  at  the  nasa  langley  research  center <period> we  're  ready  to  go <period> all  we  need  is  a  check  from  nasa  headquarters  to  cover  the  costs <period> i  'm  prepared  to  donate  my  honorarium  for  today  's  talk  for  this  mission <period> there  's  actually  no  honorarium  for  anyone  for  this  thing <period> this  is  the  ares  team <period> we  have  about  150  scientists <comma> engineers <period> where  we  're  working  with  jet  propulsion  laboratory <comma> goddard  space  flight  center <comma> ames  research  center  and  half  a  dozen  major  universities  and  corporations  in  developing  this <period> it  's  a  large  effort <period> it  's  all  at  nasa  langley  research  center <period> and  let  me  conclude  by  saying  not  too  far  from  here <comma> right  down  the  road  in  kittyhawk <comma> north  carolina <comma> a  little  more  than  100  years  ago  history  was  made  when  we  had  the  first  powered  flight  of  an  airplane  on  earth <period> we  are  on  the  verge  right  now  to  make  the  first  flight  of  an  airplane  outside  the  earth  's  atmosphere <period> we  are  prepared  to  fly  this  on  mars <comma> rewrite  the  textbook  about  mars <period> if  you  're  interested  in  more  information <comma> we  have  a  website  that  describes  this  exciting  and  intriguing  mission <comma> and  why  we  want  to  do  it <period> thank  you  very  much <period> fifty  years  ago <comma> when  i  began  exploring  the  ocean <comma> no  one <comma> not  jacques  perrin <comma> not  jacques  cousteau  or  rachel  carson <comma> imagined  that  we  could  do  anything  to  harm  the  ocean  by  what  we  put  into  it  or  by  what  we  took  out  of  it <period> it  seemed <comma> at  that  time <comma> to  be  a  sea  of  eden <comma> but  now  we  know <comma> and  now  we  are  facing  paradise  lost <period> i  want  to  share  with  you  my  personal  view  of  changes  in  the  sea  that  affect  all  of  us <comma> and  to  consider  why  it  matters  that  in  50  years <comma> we've  lost <comma> actually <comma> we've  taken <comma> we've  eaten <comma> more  than  90  percent  of  the  big  fish  in  the  sea <period> why  you  should  care  that  nearly  half  of  the  coral  reefs  have  disappeared <period> why  a  mysterious  depletion  of  oxygen  in  large  areas  of  the  pacific  should  concern  not  only  the  creatures  that  are  dying <comma> but  it  really  should  concern  you <period> it  does  concern  you <comma> as  well <period> i  'm  haunted  by  the  thought  of  what  ray  anderson  calls  tomorrow  's  child <comma> asking  why  we  did  n't  do  something  on  our  watch  to  save  sharks  and  bluefin  tuna  and  squids  and  coral  reefs  and  the  living  ocean  while  there  still  was  time <period> well <comma> now  is  that  time <period> i  hope  for  your  help  to  explore  and  protect  the  wild  ocean  in  ways  that  will  restore  the  health  and <comma> in  so  doing <comma> secure  hope  for  humankind <period> health  to  the  ocean  means  health  for  us <period> and  i  hope  jill  tarter  's  wish  to  engage  earthlings  includes  dolphins  and  whales  and  other  sea  creatures  in  this  quest  to  find  intelligent  life  elsewhere  in  the  universe <period> and  i  hope <comma> jill <comma> that  someday  we  will  find  evidence  that  there  is  intelligent  life  among  humans  on  this  planet <period> did  i  say  that <questionmark> i  guess  i  did <period> for  me <comma> as  a  scientist <comma> it  all  began  in  1953  when  i  first  tried  scuba <period> it  's  when  i  first  got  to  know  fish  swimming  in  something  other  than  lemon  slices  and  butter <period> i  actually  love  diving  at  night <period> you  see  a  lot  of  fish  then  that  you  do  n't  see  in  the  daytime <period> diving  day  and  night  was  really  easy  for  me  in  1970 <comma> when  i  led  a  team  of  aquanauts  living  underwater  for  weeks  at  a  time <comma> at  the  same  time  that  astronauts  were  putting  their  footprints  on  the  moon <period> in  1979  i  had  a  chance  to  put  my  footprints  on  the  ocean  floor  while  using  this  personal  submersible  called  jim <period> it  was  six  miles  offshore  and  1,250  feet  down <period> it  's  one  of  my  favorite  bathing  suits <period> since  then <comma> i've  used  about  30  kinds  of  submarines  and  i've  started  three  companies  and  a  nonprofit  foundation  called  deep  search  to  design  and  build  systems  to  access  the  deep  sea <period> i  led  a  five-year  national  geographic  expedition <comma> the  sustainable  seas  expeditions <comma> using  these  little  subs <period> they  're  so  simple  to  drive  that  even  a  scientist  can  do  it <period> and  i  'm  living  proof <period> astronauts  and  aquanauts  alike  really  appreciate  the  importance  of  air <comma> food <comma> water <comma> temperature <comma> all  the  things  you  need  to  stay  alive  in  space  or  under  the  sea <period> i  heard  astronaut  joe  allen  explain  how  he  had  to  learn  everything  he  could  about  his  life  support  system  and  then  do  everything  he  could  to  take  care  of  his  life  support  system <period> and  then  he  pointed  to  this  and  he  said <comma> life  support  system <period> we  need  to  learn  everything  we  can  about  it  and  do  everything  we  can  to  take  care  of  it <period> the  poet  auden  said <comma> thousands  have  lived  without  love <period> none  without  water <period> ninety-seven  percent  of  earth  's  water  is  ocean <period> no  blue <comma> no  green <period> if  you  think  the  ocean  is  n't  important <comma> imagine  earth  without  it <period> mars  comes  to  mind <period> no  ocean <comma> no  life  support  system <period> i  gave  a  talk  not  so  long  ago  at  the  world  bank  and  i  showed  this  amazing  image  of  earth  and  i  said <comma> there  it  is <period> the  world  bank <period> that  's  where  all  the  assets  are <period> and  we've  been  trawling  them  down  much  faster  than  the  natural  systems  can  replenish  them <period> tim  worth  says  the  economy  is  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  environment <period> with  every  drop  of  water  you  drink <comma> every  breath  you  take <comma> you  're  connected  to  the  sea <period> no  matter  where  on  earth  you  live <period> most  of  the  oxygen  in  the  atmosphere  is  generated  by  the  sea <period> over  time <comma> most  of  the  planet  's  organic  carbon  has  been  absorbed  and  stored  there <comma> mostly  by  microbes <period> the  ocean  drives  climate  and  weather <comma> stabilizes  temperature <comma> shapes  earth  's  chemistry <period> water  from  the  sea  forms  clouds  that  return  to  the  land  and  the  seas  as  rain <comma> sleet  and  snow <comma> and  provides  home  for  about  97  percent  of  life  in  the  world <comma> maybe  in  the  universe <period> no  water <comma> no  life <period> no  blue <comma> no  green <period> yet  we  have  this  idea <comma> we  humans <comma> that  the  earth <comma> all  of  it <comma> the  oceans <comma> the  skies <comma> are  so  vast  and  so  resilient  it  does  n't  matter  what  we  do  to  it <period> that  may  have  been  true  10,000  years  ago <comma> and  maybe  even  1,000  years  ago  but  in  the  last  100 <comma> especially  in  the  last  50 <comma> we've  drawn  down  the  assets <comma> the  air <comma> the  water <comma> the  wildlife  that  make  our  lives  possible <period> new  technologies  are  helping  us  to  understand  the  nature  of  nature <period> the  nature  of  what  's  happening <period> showing  us  our  impact  on  the  earth <period> i  mean <comma> first  you  have  to  know  that  you've  got  a  problem <period> and  fortunately <comma> in  our  time <comma> we've  learned  more  about  the  problems  than  in  all  preceding  history <period> and  with  knowing  comes  caring <period> and  with  caring <comma> there  's  hope  that  we  can  find  an  enduring  place  for  ourselves  within  the  natural  systems  that  support  us <period> but  first  we  have  to  know <period> three  years  ago <comma> i  met  john  hanke <comma> who  's  the  head  of  google  earth <comma> and  i  told  him  how  much  i  loved  being  able  to  hold  the  world  in  my  hands  and  go  exploring  vicariously <period> but  i  asked  him <comma> when  are  you  going  to  finish  it <questionmark> you  did  a  great  job  with  the  land <comma> the  dirt <period> what  about  the  water <questionmark> since  then <comma> i've  had  the  great  pleasure  of  working  with  the  googlers <comma> with  doer  marine <comma> with  national  geographic <comma> with  dozens  of  the  best  institutions  and  scientists  around  the  world <comma> ones  that  we  could  enlist <comma> to  put  the  ocean  in  google  earth <period> and  as  of  just  this  week <comma> last  monday <comma> google  earth  is  now  whole <period> consider  this <comma> starting  right  here  at  the  convention  center <comma> we  can  find  the  nearby  aquarium <comma> we  can  look  at  where  we  're  sitting <comma> and  then  we  can  cruise  up  the  coast  to  the  big  aquarium <comma> the  ocean <comma> and  california  's  four  national  marine  sanctuaries <comma> and  the  new  network  of  state  marine  reserves  that  are  beginning  to  protect  and  restore  some  of  the  assets <period> we  can  flit  over  to  hawaii  and  see  the  real  hawaiian  islands: <period> not  just  the  little  bit  that  pokes  through  the  surface <comma> but  also  what  's  below <period> to  see <comma> wait  a  minute <comma> we  can  go  kshhplash <comma> right  there <comma> ha <comma> under  the  ocean <comma> see  what  the  whales  see <period> we  can  go  explore  the  other  side  of  the  hawaiian  islands <period> we  can  go  actually  and  swim  around  on  google  earth  and  visit  with  humpback  whales <period> these  are  the  gentle  giants  that  i've  had  the  pleasure  of  meeting  face  to  face  many  times  underwater <period> there  's  nothing  quite  like  being  personally  inspected  by  a  whale <period> we  can  pick  up  and  fly  to  the  deepest  place <comma> seven  miles  down <comma> the  mariana  trench <comma> where  only  two  people  have  ever  been <period> imagine  that <period> it  's  only  seven  miles <comma> but  only  two  people  have  been  there <comma> 49  years  ago <period> one-way  trips  are  easy <period> we  need  new  deep-diving  submarines <period> how  about  some  x  prizes  for  ocean  exploration <questionmark> we  need  to  see  deep  trenches <comma> the  undersea  mountains <comma> and  understand  life  in  the  deep  sea <period> we  can  now  go  to  the  arctic <period> just  ten  years  ago  i  stood  on  the  ice  at  the  north  pole <period> an  ice-free  arctic  ocean  may  happen  in  this  century <period> that  's  bad  news  for  the  polar  bears <period> that  's  bad  news  for  us  too <period> excess  carbon  dioxide  is  not  only  driving  global  warming <comma> it  's  also  changing  ocean  chemistry <comma> making  the  sea  more  acidic <period> that  's  bad  news  for  coral  reefs  and  oxygen-producing  plankton <period> also  it  's  bad  news  for  us <period> we  're  putting  hundreds  of  millions  of  tons  of  plastic  and  other  trash  into  the  sea <period> millions  of  tons  of  discarded  fishing  nets <comma> gear  that  continues  to  kill <period> we  're  clogging  the  ocean <comma> poisoning  the  planet  's  circulatory  system <comma> and  we  're  taking  out  hundreds  of  millions  of  tons  of

 the  carbon  cycle <comma> the  nitrogen  cycle <comma> the  oxygen  cycle <comma> the  water  cycle <comma> our  life  support  system <period> we  're  still  killing  bluefin  tuna <period> truly  endangered  and  much  more  valuable  alive  than  dead <period> all  of  these  parts  are  part  of  our  life  support  system <period> we  kill  using  long  lines <comma> with  baited  hooks  every  few  feet  that  may  stretch  for  50  miles  or  more <period> industrial  trawlers  and  draggers  are  scraping  the  sea  floor  like  bulldozers <comma> taking  everything  in  their

<comma> leaving  plumes  of  death  in  their  path <period> the  next  time  you  dine  on  sushi <comma> or  sashimi <comma> or  swordfish  steak <comma> or  shrimp  cocktail <comma> whatever  wildlife  you  happen  to  enjoy  from  the  ocean <comma> think  of  the  real  cost <period> for  every  pound  that  goes  to  market <comma> more  than  10  pounds <comma> even  100  pounds <comma> may  be  thrown  away  as  bycatch <period> this  is  the  consequence  of  not  knowing  that  there  are  limits  to  what  we  can  take  out  of  the  sea <period> this  chart  shows  the  decline  in  ocean  wildlife  from  1900  to  2000 <period> the  highest  concentrations  are  in  red <period> in  my  lifetime <comma> imagine <comma> 90  percent  of  the  big  fish  have  been  killed <period> most  of  the  turtles <comma> sharks <comma> tunas  and  whales  are  way  down  in  numbers <period> but <comma> there  is  good  news <period> ten  percent  of  the  big  fish  still  remain <period> there  are  still  some  blue  whales <period> there  are  still  some  krill  in  antarctica <period> there  are  a  few  oysters  in  chesapeake  bay <period> half  the  coral

<period> but  business  as  usual  means  that  in  50  years <comma> there  may  be  no  coral  reefs <comma> and  no  commercial  fishing <comma> because  the  fish  will  simply  be  gone <period> imagine  the  ocean  without  fish <period> imagine  what  that  means  to  our  life  support  system <period> natural  systems  on  the  land  are  in  big  trouble  too <comma> but  the  problems  are  more  obvious <comma> and  some  actions  are  being  taken  to  protect  trees <comma> watersheds  and  wildlife <period> and  in  1872 <comma> with  yellowstone  national  park <comma> the  united  states  began  establishing  a  system  of  parks  that  some  say  was  the  best  idea  america  ever  had <period> about  12  percent  of  the  land  around  the  world  is  now  protected <comma> safeguarding  biodiversity <comma> providing  a  carbon  sink <comma> generating  oxygen <comma> protecting  watersheds <period> and <comma> in  1972 <comma> this  nation  began  to  establish  a  counterpart  in  the  sea <comma> national  marine  sanctuaries <period> that  's  another  great  idea <period> the  good  news  is  that  there  are  now  more  than  4,000  places  in  the  sea <comma> around  the  world <comma> that  have  some  kind  of  protection <period> and  you  can  find  them  on  google  earth <period> the  bad  news  is  that  you  have  to  look  hard  to  find  them <period> in  the  last  three  years <comma> for  example <comma> the  us <period> protected  340,000  square  miles  of  ocean  as  national  monuments <period> but  it  only  increased  from  06  of  one  percent  to  08  of  one  percent  of  the  ocean  protected <comma> globally <period> protected  areas  do  rebound <comma> but  it  takes  a  long  time  to  restore  50-year-old

new  ways <comma> better  ways <comma> to  cope  with  poverty <comma> wars  and  disease <period> we  need  many  things  to  keep  and  maintain  the  world  as  a  better  place <period> but <comma> nothing  else  will  matter  if  we  fail  to  protect  the  ocean <period> our  fate  and  the  ocean  's  are  one <period> we  need  to  do  for  the  ocean  what  al  gore  did  for  the

ca <comma> ok <period> now <comma> you  're  19  now <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> i  'm  19  years  now <period> ca <comma> five  years  ago  you  had  an  idea <period> what  was  that <questionmark> wk <comma> i  wanted  to  make  a  windmill <period> ca <comma> a  windmill <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> what <comma> to  power <comma> for  lighting  and  stuff <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> so  what  did  you  do <questionmark> how  did  you  realize  that <questionmark> wk <comma> after  i  dropped  out  of  school <comma> i  went  to  library <comma> and  i  read  a  book  that  would <comma> using  energy <comma> and  i  get  information  about  doing  the  mill <period> and  i  tried <comma> and  i  made  it <period> ca <comma> so  you  copied <comma> you  exactly  copied  the  design  in  the  book <period> wk <comma> ah <comma> no <period> i  just <comma> ca <comma> what  happened <questionmark> wk <comma> in  fact <comma> a  design  of  the  windmill  that  was  in  the  book <comma> it  has  got  four <comma> ah <comma> three  blades <comma> and  mine  has  got  four  blades <period> ca <comma> the  book  had  three <comma> yours  had  four <period> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> and  you  made  it  out  of  what <questionmark> wk <comma> i  made  four  blades <comma> just  because  i  want  to  increase  power <period> ca <comma> ok <period> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> you  tested  three <comma> and  found  that  four  worked  better <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> i  test <period> ca <comma> and  what  did  you  make  the  windmill  out  of <questionmark> what  materials  did  you  use <questionmark> wk <comma> i  use  a  bicycle  frame <comma> and  a  pulley <comma> and  plastic  pipe <comma> what  then  pulls <comma> ca <comma> do  we  have  a  picture  of  that <questionmark> can  we  have  the  next  slide <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> the  windmill <period> ca <comma> and  so <comma> and  that  windmill <comma> what <comma> it  worked <questionmark> wk <comma> when  the  wind  blows <comma> it  rotates  and  generates <period> ca <comma> how  much  electricity <questionmark> wk <comma> 12  watts <period> ca <comma> and  so <comma> that  lit  a  light  for  the  house <questionmark> how  many  lights <questionmark> wk <comma> four  bulbs  and  two  radios <period> ca <comma> wow <period> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> next  slide <comma> so  who  's  that <questionmark> wk <comma> this  is  my  parents <comma> holding  the  radio <period> ca <comma> so  what  did  they  make  of <comma> that  you  were  14 <comma> 15  at  the  time <comma> what  did  they  make  of  this <questionmark> they  were  impressed <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> and  so  what  's  your <comma> what  are  you  going  to  do  with  this <questionmark> wk <comma> um <comma> ca <comma> what  do  you <comma> i  mean <comma> do  you  want  to  build  another  one <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <comma> i  want  to  build  another  one <comma> to  pump  water  and  irrigation  for  crops <period> ca <comma> so  this  one  would  have  to  be  bigger <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> how  big <questionmark> wk <comma> i  think  it  will  produce  more  than  20  the  watts <period> ca <comma> so  that  would  produce  irrigation  for  the  entire  village <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> wow <period> and  so  you  're  talking  to  people  here  at  ted  to  get  people  who  might  be  able  to  help  in  some  way  to  realize  this  dream <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <comma> if  they  can  help  me  with  materials <comma> yeah <period> ca <comma> and  as  you  think  of  your  life  going  forward <comma> you  're  19  now <comma> do  you  picture  continuing  with  this  dream  of  working  in  energy <questionmark> wk <comma> yeah <period> i  'm  still  thinking  to  work  on  energy <period> ca <comma> wow <period> william <comma> it  's  a  real  honor  to  have  you  at  the  ted  conference <period> thank  you  so  much  for  coming <period> wk <comma> thank  you <period> how  many  creationists  do  we  have  in  the  room <questionmark> probably  none <period> i  think  we  're  all  darwinians <period> and  yet  many  darwinians  are  anxious <comma> a  little  uneasy <comma> would  like  to  see  some  limits  on  just  how  far  the  darwinism  goes <period> you  know  spiderwebs <questionmark> sure <comma> they  are  products  of  evolution <period> the  world  wide  web <questionmark> not  so  sure <period> beaver  dams <comma> yes <period> hoover  dam <comma> no <period> what  do  they  think  it  is  that  prevents  the  products  of  human  ingenuity  from  being  themselves <comma> fruits  of  the  tree  of  life <comma> and  hence <comma> in  some  sense <comma> obeying  evolutionary  rules <questionmark> and  yet  people  are  interestingly  resistant  to  the  idea  of  applying  evolutionary  thinking  to  thinking <comma> to  our  thinking <period> and  so  i  'm  going  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  that <comma> keeping  in  mind  that  we  have  a  lot  on  the  program  here <period> so  you  're  out  in  the  woods <comma> or  you  're  out  in  the  pasture <comma> and  you  see  this  ant  crawling  up  this  blade  of  grass <period> it  climbs  up  to  the  top <comma> and  it  falls <comma> and  it  climbs <comma> and  it  falls <comma> and  it  climbs  -- <period> trying  to  stay  at  the  very  top  of  the  blade  of  grass <period> what  is  this  ant  doing <questionmark> what  is  this  in  aid  of <questionmark> what  goals  is  this  ant  trying  to  achieve  by  climbing  this  blade  of  grass <questionmark> what  's  in  it  for  the  ant <questionmark> and  the  answer  is <comma> nothing <period> there  's  nothing  in  it  for  the  ant <period> well  then <comma> why  is  it  doing  this <questionmark> is  it  just  a  fluke <questionmark> yeah <comma> it  's  just  a  fluke <period> it  's  a  lancet  fluke <period> it  's  a  little  brain  worm <period> it  's  a  parasitic  brain  worm  that  has  to  get  into  the  stomach  of  a  sheep  or  a  cow  in  order  to  continue  its  life  cycle <period> salmon  swim  upstream  to  get  to  their  spawning  grounds <comma> and  lancet  flukes  commandeer  a  passing  ant <comma> crawl  into  its  brain <comma> and  drive  it  up  a  blade  of  grass  like  an  all-terrain  vehicle <period> so  there  's  nothing  in  it  for  the  ant <period> the  ant  's  brain  has  been  hijacked  by  a  parasite  that  infects  the  brain <comma> inducing  suicidal  behavior <period> pretty  scary <period> well <comma> does  anything  like  that  happen  with  human  beings <questionmark> this  is  all  on  behalf  of  a  cause  other  than  one  's  own  genetic  fitness <comma> of  course <period> well <comma> it  may  already  have  occurred  to  you  that  islam  means  surrender <comma> or  submission  of  self-interest  to  the  will  of  allah <period> well <comma> it  's  ideas <comma> not  worms <comma> that  hijack  our  brains <period> now <comma> am  i  saying  that  a  sizable  minority  of  the  world  's  population  has  had  their  brain  hijacked  by  parasitic  ideas <questionmark> no <comma> it  's  worse  than  that <period> most  people  have <period> there  are  a  lot  of  ideas  to  die  for <period> freedom <comma> if  you  're  from  new  hampshire <period> justice <period> truth <period> communism <period> many  people  have  laid  down  their  lives  for  communism <period> and  many  have  laid  down  their  lives  for  capitalism <period> and  many  for  catholicism <period> and  many  for  islam <period> these  are  just  a  few  of  the  ideas  that  are  to  die  for <period> they  're  infectious <period> yesterday <comma> amory  lovins  spoke  about  infectious  repititis  it  was  a  term  of  abuse <comma> in  effect <period> this  is  unthinking  engineering <period> well <comma> most  of  the  cultural  spread  that  goes  on  is  not  brilliant <comma> new <comma> out-of-the-box  thinking <period> it  's  infectious  repetitis <period> and  we  might  as  well  try  to  have  a  theory  of  what  's  going  on  when  that  happens  so  that  we  can  understand  the  conditions  of  infection <period> hosts  work  hard  to  spread  these  ideas  to  others <period> i  myself  am  a  philosopher <comma> and  one  of  our  occupational  hazards  is  that  people  ask  us  what  the  meaning  of  life  is <period> and  you  have  to  have  a  bumper  sticker <comma> you  know <period> you  have  to  have  a  statement <period> so <comma> this  is  mine <period> the  secret  of  happiness  is <comma> find  something  more  important  than  you  are  and  dedicate  your  life  to  it <period> most  of  us <comma> now  that  the  me  decade  is  well  in  the  past <comma> now  we  actually  do  this <period> one  set  of  ideas  or  another  have  simply  replaced  our  biological  imperatives  in  our  own  lives <period> this  is  what  our  summum  bonum  is <period> it  's  not  maximizing  the  number  of  grandchildren  we  have <period> now <comma> this  is  a  profound  biological  effect <period> it  's  the  subordination  of  genetic  interest  to  other  interests <period> and  no  other  species  does  anything  at  all  like  it <period> well <comma> how  are  we  going  to  think  about  this <questionmark> it  is <comma> on  the  one  hand <comma> a  biological  effect <comma> and  a  very  large  one <period> unmistakable <period> now <comma> what  theories  do  we  want  to  use  to  look  at  this <questionmark> well <comma> many  theories <period> but  how  could  something  tie  them  together <questionmark> the  idea  of  replicating  ideas <period> ideas  that  replicate  by  passing  from  brain  to  brain <period> richard  dawkins <comma> whom  you  'll  be  hearing  later  in  the  day <comma> invented  the  term  memes <comma> and  put  forward  the  first  really  clear  and  vivid  version  of  this  idea  in  his  book  the  selfish  gene <period> now  here  am  i  talking  about  his  idea <period> well <comma> you  see <comma> it  's  not  his <period> yes <comma> he  started  it <period> but  it  's  everybody  's  idea  now <period> and  he  's  not  responsible  for  what  i  say  about  memes <period> i  'm  responsible  for  what  i  say  about  memes <period> actually <comma> i  think  we  're  all  responsible  for  not  just  the  intended  effects  of  our  ideas <comma> but  for  their  likely  misuses <period> so  it  is  important <comma> i  think <comma> to  richard <comma> and  to  me <comma> that  these  ideas  not  be  abused  and  misused <period> they  're  very  easy  to  misuse <period> that  's  why  they  're  dangerous <period> and  it  's  just  about  a  full-time  job  trying  to  prevent  people  who  are  scared  of  these  ideas  from  caricaturing  them  and  then  running  off  to  one  dire  purpose  or  another <period> so  we  have  to  keep  plugging  away <comma> trying  to  correct  the  misapprehensions  so  that  only  the  benign  and  useful  variants  of  our  ideas  continue  to  spread <period> but  it  is  a  problem <period> we  do  n't  have  much  time <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  go  over  just  a  little  bit  of  this  and  cut  out <comma> because  there  's  a  lot  of  other  things  that  are  going  to  be  said <period> so  let  me  just  point  out <comma> memes  are  like  viruses <period> that  's  what  richard  said <comma> back  in  93 <period> and  you  might  think <comma> well <comma> how  can  that  be <questionmark> i  mean <comma> a  virus  is <comma> you  know <comma> it  's  stuff <period> what  's  a  meme  made  of <questionmark> yesterday <comma> negroponte  was  talking  about  viral  telecommunications  but <comma> what  's  a  virus <questionmark> a  virus  is  a  string  of  nucleic  acid  with  attitude <period> that  is <comma> there  is  something  about  it  that  tends  to  make  it  replicate  better  than  the  competition  does <period> and  that  's  what  a  meme  is <period> it  's  an  information  packet  with  attitude <period> what  's  a  meme  made  of <questionmark> what  are  bits  made  of <comma> mom <questionmark> not  silicon <period> they  're  made  of  information <comma> and  can  be  carried  in  any  physical  medium <period> what  's  a  word  made  of <questionmark> sometimes  when  people  say <comma> do  memes  exist <questionmark> i  say <comma> well <comma> do  words  exist <questionmark> are  they  in  your  ontology <questionmark> if  they  are <comma> words  are  memes  that  can  be  pronounced <period> then  there  's  all  the  other  memes  that  cannot  be  pronounced <period> there  are  different  species  of  memes <period> remember  the  shakers <questionmark> gift  to  be  simple <questionmark> simple <comma> beautiful  furniture <questionmark> and <comma> of  course <comma> they  're  basically  extinct  now <period> and  one  of  the  reasons  is  that  among  the  creed  of  shaker-dom  is  that  one  should  be  celibate <period> not  just  the  priests <period> everybody <period> well <comma> it  's  not  so  surprising  that  they've  gone  extinct <period> but  in  fact  that  's  not  why  they  went  extinct <period> they  survived  as  long  as  they  did  at  a  time  when  the  social  safety  nets  were  n't  there <period> and  there  were  lots  of  widows  and  orphans <comma> people  like  that <comma> who  needed  a  foster  home <period> and  so  they  had  a  ready  supply  of  converts <period> and  they  could  keep  it  going <period> and <comma> in  principle <comma> it  could've  gone  on  forever <period> with  perfect  celibacy  on  the  part  of  the  hosts <period> the  idea  being  passed  on  through  proselytizing <comma> instead  of  through  the  gene  line <period> so  the  ideas  can  live  on  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  they  're  not  being  passed  on  genetically <period> a  meme  can  flourish  in  spite  of  having  a  negative  impact  on  genetic  fitness <period> after  all <comma> the  meme  for  shaker-dom  was  essentially  a  sterilizing  parasite <period> there  are  other  parasites  that  do  this <comma> which  render  the  host  sterile <period> it  's  part  of  their  plan <period> they  do  n't  have  to  have  minds  to  have  a  plan <period> i  'm  just  going  to  draw  your  attention  to  just  one  of  the  many  implications  of  the  memetic  perspective <comma> which  i  recommend <period> i've  not  time  to  go  into  more  of  it <period> in  jared  diamond  's  wonderful  book <comma> guns <comma> germs  and  steel <comma> he  talks  about  how  it  was  germs <comma> more  than  guns  and  steel <comma> that  conquered  the  new  hemisphere <comma> the  western  hemisphere  -- <period> that  conquered  the  rest  of  the  world <period> when  european  explorers  and  travelers  spread  out <comma> they  brought  with  them  the  germs  that  they  had  become  essentially  immune  to <comma> that  they  had  learned  how  to  tolerate  over  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  years <comma> thousands  of  years <comma> of  living  with  domesticated  animals  who  were  the  sources  of  those  pathogens <period> and  they  just  wiped  out <comma> these  pathogens  just  wiped  out  the  native  people <comma> who  had  no  immunity  to  them  at  all <period> and  we  're  doing  it  again <period> we  're  doing  it  this  time  with  toxic  ideas <period> yesterday <comma> a  number  of  people <comma> nicholas  negroponte  and  others <comma> spoke  about  all  the  wonderful  things  that  are  happening  when  our  ideas  get  spread  out <comma> thanks  to  all  the  new  technology  all  over  the  world <period> and  i  agree <period> it  is  largely  wonderful <period> largely  wonderful <period> but  among  all  those  ideas  that  inevitably  flow  out  into  the  whole  world  thanks  to  our  technology <comma> are  a  lot  of  toxic  ideas <period> now <comma> this  has  been  realized  for  some  time <period> sayyid  qutb  is  one  of  the  founding  fathers  of  fanatical  islam <comma> one  of  the  ideologues  that  inspired  osama  bin  laden <period> one  has  only  to  glance  at  its  press  films <comma> fashion  shows <comma> beauty  contests <comma> ballrooms <comma> wine  bars  and  broadcasting  stations  memes <period> these  memes  are  spreading  around  the  world  and  they  are  wiping  out  whole  cultures <period> they  are  wiping  out  languages <period> they  are  wiping  out  traditions  and  practices <period> and  it  's  not  our  fault <comma> anymore  than  it  's  our  fault  when  our  germs  lay  waste  to  people  that  have  n't  developed  the  immunity <period> we  have  an  immunity  to  all  of  the  junk  that  lies  around  the  edges  of  our  culture <period> we  're  a  free  society <comma> so  we  let  pornography  and  all  these  things <comma> we  shrug  them  off <period> they  're  like  a  mild  cold <period> they  're  not  a  big  deal  for  us <period> but  we  should  recognize  that  for  many  people  in  the  world <comma> they  are  a  big  deal <period> and  we  should  be  very  alert  to  this <period> as  we  spread  our  education  and  our  technology <comma> one  of  the  things  that  we  are  doing  is  we  're  the  vectors  of  memes  that  are  correctly  viewed  by  the  hosts  of  many  other  memes  as  a  dire  threat  to  their  favorite  memes <comma> the  memes  that  they  are  prepared  to  die  for <period> well  now <comma> how  are  we  going  to  tell  the  good  memes  from  the  bad  memes <questionmark> that  is  not  the  job  of  the  science  of  memetics <period> memetics  is  morally  neutral <period> and  so  it  should  be <period> this  is  not  the  place  for  hate  and  anger <period> if  you've  had  a  friend  who  's  died  of  aids <comma> then  you  hate  hiv <period> but  the  way  to  deal  with  that  is  to  do  science <comma> and  understand  how  it  spreads  and  why  in  a  morally  neutral  perspective <period> get  the  facts <period> work  out  the  implications <period> there  's  plenty  of  room  for  moral  passion  once  we've  got  the  facts  and  can  figure  out  the  best  thing  to  do <period> and <comma> as  with  germs <comma> the  trick  is  not  to  try  to  annihilate  them <period> you  will  never  annihilate  the  germs <period> what  you  can  do <comma> however <comma> is  foster  public  health  measures  and  the  like  that  will  encourage  the  evolution  of  avirulence <period> that  will  encourage  the  spread  of  relatively  benign  mutations  of  the  most  toxic  varieties <period> that  's  all  the  time  i  have <comma> so  thank  you  very  much  for  your  attention <period> i  'm  rich  baraniuk <period> and  what  i'd  like  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  today  are  some  ideas  that  i  think  have  just  tremendous  resonance  with  all  the  things  that  have  been  talked  about  the  last  two  days <period> in  fact <comma> so  many  different  points  of  resonance  that  it  's  going  to  be  difficult  to  bring  them  all  up <comma> but  i  'll  try  to  do  my  best <period> does  anybody  remember  these <questionmark> ok <comma> so  these  are  lp  records  and  they've  been  replaced <comma> right <questionmark> they've  been  swept  away  over  the  last  two  decades  by  these  types  of  world-flattening  digitization  technologies <comma> right <questionmark> and  i  think  it  was  best  witnessed  when  thomas  was  playing  the  music  as  we  came  in  the  room  today <period> what  's  happened  in  the  music  world  is  there  's  a  culture  or  an  ecosystem  that  's  been  created  that <comma> if  you  take  some  words  from  apple <comma> the  catchphrase  that  we  create <comma> rip <comma> mix  and  burn <period> what  i  mean  by  that  is  that  anyone  in  the  world  is  free  and  allowed  to  create  new  music  and  musical  ideas <period> anyone  in  the  world  is  allowed  to  rip  or  copy  musical  ideas <comma> use  them  in  innovative  ways <period> anyone  is  allowed  to  mix  them  in  different  types  of  ways <comma> draw  connections  between  musical  ideas  and  people  can  burn  them  or  create  final  products  and  continue  the  circle <period> and  what  that  's  done  is  it  's  created <comma> like  i  said <comma> a  vibrant  community  that  's  very  inclusive  with  people  continually  working  to  connect  musical  ideas <comma> innovate  them  and  keep  things  constantly  up  to  date <period> today  's  hit  single  is  not  last  year  's  hit  single <period> but <comma> i  'm  not  here  to  talk  about  music  today <period> i  'm  here  to  talk  about  books <period> in  particular <comma> textbooks  and  the  kind  of  educational  materials  that  we  use  every  day  in  school <period> has  anyone  here  ever  been  to  school <questionmark> ok <comma> does  anybody  realize  there  's  a  crisis  in  our  schools <comma> around  the  world <questionmark> ok <comma> i  'm  not  going  to  spend  too  much  time  on  that <comma> but  what  i  want  to  talk  about  is  some  of  the  disconnects  that  appear  when  an  author  publishes  a  book  that  in  fact <comma> the  publishing  process <comma> just  because  of  the  fact  that  it  's  complicated <comma> it  's  heavy <comma> books  are  expensive <comma> creates  a  sort  of  a  wall  between  authors  of  books  and  the  ultimate  users  of  books <comma> be  they  teachers <comma> students  or  just  general  readers <period> and  this  is  even  more  true  if  you  happen  to  speak  a  language  other  than  one  of  the  world  's  major  languages <comma> and  especially  english <period> and  i  'm  going  to  call  these  people  below  the  barrier  shut-outs <comma> because  they  're  really  shut  out  of  the  process  of  being  able  to  share  their  knowledge  with  the  world <period> and  so  what  i  want  to  talk  about  today  is  trying  to  take  these  ideas  that  we've  seen  in  the  musical  culture  and  try  to  bring  these  towards  reinventing  the  way  we  think  about  writing  books <comma> using  them  and  teaching  from  them <period> so <comma> that  's  what  i'd  like  to  talk  about  and  really <comma> how  do  we  get  from  where  we  are  now  to  where  we  need  to  go <questionmark> so <comma> the  first  thing  i'd  like  you  to  do  is  a  little  thought  experiment <period> so <comma> imagine  taking  all  the  world  's  books <period> ok <comma> everybody  imagine  books  and  imagine  just  tearing  out  the  pages <period> so <comma> liberating  these  pages  and  imagine  digitizing  them  and  then  storing  them  in  a  vast <comma> interconnected <comma> global  repository <period> think  of  it  as  a  massive  itunes  for  book  type  content <period> and  then  take  that  material  and  imagine  making  it  all  open <comma> so  that  people  can  modify  it <comma> play  with  it <comma> improve  it <period> imagine  making  it  free <comma> so  that  anyone  in  the  world  can  have  access  to  all  of  this  knowledge <comma> and  imagine  using  information  technology  so  that  you  can  update  this  content <comma> improve  it <comma> play  with  it <comma> on  a  timescale  that  's  more  on  the  order  of  seconds  instead  of  years <period> instead  of  editions  coming  out  every  two  years <comma> of  a  book <comma> imagine  it  coming  out  every  25  seconds <period> so <comma> imagine  we  could  do  that  and  imagine  we  could  put  people  into  this <period> so  that  we  could  truly  build  an  ecosystem  with  not  just  authors <comma> but  all  the  people  who  could  be  or  want  to  be  authors  in  all  the  different  languages  of  the  world <comma> and  i  think  if  you  could  do  this <comma> it  would  be  called <comma> well <comma> i  'm  just  going  to  refer  to  it  as  a  knowledge  ecosystem <period> so <comma> really <comma> this  is  the  dream  and  in  a  sense  what  you  can  think  of  it  is  we  are  trying  to  enable  anyone  in  the  world <comma> i  mean  anyone  in  the  world <comma> to  be  their  own  educational  dj <period> creating  educational  materials <comma> sharing  them  with  the  world <comma> constantly  innovating  on  them <period> so <comma> this  is  the  dream <period> in  fact <comma> this  dream  is  actually  being  realized <period> over  the  last  six-and-a-half  years <comma> we've  been  working  really  hard  at  rice  university  on  a  project  called  connexions <comma> and  so  what  i'd  like  to  do  for  the  rest  of  the  talk  is  just  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  what  people  are  doing  with  connexions <comma> which  you  can  kind  of  think  of  as  the  counterpoint  to  nicholas  negroponte  's  talk  yesterday <comma> where  they  're  working  on  the  hardware  of  bringing  education  to  the  world <period> we  're  working  on  the  open-source  tools  and  the  content <period> so <comma> that  's  sort  of  to  put  it  in  perspective  here <period> so <comma> create <period> so  what  are  some  of  the  people  that  are  using  these  kind  of  tools <questionmark> well <comma> the  first  thing  is  there  's  a  community  of  engineering  professors <comma> from  cambridge  to  kyoto <comma> who  are  developing  engineering  content  in  electrical  engineering  to  develop  what  you  can  think  of  as  a  massive <comma> super  textbook  that  covers  the  entire  area  of  electrical  engineering <comma> and  not  only  that <comma> it  can  be  customized  for  use  in  each  of  their  own  individual  institutions <period> if  people  like  kitty  jones <comma> right <comma> a  shut-out <comma> a  private  music  teacher  and  mom  from  champagne <comma> illinois <comma> who  wanted  to  share  her  fantastic  music  content  with  the  world <comma> on  how  to  teach  kids  how  to  play  music <period> her  material  is  now  used  over  600,000  times  per  month <period> tremendous <comma> tremendous  use <period> in  fact <comma> a  lot  of  this  use  coming  from  unites  states <comma> k-through-12  schools  because  anyone  who  's  involved  in  a  school  scale  back <comma> the  first  thing  that  's  cut  is  the  music  curriculum  and  so  this  is  just  indicating  the  tremendous  thirst  for  this  kind  of  open <comma> free  content <period> a  lot  of  teachers  are  using  this  stuff <period> ok <comma> what  about  ripping <questionmark> what  about  copying <comma> reusing <comma> right <questionmark> a  team  of  volunteers  at  the  university  of  texas  el  paso <comma> graduate  students  translating  this  engineering  super  textbook  ideas  and  within  about  a  week <comma> having  this  be  some  of  our  most  popular  material  in  widespread  use  all  over  latin  america  and  in  particular  in  mexico <comma> because  of  the  open  extensible  nature  of  this <period> people <comma> volunteers  and  even  companies  that  are  translating  material  into  asian  languages  like  chinese <comma> japanese  and  thai <comma> to  spread  the  knowledge  even  further <period> ok <comma> what  about  people  who  are  mixing <questionmark> what  does  mixing  mean <questionmark> mixing  means  building  customized  courses <comma> means  building  customized  books <period> companies  like  national  instruments <comma> who  are  embedding  very  powerful <comma> interactive  simulations  into  the  materials <comma> so  that  we  can  go  way  beyond  our  regular  kind  of  textbook  to  an  experience  that  all  the  teaching  materials  are  things  you  can  actually  interact  with  and  play  around  with  and  actually  learn  as  you  do <period> we've  been  working  with  teachers  without  borders  who  are  very  interested  in  mixing  our  materials <period> they  're  going  to  be  using  connexions  as  their  platform  to  develop  and  deliver  teaching  materials  for  teaching  teachers  how  to  teach  in  84  countries  that  are  around  the  world <period> twb  is  currently  in  iraq  training  20,000  teachers  supported  by  usaid  and  to  them <comma> this  idea  of  being  able  to  remix  and  customize  to  the  local  context  is  extraordinarily  important <comma> because  just  providing  free  content  to  people  has  actually  been  likened  by  people  in  the  developing  world  to  a  kind  of  cultural  imperialism <comma> that  if  you  do  n't  empower  people  with  the  ability  to  re-contextualize  the  material <comma> translate  it  into  their  own  language  and  take  ownership  of  it <comma> it  's  not  good <period> ok <comma> other  organizations  we've  been  working  with <comma> uc  merced <comma> people  know  about  uc  merced <period> it  's  a  new  university  in  california <comma> in  the  central  valley <comma> working  very  closely  with  community  colleges <period> they  're  actually  developing  a  lot  of  their  science  and  engineering  curriculum  to  spread  widely  around  the  world  in  our  system  and  they  're  also  trying  to  develop  all  of  their  software  tools  completely  open-source <period> we've  been  working  with  amd <comma> which  has  a  project  called  50  by  15 <comma> which  is  trying  to  bring  internet  connectivity  to  50  percent  of  the  world  's  population  by  2015 <period> we  're  going  to  be  providing  content  to  them  in  a  whole  range  of  different  languages <period> and  we've  also  been  working  with  a  number  of  other  organizations <period> in  particular <comma> a  bunch  of  the  projects  that  are  funded  by  hewlett  foundation <comma> who  have  taken  a  real  leadership  role  in  this  area  of  open  content <period> ok <comma> burn <comma> i  think  this  is  sort  of <comma> quite  interesting <period> burn  is  the  idea  of  trying  to  create  the  physical  instantiation  of  one  of  these  courses <period> and  i  think  a  lot  of  you  received <comma> i  think  all  of  you  received  one  of  these  music  books  in  your  gift  pack <period> a  little  present  for  you <period> just  to  tell  you  quickly  about  it <comma> this  is  an  engineering  textbook <period> it  's  about  300  pages  long <comma> hardbound <period> this  costs <comma> anybody  guess <questionmark> how  much  would  it  cost  in  a  bookstore <questionmark> audience <comma> 65  dollars <period> richard  baraniuk <comma> this  costs  22  dollars  to  the  student <period> why  does  it  cost  22  dollars <questionmark> because  it  's  published  on  demand  and  it  's  developed  from  this  repository  of  open  materials <period> if  this  book  were  to  be  published  by  a  regular  publisher <comma> it  would  cost  at  least  122  dollars <period> so  what  we  're  seeing  is  moving  this  burning  or  publication  process  from  the  regular  sort  of  single-authored  book  towards  community-authored  materials  that  are  modular <comma> that  are  customized  to  each  individual  class  and  published  on  demand  very  inexpensively <comma> either  pushed  out  through  amazon <comma> or  published  directly  through  an  on-demand  press <comma> like  coop <period> and  i  think  that  this  is  an  extraordinarily  interesting  area  because  there  is  tremendous  area  under  this  long  tail  in  publishing <period> we  're  not  talking  about  the  harry  potter  end <comma> right  at  the  left  side <period> we  're  talking  about  books  on  hyper  geometric  partial  differential  equations <period> right <comma> books  that  might  sell  100  copies  a  year <comma> 1,000  copies  a  year <period> there  is  tremendous  sustaining  revenue  under  this  long  tail  to  sustain  open  projects  like  ours <comma> but  also  to  sustain  this  new  emergence  of  on-demand  publishers <comma> like  coop <comma> who  produced  these  two  books <period> and  i  think  one  of  the  things  that  you  should  take  away  from  this  talk <comma> is  that  there  's  an  impending  cut-out-the-middle-man <comma> disintermediation <comma> that  's  going  to  be  happening  in  the  publishing  industry <comma> and  it  's  going  to  reach  a  crescendo  over  the  next  few  years <comma> and  i  think  that  it  's  for  our  benefit <comma> really <comma> and  for  the  world  's  benefit <period> ok <comma> so  what  are  the  enablers <questionmark> what  's  really  making  all  of  this  happen <questionmark> there  's  tons  of  technology <comma> and  the  only  piece  of  technology  that  i  really  want  to  talk  about  is  xml <period> how  many  people  know  about  xml <questionmark> oh <comma> great <comma> so  it  's  the  future  of  the  web <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  semantic  representation  of  comment <comma> content <comma> and  what  you  can  really  think  of  xml  in  this  case <comma> is  it  's  the  packaging  that  we  're  putting  around  these  pages <period> remember  we  took  the  book <comma> tore  the  pages  out <questionmark> well <comma> what  the  xml  is  going  to  do  is  it  's  going  to  turn  those  pages  into  lego  blocks <period> xml  are  the  nubs  on  the  lego  that  allow  us  to  combine  the  content  together  in  myriad  different  ways <comma> and  it  provides  us  a  framework  to  share  content <period> so <comma> it  lets  you  take  this  ecosystem  in  its  primordial  state <comma> right <comma> of  all  this  content <comma> all  the  pages  you've  torn  out  of  books <comma> and  create  highly  sophisticated  learning  machines: <period> books <comma> courses <comma> course  packs <period> it  gives  you  the  ability  to  personalize  the  learning  experience  to  each  individual  student <comma> so  that  every  student  can  have  a  book  or  a  course  that  's  customized  to  their  learning  style <comma> their  context <comma> their  language  and  the  things  that  excite  them <period> it  lets  you  reuse  the  same  materials  in  multiple  different  ways  and  surprising  new  ways <period> it  lets  you  interconnect  ideas  indicating  how  fields  relate  to  each  other <comma> and  i  'll  just  give  you  my  personal  story <period> we  came  up  with  this  six-and-a-half  years  ago  because  i  teach  the  stuff  in  the  red  box <period> and  my  day  job <comma> as  chris  said <comma> i  'm  an  electrical  engineering  professor <period> i  teach  signal  processing  and  my  challenge  was  to  show  that  this  math <comma> wow <comma> about  half  of  you  have  already  fallen  asleep  just  looking  at  the  equation <comma> but  this  seemingly  dry  math  is  actually  the  center  of  this  tremendously  powerful  web  that  links  technology <comma> that  links  really  cool  applications  like  music  synthesizers  to  tremendous  economic  opportunities <comma> but  also  governed  by  intellectual  property <period> and  the  thing  that  i  realized  is  there  was  no  way  that  i <comma> as  an  engineer <comma> could  write  this  book  that  would  get  all  of  this  across <period> we  needed  a  community  to  do  it  and  we  needed  new  tools  to  be  able  to  interconnect  these  ideas <comma> and  i  think  that  really <comma> in  a  sense <comma> what  we  're  trying  to  do  is  make  minsky  's  dream  come  to  a  reality <comma> where  you  can  imagine  all  the  books  in  a  library  actually  starting  to  talk  to  each  other <period> and  people  who  are  teachers  out  here <comma> whoever  taught <comma> you  know  this  -- <period> it  's  the  interconnections  between  ideas  that  teaching  is  really  all  about <period> ok <comma> back  to  math <period> imagine  this  is  possible  -- <period> that  every  single  equation  that  you  click  on  in  one  of  your  new  e-texts  is  something  that  you  're  going  to  be  able  to  explore  and  experiment  with <period> so  imagine  your  kid  's  algebra  textbook  in  seventh  grade <period> you  can  click  on  every  single  equation  and  bring  up  a  little  tool  to  be  able  to  experiment  with  it <comma> tinker  with  it <comma> understand  it <comma> because  we  really  do  n't  understand  until  we  do <period> the  same  type  of  mark-up <comma> like  mathml <comma> for  chemistry <period> imagine  chemistry  textbooks  that  actually  understand  the  structure  of  how  molecules  are  formed <period> imagine  music  xml  that  actually  lets  you  delve  into  the  semantic  structure  of  music <comma> play  with  it <comma> understand  it <period> it  's  no  wonder  that  everybody  's  getting  into  it <comma> right <questionmark> even  the  three  wise  men <period> ok <comma> the  second  big  enabler <comma> and  this  is  where  i  told  a  big  lie <period> the  second  big  enabler  is  intellectual  property <comma> because  in  fact  i  got  up  here  and  i  talked  about  how  great  the  music  culture  is <period> we  can  share  and  rip <comma> mix  and  burn <comma> but  in  fact  that  's  all  illegal <period> and  we  would  be  accused  of  pirates  for  doing  that <comma> because  this  music  has  been  propertized <period> it  's  now  owned <comma> right <comma> much  of  it  by  big  industries <period> so <comma> really <comma> the  key  thing  here  is  we  cannot  let  this  happen <period> we  cannot  let  this  napster  thing  happen  here <period> so <comma> what  we  have  to  do  is  get  it  right  from  the  very  beginning  and  what  we  have  to  do  is  find  an  intellectual  property  framework  that  makes  sharing  safe <comma> and  makes  it  easily  understandable <comma> and  the  inspiration  here  is  taken  from  open-source  software <comma> things  like  linux  and  the  gpl <period> and  the  ideas <comma> the  creative  commons  licenses <period> how  many  people  have  heard  of  creative  commons <questionmark> if  you  have  not <comma> you  must  learn  about  it <period> creativecommonsorg <period> at  the  bottom  of  every  piece  of  material  in  connexions  and  in  lots  of  other  projects <comma> you  can  find  their  logo <period> clicking  on  that  logo  takes  you  to  an  absolute  no-nonsense <comma> human-readable  document <comma> a  deed <comma> that  tells  you  exactly  what  you  can  do  with  this  content <period> in  fact <comma> you  're  free  to  share  it <comma> to  do  all  of  these  things <comma> to  copy  it <comma> to  change  it <comma> even  to  make  commercial  use  of  it  as  long  as  you  attribute  the  author <period> because  in  academic  publishing  and  much  of  educational  publishing <comma> it  's  really  this  idea  of  sharing  knowledge  and  making  impact  that  's  why  people  write <comma> not  necessarily  making  bucks <period> we  're  not  talking  about  harry  potter <comma> right <questionmark> we  're  at  the  long  tail  end  here <period> behind  that  is  the  legal  code <comma> so  if  you  want  to  very  carefully  construct  it <comma> and  creative  commons  is  taking  off  -- <period> over  43  million  things  out  there <comma> licensed  with  a  creative  commons  license <period> not  just  text <comma> but  music <comma> images <comma> video <comma> and  there  's  actually  a  tremendous  uptake  of  the  number  of  people  that  are  actually  licensing  music  to  make  it  free  for  people  who  do  this  whole  idea  of  re-sampling <comma> rip <comma> mixing <comma> burning  and  sharing <period> so  i'd  like  to  conclude  with  just  the  last  few  points <period> so <comma> we've  built  this  idea  of  a  commons <period> people  are  using  it <period> we  get  over  500,000  unique  visitors  per  month <comma> just  to  our  particular  site <period> mit  open  courseware <comma> which  is  another  large  open-content  site <comma> gets  a  similar  number  of  hits <comma> but  how  do  we  protect  this <questionmark> how  do  we  protect  it  into  the  future <questionmark> and  the  first  thing  that  people  are  probably  thinking  is  quality  control <comma> right <questionmark> because  we  're  saying  that  anybody  can  contribute  things  to  this  commons <period> anybody  can  contribute  anything <period> so  that  could  be  a  problem <period> it  did  n't  take  long  until  people  started  contributing  materials <comma> for  example <comma> on  lingerie <comma> which  is  actually  a  pretty  good  module <period> the  only  problem  is  it  's  plagiarized  from  a  major  french  feminist  journal <comma> and  when  you  go  to  the  supposed  course  website <comma> it  points  to  a  lingerie-selling  website <period> this  is  a  little  bit  of  a  problem <comma> so  we  clearly  need  some  kind  of  idea  of  quality  control <comma> and  this  is  really  where  the  idea  of  review  and  peer  review  comes  in <period> ok <comma> you  come  to  ted <period> why  do  you  come  to  ted <questionmark> because  chris  and  his  team  have  ensured  that  things  are  very <comma> very  high  quality <comma> right <comma> and  so  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  the  same  thing <period> and  we  need  to  be  able  to  design  structures  and  what  we  're  doing  is  designing  social  software  to  enable  anyone  to  build  their  own  peer  review  process <comma> and  we  call  these  things  lenses  and  basically  what  they  allow  is  anyone  out  there  to  develop  their  own  peer  review  process <comma> so  that  they  can  focus  on  the  content  in  the  repository  that  they  think  is  really  important  and  you  can  think  of  ted  as  a  potential  lens <period> so  i'd  just  like  to  end  by  saying <comma> you  can  really  view  this  as  a  call  to  action <period> connexions  and  open  content  is  all  about  sharing  knowledge <period> all  of  you  here  are  tremendously  imbued  with  tremendous  amounts  of  knowledge  and  what  i'd  like  to  do  is  invite  each  and  every  one  of  you  to  contribute  to  this  project  and  other  projects  of  its  type <comma> because  i  think  together  we  can  truly  change  the  landscape  of  education  and  educational  publishing <period> so <comma> thanks  very  much <period> in  october  2010 <comma> the  justice  league  of  america  will  be  teaming  up  with  the  99 <period> icons  like  batman <comma> superman <comma> wonder  woman  and  their  colleagues  will  be  teaming  up  with  icons  jabbar <comma> noora <comma> jami  and  their  colleagues <period> it  's  a  story  of  intercultural  intersections <period> and  what  better  group  to  have  this  conversation  than  those  that  grew  out  of  fighting  fascism  in  their  respective  histories  and  geographies <questionmark> as  fascism  took  over  europe  in  the  1930s <comma> an  unlikely  reaction  came  out  of  north  america <period> as  christian  iconography  got  changed <comma> and  swastikas  were  created  out  of  crucifixes <comma> batman  and  superman  were  created  by  jewish  young  men  in  the  united  states  and  canada <comma> also  going  back  to  the  bible <period> consider  this <comma> like  the  prophets <comma> all  the  superheroes  are  missing  parents <period> superman  's  parents  die  on  krypton  before  the  age  of  one <period> bruce  wayne <comma> who  becomes  batman <comma> loses  his  parents  at  the  age  of  six  in  gotham  city <period> spiderman  is  raised  by  his  aunt  and  uncle <period> and  all  of  them <comma> just  like  the  prophets  who  get  their  message  from  god  through  gabriel <comma> get  their  message  from  above <period> peter  parker  is  in  a  library  in  manhattan  when  the  spider  descends  from  above  and  gives  him  his  message  through  a  bite <period> bruce  wayne  is  in  his  bedroom  when  a  big  bat  flies  over  his  head <comma> and  he  sees  it  as  an  omen  to  become  batman <period> superman  is  not  only  sent  to  earth  from  the  heavens <comma> or  krypton <comma> but  he  's  sent  in  a  pod <comma> much  like  moses  was  on  the  nile <period> and  you  hear  the  voice  of  his  father <comma> jor-el <comma> saying  to  earth <comma> i  have  sent  to  you  my  only  son  these  are  clearly  biblical  archetypes <comma> and  the  thinking  behind  that  was  to  create  positive <comma> globally-resonating  storylines  that  could  be  tied  to  the  same  things  that  other  people  were  pulling  mean  messages  out  of <period> because  then  the  person  that  's  using  religion  for  the  wrong  purpose  just  becomes  a  bad  man  with  a  bad  message <period> and  it  's  only  by  linking  positive  things  that  the  negative  can  be  delinked <period> this  is  the  kind  of  thinking  that  went  into  creating  the  99 <period> the  99  references  the  99  attributes  of  allah  in  the  koran <comma> things  like  generosity  and  mercy  and  foresight  and  wisdom  and  dozens  of  others  that  no  two  people  in  the  world  would  disagree  about <period> it  does  n't  matter  what  your  religion  is <period> even  if  you  're  an  atheist <comma> you  do  n't  raise  your  kid  telling  him <comma> you  know <comma> make  sure  you  lie  three  times  a  day <period> those  are  basic  human  values <period> and  so  the  backstory  of  the  99  takes  place  in  1258 <comma> which  history  tells  us  the  mongols  invaded  baghdad  and  destroyed  it <period> all  the  books  from  bait  al-hikma  library <comma> the  most  famous  library  in  its  day <comma> were  thrown  in  the  tigris  river <comma> and  the  tigris  changes  color  with  ink <period> it  's  a  story  passed  on  generation  after  generation <period> i  rewrote  that  story <period> and  in  my  version <comma> the  librarians  find  out  that  this  is  going  to  happen <comma> and  here  's  a  side  note <comma> if  you  want  a  comic  book  to  do  well <comma> make  the  librarians  the  hero <period> it  always  works  well <period> so  the  librarians  find  out  and  they  get  together  a  special  solution <comma> a  chemical  solution  called  king  's  water <comma> that  when  mixed  with  99  stones  would  be  able  to  save  all  that  culture  and  history  in  the  books <period> but  the  mongols  get  there  first <period> the  books  and  the  solution  get  thrown  in  the  tigris  river <period> some  librarians  escape <comma> and  over  the  course  of  days  and  weeks <comma> they  dip  the  stones  into  the  tigris  and  suck  up  that  collective  wisdom  that  we  all  think  is  lost  to  civilization <period> those  stones  have  been  smuggled  as  three  prayer  beads  of  33  stones  each  through  arabia  into  andalusia  in  spain <comma> where  they  're  safe  for  200  years <period> but  in  1492 <comma> two  important  things  happen <period> the  first  is  the  fall  of  granada <comma> the  last  muslim  enclave  in  europe <period> the  second  is  columbus  finally  gets  funded  to  go  to  india <comma> but  he  gets  lost <period> so  33  of  the  stones  are  smuggled  onto  the  nina <comma> the  pinta  and  the  santa  maria  and  are  spread  in  the  new  world <period> thirty-three  go  on  the  silk  road  to  china <comma> south  asia  and  southeast  asia <period> and  33  are  spread  between  europe <comma> the  middle  east  and  africa <period> and  now  it  's  2010 <comma> and  there  are  99  heroes  from  99  different  countries <period> now  it  's  very  easy  to  assume  that  those  books <comma> because  they  were  from  a  library  called  bait  al-hikma <comma> were  muslim  books <comma> but  that  's  not  the  case  because  the  caliph  that  built  that  library <comma> his  name  was  al-ma  'mun <comma> he  was  harun  al-rashid  's  son <period> he  had  told  his  advisers <comma> get  me  all  the  scholars  to  translate  any  book  they  can  get  their  hands  onto  into  arabic <comma> and  i  will  pay  them  its  weight  in  gold  after  a  while <comma> his  advisers  complained <period> they  said <comma> your  highness <comma> the  scholars  are  cheating <period> they  're  writing  in  big  handwriting  to  take  more  gold  to  which  he  said <comma> let  them  be <comma> because  what  they  're  giving  us  is  worth  a  lot  more  than  what  we  're  paying  them  so  the  idea  of  an  open  architecture <comma> an  open  knowledge <comma> is  not  new  to  my  neck  of  the  desert <period> the  concept  centers  on  something  called  the  noor  stones <period> noor  is  arabic  for  light <period> so  these  99  stones <comma> a  few  kind  of  rules  in  the  game <comma> number  one <comma> you  do  n't  choose  the  stone <period> the  stone  chooses  you <period> there  's  a  king  arthur  element  to  the  storyline <comma> okay <period> number  two <comma> all  of  the  99 <comma> when  they  first  get  their  stone <comma> or  their  power <comma> abuse  it <period> they  use  it  for  self-interest <period> and  there  's  a  very  strong  message  in  there  that  when  you  start  abusing  your  stone <comma> you  get  taken  advantage  of  by  people  who  will  exploit  your  powers <comma> okay <period> number  three <comma> the  99  stones  all  have  within  them  a  mechanism  that  self-updates <period> now  there  are  two  groups  that  exist  within  the  muslim  world <period> everybody  believes  the  koran  is  for  all  time  and  all  place <period> some  believe  that  means  that  the  original  interpretation  from  a  couple  thousand  years  ago  is  what  's  relevant  today <period> i  do  n't  belong  there <period> then  there  's  a  group  that  believes  the  koran  is  a  living <comma> breathing  document <period> and  i  captured  that  idea  within  these  stones  that  self-update <period> now  the  main  bad  guy <comma> rughal <comma> does  not  want  these  stones  to  update <period> so  he  's  trying  to  get  them  to  stop  updating <period> he  cannot  use  the  stones <comma> but  he  can  stop  them <period> and  by  stopping  them <comma> he  has  more  of  a  fascist  agenda <comma> where  he  gets  some  of  the  99  to  work  for  him  -- <period> they  're  all  wearing  cookie-cutter <comma> same  color  uniforms <period> they  're  not  allowed  to  individually  express  who  they  are  and  what  they  are <period> and  he  controls  them  from  the  top  down  -- <period> whereas  when  they  work  for  the  other  side <comma> eventually <comma> when  they  find  out  this  is  the  wrong  person <comma> they've  been  manipulated <comma> they  actually <comma> each  one  has  a  different <comma> colorful  kind  of  dress <period> and  the  last  point  about  the  99  noor  stones  is  this <period> so  the  99  work  in  teams  of  three <period> why  three <questionmark> a  couple  of  reasons <period> number  one <comma> we  have  a  thing  within  islam  that  you  do  n't  leave  a  boy  and  a  girl  alone  together <comma> because  the  third  person  is  temptation  or  the  devil <comma> right <questionmark> i  think  that  's  there  in  all  cultures <comma> right <questionmark> but  this  is  not  about  religion <comma> it  's  not  about  proselytizing <period> there  's  this  very  strong  social  message  that  needs  to  get  to  kind  of  the  deepest  crevices  of  intolerance <period> and  the  only  way  to  get  there  is  to  kind  of  play  the  game <period> and  so  this  is  the  way  i  dealt  with  it <period> they  work  in  teams  of  three <comma> two  boys  and  a  girl <comma> two  girls  and  a  boy <comma> three  boys <comma> three  girls <comma> no  problem <period> and  the  swiss  psychoanalyst <comma> carl  jung <comma> also  spoke  about  the  importance  of  the  number  three  in  all  cultures <comma> so  i  figure  i  'm  covered <period> well <period> i  got  accused  in  a  few  blogs  that  i  was  actually  sent  by  the  pope  to  preach  the  trinity  and  catholicism  in  the  middle  east <comma> so  you <comma> you  believe  who  you  want <period> i  gave  you  my  version  of  the  story <period> so  here  's  some  of  the  characters  that  we  have <period> mujiba <comma> from  malaysia <comma> her  main  power  is  she  's  able  to  answer  any  question <period> she  's  the  trivial  pursuit  queen <comma> if  you  want <period> but  when  she  first  gets  her  power <comma> she  starts  going  on  game  shows  and  making  money <period> we  have  jabbar  from  saudi  who  starts  breaking  things  when  he  has  the  power <period> now <comma> mumita  was  a  fun  one  to  name <period> mumita  is  the  destroyer <period> so  the  99  attributes  of  allah  have  the  yin  and  the  yang <period> there  's  the  powerful <comma> the  hegemonous <comma> the  strong <period> and  there  's  also  the  kind <comma> the  generous <period> i  'm  like <comma> are  all  the  girls  going  to  be  kind  and  merciful  and  the  guys  all  strong <questionmark> i  'm  like <comma> you  know  what <comma> i've  met  a  few  girls  who  were  destroyers  in  my  lifetime <comma> so <period> we  have  jami  from  hungary <comma> who  first  starts  making  weapons: <period> he  's  the  technology  wiz <period> musawwira  from  ghana <comma> hadya  from  pakistan <comma> jaleel  from  iran  who  uses  fire <period> and  this  is  one  of  my  favorites <comma> al-batina  from  yemen <period> al-batina  is  the  hidden <period> so  al-batina  is  hidden <comma> but  she  's  a  superhero <period> i  came  home  to  my  wife  and  i  said <comma> i  created  a  character  after  you <period> my  wife  is  a  saudi  from  yemeni  roots <period> and  she  said <comma> show  me  so  i  showed  this <period> she  said <comma> that  's  not  me <period> i  said <comma> look  at  the  eyes <period> they  're  your  eyes <period> so  i  promised  my  investors  this  would  not  be  another  made-in-fifth-world-country  production <period> this  was  going  to  be  superman <comma> or  it  was  n't  worth  my  time  or  their  money <period> so  from  day  one <comma> the  people  involved  in  the  project <comma> bottom  left  is  fabian  nicieza <comma> writer  for  x-men  and  power  rangers <period> next  to  him  is  dan  panosian <comma> one  of  the  character  creators  for  the  modern-day  x-men <period> top  right  is  stuart  moore <comma> a  writer  for  iron  man <period> next  to  him  is  john  mccrea <comma> who  was  an  inker  for  spiderman <period> and  we  entered  western  consciousness  with  a  tagline <comma> next  ramadan <comma> the  world  will  have  new  heroes <comma> back  in  2005 <period> now  i  went  to  dubai <comma> to  an  arab  thought  foundation  conference <comma> and  i  was  waiting  by  the  coffee  for  the  right  journalist <period> did  n't  have  a  product <comma> but  had  energy <period> and  i  found  somebody  from  the  new  york  times <period> and  i  cornered  him <comma> and  i  pitched  him <period> and  i  think  i  scared  him <comma> because  he  basically  promised  me <comma> we  had  no  product <comma> but  he  said <comma> we  'll  give  you  a  paragraph  in  the  arts  section  if  you  'll  just  go  away <period> so  i  said <comma> great  so  i  called  him  up  a  few  weeks  afterward <period> i  said <comma> hi <comma> hesa  and  he  said <comma> hi  i  said <comma> happy  new  year <period> he  said <comma> thank  you <period> we  had  a  baby  i  said <comma> congratulations <period> like  i  care <comma> right <questionmark> so  when  's  the  article  coming  out <questionmark> he  said <comma> naif <comma> islam  and  cartoon <questionmark> that  's  not  timely <period> you  know <comma> maybe  next  week <comma> next  month <comma> next  year <comma> but <comma> you  know <comma> it  'll  come  out  so  a  few  days  after  that <comma> what  happens <questionmark> what  happens  is  the  world  erupts  in  the  danish  cartoon  controversy <period> i  became  timely <period> so  flurry  of  phone  calls  and  emails  from  the  new  york  times <period> next  thing  you  knew <comma> there  's  a  full  page  covering  us  positively <comma> january  22nd <comma> 2006 <comma> which  changed  our  lives  forever <period> because  anybody  googling  islam  and  cartoon  or  islam  and  comic <comma> guess  what  they  got <period> they  got  me <period> and  the  99  were  like  superheroes  kind  of  flying  out  of  what  was  happening  around  the  world <period> and  that  led  to  all  kinds  of  things <comma> from  being  in  curricula  in  universities  and  schools  to <comma> one  of  my  favorite  pictures  i  have  from  south  asia <comma> it  was  a  couple  of  men  with  long  beards  and  a  lot  of  girls  wearing  the  hijab <comma> it  looked  like  a  school <period> the  good  news  is  they  're  all  holding  copies  of  the  99 <comma> smiling <comma> and  they  found  me  to  sign  the  picture <period> the  bad  news  is  they  were  all  photocopies <comma> so  we  did  n't  make  a  dime  in  revenue <period> we've  been  able  to  license  the  99  comic  books  into  eight  languages  so  far <comma> chinese <comma> indonesian <comma> hindi <comma> urdu <comma> turkish <period> opened  a  theme  park  through  a  license  in  kuwait  a  year  and  a  half  ago  called  the  99  village  theme  park <comma> 300,000  square  feet <comma> 20  rides <comma> all  with  our  characters: <period> a  couple  back-to-school  licenses  in  spain  and  turkey <period> but  the  biggest  thing  we've  done  to  date <comma> which  is  just  amazing <comma> is  that  we've  done  a  26-episode  animated  series <comma> which  is  done  for  global  audiences <comma> in  fact <comma> we  're  already  going  to  be  in  the  us <period> and  turkey <comma> we  know <period> it  's  3d  cgi <comma> which  is  going  to  be  very  high-quality <comma> written  in  hollywood  by  the  writers  behind  ben  10  and  spiderman  and  star  wars <comma> clone  wars <period> in  this  clip  i  'm  about  to  show  you <comma> which  has  never  been  seen  in  the  public  before <comma> there  is  a  struggle <period> two  of  the  characters <comma> jabbar <comma> the  one  with  the  muscles <comma> and  noora <comma> the  one  that  can  use  light <comma> are  actually  wearing  the  cookie-cutter  fascist  gray  uniform  because  they  're  being  manipulated <period> they  do  n't  know <comma> ok <period> and  they  're  trying  to  get  another  member  of  the  99  to  join  them <period> so  there  's  a  struggle  within  the  team <period> so  if  we  can  get  the  lights <period> the  99  jabbar <comma> dana <comma> i  cannot  see  where  to  grab  hold <period> i  need  more  light <period> what  's  happening <questionmark> dana <comma> there  's  too  much  darkness <period> rughal <comma> there  must  be  something  we  can  do <period> man <comma> i  wo  n't  send  any  more  commandos  in  until  i  know  it  's  safe <period> dr.  razem <comma> it  's  time  to  go <comma> miklos <period> miklos <comma> must  download  file  contents <period> i  cannot  forget  auntie <period> jabbar <comma> dana <comma> i  cannot  do  this  without  you <period> dana <comma> but  i  cannot  help <period> jabbar <comma> you  can <comma> even  if  you  do  n't  believe  in  yourself  right  now <period> i  believe  in  you <period> you  are  noora  the  light <period> dana <comma> no <period> i  do  n't  deserve  it <period> i  do  n't  deserve  anything <period> jabbar <comma> then  what  about  the  rest  of  us <questionmark> do  n't  we  deserve  to  be  saved <questionmark> do  n't  i <questionmark> now <comma> tell  me  which  way  to  go <period> dana <comma> that  way <period> alarm <comma> threat  imminent <period> jabbar <comma> aaaahhh <period> miklos <comma> stay  away  from  me <period> jabbar <comma> we  're  here  to  help  you <period> dr.  razem <comma> do  n't  listen  to  them <period> dana <comma> miklos <comma> that  man  is  not  your  friend <period> miklos <comma> no <period> he  gave  me  access <comma> and  you  want  to  reboot  the  unclear <period> no  more  unclear <period> the  99  thank  you <period> so  the  99  is  technology <period> it  's  entertainment <period> it  's  design <period> but  that  's  only  half  the  story <period> as  the  father  of  five  sons <comma> i  worry  about  who  they  're  going  to  be  using  as  role  models <period> i  worry  because  all  around  me <comma> even  within  my  extended  family <comma> i  see  religion  being  manipulated <period> as  a  psychologist <comma> i  worry  for  the  world  in  general <comma> but  worry  about  the  perception  of  how  people  see  themselves  in  my  part  of  the  world <period> now <comma> i  'm  a  clinical  psychologist <period> i  'm  licensed  in  new  york  state <period> i  trained  at  bellevue  hospital  survivors  of  political  torture  program <period> and  i  heard  one  too  many  stories  of  people  growing  up  to  idolize  their  leadership <comma> only  to  end  up  being  tortured  by  their  heroes <period> and  torture  's  a  terrible  enough  thing  as  it  is <comma> but  when  it  's  done  by  your  hero <comma> that  just  breaks  you  in  so  many  ways <period> i  left  bellevue <comma> went  to  business  school  and  started  this <period> now <comma> one  of  the  things  that  i  refer  to  when  i <comma> about  the  importance  of  this  message <comma> is  that  i  gave  a  lecture  at  the  medical  school  at  kuwait  university <comma> where  i  lecture  on  the  biological  basis  of  behavior <comma> and  i  gave  the  students  two  articles <comma> one  from  the  new  york  times  and  one  from  new  york  magazine <period> and  i  took  away  the  name  of  the  writer <comma> the  name  of  the  unclear <comma> everything  was  gone  except  the  facts <period> and  the  first  one  was  about  a  group  called  the  party  of  god <comma> who  wanted  to  ban  valentine  's  day <period> red  was  made  illegal <period> any  boys  and  girls  caught  flirting  would  get  married  off  immediately <comma> okay <period> the  second  one  was  about  a  woman  complaining  because  three  minivans  with  six  bearded  men  pulled  up  and  started  interrogating  her  on  the  spot  for  talking  to  a  man  who  was  n't  related  to  her <period> and  i  asked  the  students  in  kuwait  where  they  thought  these  incidents  took  place <period> the  first  one <comma> they  said  saudi  arabia <period> there  was  no  debate <period> the  second  one <comma> they  were  actually  split  between  saudi  and  afghanistan <period> what  blew  their  mind  was  the  first  one  took  place  in  india <comma> it  was  the  party  of  a  hindu  god <period> the  second  one  took  place  in  upstate  new  york <period> it  was  an  orthodox  jewish  community <period> but  what  breaks  my  heart  and  what  's  alarming  is  that  in  those  two  interviews <comma> the  people  around <comma> who  were  interviewed  as  well <comma> refer  to  that  behavior  as  talibanization <period> in  other  words <comma> good  hindus  and  good  jews  do  n't  act  this  way <period> this  is  islam  's  influence  on  hinduism  and  judaism <period> but  what  do  the  students  in  kuwait  say <questionmark> they  said  it  's  us  -- <period> and  this  is  dangerous <period> it  's  dangerous  when  a  group  self-identifies  itself  as  extreme <period> this  is  one  of  my  sons <comma> rayan <comma> who  's  a  scooby  doo  addict <period> you  can  tell  by  the  glasses  there <period> he  actually  called  me  a  meddling  kid  the  other  day <period> but  i  borrow  a  lesson  that  i  learned  from  him <period> last  summer  when  we  were  in  our  home  in  new  york <comma> he  was  out  in  the  yard  playing  in  his  playhouse <period> and  i  was  in  my  office  working <comma> and  he  came  in <comma> baba <comma> i  want  you  to  come  with  me <period> i  want  my  toy <period> yes <comma> rayan <comma> just  go  away  he  left  his  scooby  doo  in  his  house <period> i  said <comma> go  away <period> i  'm  working <period> i  'm  busy <period> and  what  rayan  did  then  is  he  sat  there <comma> he  tapped  his  foot  on  the  floor <comma> at  three  and  a  half <comma> and  he  looked  at  me  and  he  said <comma> baba <comma> i  want  you  to  come  with  me  to  my  office  in  my  house <period> i  have  work  to  do <period> rayan  reframed  the  situation  and  brought  himself  down  to  my  level <period> and  with  the  99 <comma> that  is  what  we  aim  to  do <period> you  know <comma> i  think  that  there  's  a  big  parallel  between  bending  the  crucifix  out  of  shape  and  creating  swastikas <period> and  when  i  see  pictures  like  this <comma> of  parents  or  uncles  who  think  it  's  cute  to  have  a  little  child  holding  a  koran  and  having  a  suicide  bomber  belt  around  them  to  protest  something <comma> the  hope  is  by  linking  enough  positive  things  to  the  koran <comma> that  one  day  we  can  move  this  child  from  being  proud  in  the  way  they  're  proud  there <comma> to  that <period> and  i  think <comma> i  think  the  99  can  and  will  achieve  its  mission <period> as  an  undergrad  at  tufts  university <comma> we  were  giving  away  free  falafel  one  day  and <comma> you  know <comma> it  was  middle  east  day  or  something <period> and  people  came  up  and  picked  up  the  culturally  resonant  image  of  the  falafel <comma> ate  it  and <comma> you  know <comma> talked  and  left <period> and  no  two  people  could  disagree  about  what  the  word  free  was  and  what  the  word  falafel  was <comma> behind  us <comma> free  falafel  you  know <period> or  so  we  thought <comma> until  a  woman  came  rushing  across  the  campus  and  dropped  her  bag  on  the  floor <comma> pointed  up  to  the  sign  and  said <comma> who  's  falafel <questionmark> true  story <period> she  was  actually  coming  out  of  an  amnesty  international  meeting <period> just  today <comma> dc <period> comics  announced  the  cover  of  our  upcoming  crossover <period> on  that  cover  you  see  batman <comma> superman  and  a  fully-clothed  wonder  woman  with  our  saudi  member  of  the  99 <comma> our  emirati  member  and  our  libyan  member <period> on  april  26 <comma> 2010 <comma> president  barack  obama  said  that  of  all  the  initiatives  since  his  now  famous  cairo  speech <comma> in  which  he  reached  out  to  the  muslim  world <comma> the  most  innovative  was  that  the  99  reach  back  out  to  the  justice  league  of  america <period> we  live  in  a  world  in  which  the  most  culturally  innocuous  symbols <comma> like  the  falafel <comma> can  be  misunderstood  because  of  baggage <comma> and  where  religion  can  be  twisted  and  purposefully  made  where  it  's  not  supposed  to  be  by  others <period> in  a  world  like  that <comma> they  'll  always  be  a  job  for  superman  and  the  99 <period> thank  you  very  much <period> my  name  is  lovegrove <period> i  only  know  nine  lovegroves <comma> two  of  which  are  my  parents <period> they  are  first  cousins <comma> and  you  know  what  happens  when <comma> you  know <comma> so  there  's  a  terribly  weird  freaky  side  to  me <comma> which  i  'm  fighting  with  all  the  time <period> so  to  try  and  get  through  today <comma> i've  kind  of  disciplined  myself  with  an  18-minute  talk <period> i  was  hanging  on  to  have  a  pee <period> i  thought  perhaps  if  i  was  hanging  on  long  enough <comma> that  would  guide  me  through  the  18  minutes <period> okay <period> i  am  known  as  captain  organic <comma> and  that  's  a  philosophical  position  as  well  as  an  aesthetic  position <period> but  today  what  i'd  like  to  talk  to  you  about  is  that  love  of  form  and  how  form  can  touch  people  's  soul  and  emotion <period> not  very  long  ago <comma> not  many  thousands  of  years  ago <comma> we  actually  lived  in  caves <comma> and  i  do  n't  think  we've  lost  that  coding  system <period> we  respond  so  well  to  form <comma> but  i  'm  interested  in  creating  intelligent  form <period> i  'm  not  interested  at  all  in  blobism  or  any  of  that  superficial  rubbish  that  you  see  coming  out  as  design <period> these <comma> this  artificially  induced  consumerism <comma> i  think  it  's  atrocious <period> my  world  is  the  world  of  people  like  amory  lovins <comma> janine  benyus <comma> james  watson <period> i  'm  in  that  world <comma> but  i  work  purely  instinctively <period> i  'm  not  a  scientist <period> i  could  have  been <comma> perhaps <comma> but  i  work  in  this  world  where  i  trust  my  instincts <period> so  i  am  a  21st-century  translator  of  technology  into  products  that  we  use  everyday  and  relate  beautifully  and  naturally  with <period> and  we  should  be  developing  things <comma> we  should  be  developing  packaging  for  ideas  which  elevate  people  's  perceptions  and  respect  for  the  things  that  we  dig  out  of  the  earth  and  translate  into  products  for  everyday  use <period> so <comma> the  water  bottle <period> i  'll  begin  with  this  concept  of  what  i  call  dna <period> dna <comma> design <comma> nature <comma> art <period> these  are  the  three  things  that  condition  my  world <period> here  is  a  drawing  by  leonardo  da  vinci <comma> 500  years  ago <comma> before  photography <period> it  shows  how  observation <comma> curiosity  and  instinct  work  to  create  amazing  art <period> industrial  design  is  the  art  form  of  the  21st  century <period> people  like  leonardo <comma> there  have  not  been  many <comma> had  this  amazingly  instinctive  curiosity <period> i  work  from  a  similar  position <period> i  do  n't  want  to  sound  pretentious  saying  that <comma> but  this  is  my  drawing  made  on  a  digital  pad  a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> well  into  the  21st  century <comma> 500  years  later <period> it  's  my  impression  of  water <period> impressionism  being  the  most  valuable  art  form  on  the  planet  as  we  know  it <comma> 100  million  dollars <comma> easily <comma> for  a  monet <period> i  use <comma> now <comma> a  whole  new  process <period> a  few  years  ago  i  reinvented  my  process  to  keep  up  with  people  like  greg  lynn <comma> tom  main <comma> zaha  hadid <comma> rem  koolhaas <comma> all  these  people  that  i  think  are  persevering  and  pioneering  with  fantastic  new  ideas  of  how  to  create  form <period> this  is  all  created  digitally <period> here  you  see  the  machining <comma> the  milling  of  a  block  of  acrylic <period> this  is  what  i  show  to  the  client  to  say <comma> that  's  what  i  want  to  do <period> at  that  point <comma> i  do  n't  know  if  that  's  possible  at  all <period> it  's  a  seductor <comma> but  i  just  feel  in  my  bones  that  that  's  possible <period> so  we  go <period> we  look  at  the  tooling <period> we  look  at  how  that  is  produced <period> these  are  the  invisible  things  that  you  never  see  in  your  life <period> this  is  the  background  noise  of  industrial  design <period> that  is  like  an  anish  kapoor  flowing  through  a  richard  serra <period> it  is  more  valuable  than  the  product  in  my  eyes <period> i  do  n't  have  one <period> when  i  do  make  some  money <comma> i  'll  have  one  machined  for  myself <period> this  is  the  final  product <period> when  they  sent  it  to  me <comma> i  thought  i'd  failed <period> it  felt  like  nothing <period> it  has  to  feel  like  nothing <period> it  was  when  i  put  the  water  in  that  i  realized  that  i'd  put  a  skin  on  water  itself <period> it  's  an  icon  of  water  itself <comma> and  it  elevates  people  's  perception  of  contemporary  design <period> each  bottle  is  different <comma> meaning  the  water  level  will  give  you  a  different  shape <period> it  's  mass  individualism  from  a  single  product <period> it  fits  the  hand <period> it  fits  arthritic  hands <period> it  fits  children  's  hands <period> it  makes  the  product  strong <comma> the  tessellation <period> it  's  a  millefiori  of  ideas <period> in  the  future  they  will  look  like  that <comma> because  we  need  to  move  away  from  those  type  of  polymers  and  use  that  for  medical  equipment  and  more  important  things <comma> perhaps <comma> in  life <period> biopolymers <comma> these  new  ideas  for  materials <comma> will  come  into  play  in  probably  a  decade <period> it  does  n't  look  as  cool <comma> does  it <questionmark> but  i  can  live  up  to  that <period> i  do  n't  have  a  problem  with  that <period> i  design  for  that  condition <comma> biopolymers <period> it  's  the  future <period> i  took  this  video  in  cape  town  last  year <period> this  is  the  freaky  side  coming  out <period> i  have  this  special  interest  in  things  like  this  which  blow  my  mind <period> i  do  n't  know  whether  to <comma> you  know <comma> drop  to  my  knees <comma> cry <period> i  do  n't  know  what  i  think <period> but  i  just  know  that  nature  improves  with  ever-greater  purpose  that  which  once  existed <comma> and  that  strangeness  is  a  consequence  of  innovative  thinking <period> when  i  look  at  these  things <comma> they  look  pretty  normal  to  me <period> but  these  things  evolved  over  many  years <comma> and  now  what  we  're  trying  to  do <comma> i  get  three  weeks  to  design  a  telephone <period> how  the  hell  do  i  do  a  telephone  in  three  weeks <comma> when  you  get  these  things  that  take  hundreds  of  million  years  to  evolve <questionmark> how  do  you  condense  that <questionmark> it  comes  back  to  instinct <period> i  'm  not  talking  about  designing  telephones  that  look  like  that <comma> and  i  'm  not  looking  at  designing  architecture  like  that <period> i  'm  just  interested  in  natural  growth  patterns <comma> and  the  beautiful  forms  that  only  nature  really  creates <period> how  that  flows  through  me  and  how  that  comes  out  is  what  i  'm  trying  to  understand <period> this  is  a  scan  through  the  human  forearm <period> it  's  then  blown  up  through  rapid  prototyping  to  reveal  the  cellular  structure <period> i  have  these  in  my  office <period> my  office  is  a  mixture  of  the  natural  history  museum  and  a  nasa  space  lab <period> it  's  a  weird <comma> kind  of  freaky  place <period> this  is  one  of  my  specimens <period> this  is  made <comma> bone  is  made  from  a  mixture  of  inorganic  minerals  and  polymers <period> i  studied  cooking  in  school  for  four  years <comma> and  in  that  experience <comma> which  was  called  domestic  science <comma> it  was  a  bit  of  a  cheap  trick  for  me  to  try  and  get  a  science  qualification <period> actually <comma> i  put  marijuana  in  everything  i  cooked <comma> and  i  had  access  to  all  the  best  girls <period> it  was  fabulous <period> all  the  guys  in  the  rugby  team  could  n't  understand <comma> but  anyway <comma> this  is  a  meringue <period> this  is  another  sample  i  have <period> a  meringue  is  made  exactly  the  same  way <comma> in  my  estimation <comma> as  a  bone <period> it  's  made  from  polysaccharides  and  proteins <period> if  you  pour  water  on  that <comma> it  dissolves <period> could  we  be  manufacturing  from  foodstuffs  in  the  future <questionmark> not  a  bad  idea <period> i  do  n't  know <period> i  need  to  talk  to  janine  and  a  few  other  people  about  that <comma> but  i  believe  instinctively  that  that  meringue  can  become  something <comma> a  car <comma> i  do  n't  know <period> i  'm  also  interested  in  growth  patterns <comma> the  unbridled  way  that  nature  grows  things  so  you  're  not  restricted  by  form  at  all <period> these  interrelated  forms <comma> they  do  inspire  everything  i  do  although  i  might  end  up  making  something  incredibly  simple <period> this  is  a  detail  of  a  chair  that  i've  designed  in  magnesium <period> it  shows  this  interlocution  of  elements  and  the  beauty  of  kind  of  engineering  and  biological  thinking <comma> shown  pretty  much  as  a  bone  structure <period> any  one  of  those  elements  you  could  sort  of  hang  on  the  wall  as  some  kind  of  art  object <period> it  's  the  world  's  first  chair  made  in  magnesium <period> it  cost  17  million  dollars  to  develop <period> it  's  called  go  by  bernhardt <comma> usa <period> it  went  into  time  magazine  in  2001  as  the  new  language  of  the  21st  century <period> boy <period> for  somebody  growing  up  in  wales  in  a  little  village <comma> that  's  enough <period> it  shows  how  you  make  one  holistic  form <comma> like  the  car  industry <comma> and  then  you  break  up  what  you  need <period> this  is  an  absolutely  beautiful  way  of  working <period> it  's  a  godly  way  of  working <period> it  's  organic  and  it  's  essential <period> it  's  an  absolutely  fat-free  design <comma> and  when  you  look  at  it <comma> you  see  human  beings <period> bless  you <period> when  that  moves  into  polymers <comma> you  can  change  the  elasticity <comma> the  fluidity  of  the  form <period> this  is  an  idea  for  a  gas-injected <comma> one-piece  polymer  chair <period> what  nature  does  is  it  drills  holes  in  things <period> it  liberates  form <period> it  takes  away  anything  extraneous <period> that  's  what  i  do <period> i  make  organic  things  which  are  essential <period> i  do  n't <comma> and  they  look  funky  too <comma> but  i  do  n't  set  out  to  make  funky  things  because  i  think  that  's  an  absolute  disgrace <period> i  set  out  to  look  at  natural  forms <period> if  you  took  the  idea  of  fractal  technology  further <comma> take  a  membrane <comma> shrinking  it  down  constantly  like  nature  does <comma> that  could  be  a  seat  for  a  chair <period> it  could  be  a  sole  for  a  sports  shoe <period> it  could  be  a  car  blending  into  seats <period> wow <period> let  's  go  for  it <period> that  's  the  kind  of  stuff <period> this  is  what  exists  in  nature <period> observation  now  allows  us  to  bring  that  natural  process  into  the  design  process  every  day <period> that  's  what  i  do <period> this  is  a  show  that  's  currently  on  in  tokyo <period> it  's  called  superliquidity  it  's  my  sculptural  investigation <period> it  's  like  21st-century  henry  moore <period> when  you  see  a  henry  moore  still <comma> your  hair  stands  up <period> there  's  some  amazing  spiritual  connect <period> if  he  was  a  car  designer <comma> phew <comma> we'd  all  be  driving  one <period> in  his  day <comma> he  was  the  highest  taxpayer  in  britain <period> that  is  the  power  of  organic  design <period> it  contributes  immensely  to  our  sense  of  being <comma> our  sense  of  relationships  with  things <comma> our  sensuality  and <comma> you  know <comma> the  sort  of <comma> even  the  sort  of  socio-erotic  side <comma> which  is  very  important <period> this  is  my  artwork <period> this  is  all  my  process <period> these  actually  are  sold  as  artwork <period> they  're  very  big  prints <period> but  this  is  how  i  get  to  that  object <period> ironically <comma> that  object  was  made  by  the  killarney  process <comma> which  is  a  brand-new  process  here  for  the  21st  century <comma> and  i  can  hear  greg  lynn  laughing  his  socks  off  as  i  say  that <period> i  'll  tell  you  about  that  later <period> when  i  look  into  these  data  images <comma> i  see  new  things <period> i  'm  self <comma> it  's  self-inspired <period> diatomic  structures <comma> radiolaria <comma> the  things  that  we  could  n't  see  but  we  can  do  now  -- <period> these <comma> again <comma> are  cored  out <period> they  're  made  virtually  from  nothing <period> they  're  made  from  silica <period> why  not  structures  from  cars  like  that <questionmark> coral <comma> all  these  natural  forces <comma> take  away  what  they  do  n't  need  and  they  deliver  maximum  beauty <period> we  need  to  be  in  that  realm <period> i  want  to  do  stuff  like  that <period> this  is  a  new  chair  which  should  come  on  the  market  in  september <period> it  's  for  a  company  called  moroso  in  italy <period> it  's  a  gas-injected  polymer  chair <period> those  holes  you  see  there  are  very  filtered-down <comma> watered-down  versions  of  the  extremity  of  the  diatomic  structures <period> it  goes  with  the  flow  of  the  polymer  and  you  'll  see <comma> there  's  an  image  coming  up  right  now  that  shows  the  full  thing <period> it  's  great  to  have  companies  in  italy  who  support  this  way  of  dreaming <period> if  you  see  the  shadows  that  come  through  that <comma> they  're  actually  probably  more  important  than  the  product <comma> but  it  's  the  minimum  it  takes <period> the  coring  out  of  the  back  lets  you  breathe <period> it  takes  away  any  material  you  do  n't  need  and  it  actually  garners  flexure  too <comma> so <comma> i  was  going  to  break  into  a  dance  then <period> this  is  some  current  work  i  'm  doing <period> i  'm  looking  at  single-surface  structures  and  how  they  flow <comma> how  they  stretch  and  flow <period> it  's  based  on  furniture  typologies <comma> but  that  's  not  the  end  motivation <period> it  's  made  from  aluminum <comma> as  opposed  to  aluminium <comma> and  it  's  grown <period> it  's  grown  in  my  mind <comma> and  then  it  's  grown  in  terms  of  the  whole  process  that  i  go  through <period> this  is  two  weeks  ago  in  ccp  in  coventry <comma> who  build  parts  for  bentleys  and  so  on <period> it  's  being  built  as  we  speak <comma> and  it  will  be  on  show  in  phillips  next  year  in  new  york <period> i  have  a  big  show  with  phillips  auctioneers <period> when  i  see  these  animations <comma> oh  jesus <comma> i  'm  blown  away <period> this  is  what  goes  on  in  my  studio  everyday <period> i  walk <comma> i  'm  traveling <period> i  come  back <period> some  guy  's  got  that  on  a  computer <comma> there  's  this  like <comma> oh  my  goodness <period> so  i  try  to  create  this  energy  of  invention  every  day  in  my  studio <period> this  kind  of  effervescent <comma> fully  charged  sense  of  soup  that  delivers  ideas <period> single-surface  products <period> furniture  's  a  good  one <period> how  you  grow  legs  out  of  a  surface <period> i  would  love  to  build  this  one  day <comma> and  perhaps  i'd  like  to  build  it  also  out  of  flour <comma> sugar <comma> polymer <comma> wood  chips <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> human  hair <period> i  do  n't  know <period> i'd  love  a  go  at  that <period> i  do  n't  know <period> if  i  just  got  some  time <period> that  's  the  weird  side  coming  out  again <comma> and  a  lot  of  companies  do  n't  understand  that <period> three  weeks  ago  i  was  with  sony  in  tokyo <period> they  said <comma> give  us  the  dream <period> what  is  our  dream <questionmark> how  do  we  beat  apple <questionmark> i  said <comma> well  you  do  n't  copy  apple <comma> that  's  for  sure <period> i  said <comma> you  get  into  biopolymers  they  looked  straight  through  me <period> what  a  waste <period> anyway <period> no <comma> it  's  true <period> fuck  em <period> fuck  em <period> you  know <comma> i  mean <period> i  'm  delivering <period> they  're  not  taking <period> i've  had  this  image  20  years <period> i've  had  this  image  of  a  water  droplet  for  20  years  sitting  on  a  hot  bed <period> that  is  an  image  of  a  car  for  me <period> that  's  the  car  of  the  future <period> it  's  a  water  droplet <period> i've  been  banging  on  about  this  like  i  cannot  believe <period> cars  are  all  wrong <period> i  'm  going  to  show  you  something  a  bit  weird  now <period> they  laughed  everywhere  over  the  world  i  showed  this <period> the  only  place  that  did  n't  laugh  was  moscow <period> its  cars  are  made  from  30,000  components <period> how  ridiculous  is  that <questionmark> could  n't  you  make  that  from  300 <questionmark> it  's  got  a  vacuum-formed <comma> carbon-nylon  pan <period> everything  's  holistically  integrated <period> it  opens  and  closes  like  a  bread  bin <period> there  is  no  engine <period> there  's  a  solar  panel  on  the  back <comma> and  there  are  batteries  in  the  wheels <period> they  're  fitted  like  formula  one <period> you  take  them  off  your  wall <period> you  plug  them  in <period> off  you  jolly  well  go <period> a  three-wheeled  car <comma> slow <comma> feminine <comma> transparent <comma> so  you  can  see  the  people  in  there <period> you  drive  different <period> you  see  that  thing <period> you  do <period> you  do  and  not  anaesthetized <comma> separated  from  life <period> there  's  a  hole  at  the  front <comma> and  there  's  a  reason  for  that <period> it  's  a  city  car <period> you  drive  along <period> you  get  out <period> you  drive  on  to  a  proboscis <period> you  get  out <period> it  lifts  you  up <period> it  presents  the  solar  panel  to  the  sun <comma> and  at  night  it  's  a  street  lamp <period> that  's  what  happens  if  you  get  inspired  by  the  street  lamp  first <comma> and  then  do  the  car  second <period> these  bubbles <comma> i  can  see  these  bubbles  with  these  hydrogen  packages <comma> floating  around  on  the  ground  driven  by  ai <period> when  i  showed  this  in  south  africa <comma> everybody  after  was  going <comma> yeah <comma> hey <comma> car  on  a  stick <period> like  this <period> can  you  imagine <questionmark> a  car  on  a  stick <period> if  you  put  it  next  to  contemporary  architecture <comma> it  feels  totally  natural  to  me <period> and  that  's  what  i  do  with  my  furniture <period> i  'm  not  putting  charles  eames  furniture  in  buildings  anymore <period> forget  that <period> we  move  on <period> i  'm  trying  to  build  furniture  that  fits  architecture <period> i  'm  trying  to  build  transportation  systems <period> i  work  on  aircraft  for  airbus <comma> the  whole  thing <comma> i  do  all  this  sort  of  stuff  trying  to  force  these  natural <comma> inspired-by-nature  dreams  home <period> i  'm  going  to  finish  on  two  things <period> this  is  the  steriolithography  of  a  staircase <period> it  's  a  little  bit  of  a  dedication  to  james <comma> james  watson <period> i  built  this  thing  for  my  studio <period> it  cost  me  250,000  dollars  to  build  this <period> most  people  go  and  buy  the  aston  martin <period> i  built  this <period> this  is  the  data  that  goes  with  that <period> incredibly  complex <period> took  about  two  years <comma> because  i  'm  looking  for  fat-free  design <period> lean <comma> efficient  things <period> healthy  products <period> this  is  built  by  composites <period> it  's  a  single  element  which  rotates  around  to  create  a

 in  the  studio <period> this  is  how  it  looks  pretty  much  every  day <period> you  would  n't  want  to  have  a  fear  of  heights  coming  down  it <period> there  is  virtually  no  handrail <period> it  does  n't  pass  any  standards <period> who  cares <questionmark> yeah <comma> and  it  has  an  internal  handrail  which  gives  it  it  's  strength <period> it  's  this  holistic  integration <period> that  's  my  studio <period> it  's  subterranean <period> it  's  in  notting  hill  next  to  all  the  crap <comma> you  know <comma> the  prostitutes  and  all  that  stuff <period> it  's  next  to  david  hockney  's  original  studio <period> it  has  a  lighting  system  that  changes  throughout  the  day <period> my  guys  go  out  for  lunch <period> the  door  's  open <period> they  come  back  in <comma> because  it  's  normally  raining <comma> and  they  prefer  to  stay  in <period> this  is  my  studio <period> elephant  skull  from  oxford  university <comma> 1988 <period> i  bought  that  last  year <period> they  're  very  difficult  to  find <period> i  would <comma> if  anybody  's  got  a  whale  skeleton  they  want  to  sell  me <comma> i  'll  put  it  in  the  studio <period> so  i  'm  just  going  to  interject  a  little  bit  with  some  of  the  things  that  you  'll  see  in  the  video <period> it  's  a  homemade  video <comma> made  it  myself  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning  just  to  show  you  how  my  real  world  is <period> you  never  see  that <period> you  never  see  architects  or  designers  showing  you  their  real  world <period> this  is  called  a  plasnet  it  's  a  bio-polycarbonate  new  chair  i  'm  doing  in  italy <period> world  's  first  bamboo  bike  with  folding  handlebars <period> we  should  all  be  riding  one  of  these <period> as  china  buys  all  these  crappy  cars <comma> we  should  be  riding  things  like  this <period> counterbalance <period> like  i  say <comma> it  's  a  cross  between  natural  history  museum  and  a  nasa  laboratory <period> it  's  full  of  prototypes  and  objects <period> it  's  self-inspirational  again <period> i  mean <comma> the  rare  times  when  i  'm  there <comma> i  do  enjoy  it <period> and  i  get  lots  of  kids  coming <comma> lots  and  lots  of  kids  coming <period> i  'm  a  contaminator  for  all  those  children  of  investment  bankers <comma> wankers <period> this <comma> sorry <comma> that  's  a  solar  seed <period> it  's  a  concept  for  new  architecture <period> that  thing  on  the  top  is  the  world  's  first  solar-powered  garden  lamp <comma> the  first  produced <period> giles  revell  should  be  talking  here  today <comma> amazing  photography  of  things  you  cannot  see <period> the  first  sculptural  model  i  made  for  that  thing  in  tokyo <period> lots  of  stuff <period> there  's  a  little  leaf  chair <comma> that  golden  looking  thing  is  called  leaf  it  's  made  from  kevlar <period> on  the  wall  is  my  book  called  supernatural <comma> which  allows  me  to  remember  what  i've  done <comma> because  i  forget <period> there  's  an  aerated  brick  i  did  in  limoges  last  year <comma> in  concepts  for  new  ceramics  in  architecture <period> unclear <comma> working  at  three  o'clock  in  the  morning <comma> and  i  do  n't  pay  overtime <period> overtime  is  the  passion  of  design <comma> so  join  the  club  or  do  n't <period> no <comma> it  's  true <period> it  's  true <period> people  like  tom  and  greg <comma> we  're  traveling  like  you  cannot <comma> we  fit  it  all  in <period> i  do  n't  know  how  we  do  it <period> next  week  i  'm  at  electrolux  in  sweden <comma> then  i  'm  in  beijing  on  friday <period> you  work  that  one  out <period> and  when  i  see  ed  's  photographs  i  think <comma> why  the  hell  am  i  going  to  china <questionmark> it  's  true <period> it  's  true <period> because  there  's  a  soul  in  this  whole  thing <period> we  need  to  have  a  new  instinct  for  the  21st  century <period> we  need  to  combine  all  this  stuff <period> if  all  the  people  who  were  talking  over  this  period  worked  on  a  car  together <comma> it  would  be  a  joy <comma> absolute  joy <period> so  there  's  a  new  x-light  system  i  'm  doing  in  japan <period> there  's  tuareg  shoes  from  north  africa <period> there  's  a  kifwebe  mask <period> these  are  my  sculptures <period> a  copper  jelly  mold <period> it  sounds  like  some  quiz  show  or  something <comma> does  n't  it <questionmark> so <comma> it  's  going  to  end <period> thank  you <comma> james <comma> for  your  great  inspiration <period> thank  you  very  much <period> well <comma> i  learned  a  lot  of  things  about  ballooning <comma> especially  at  the  end  of  these  balloon  flights  around  the  world  i  did  with  brian  jones <period> when  i  took  this  picture <comma> the  window  was  frozen  because  of  the  moisture  of  the  night <period> and  on  the  other  side  there  was  a  rising  sun <period> so <comma> you  see  that  on  the  other  side  of  ice  you  have  the  unknown <comma> you  have  the  non-obvious <comma> you  have  the  non-seen <comma> for  the  people  who  do  n't  dare  to  go  through  the  ice <period> there  are  so  many  people  who  prefer  to  suffer  in  the  ice  they  know  instead  of  taking  the  risk  of  going  through  the  ice  to  see  what  there  is  on  the  other  side <period> and  i  think  that  's  one  of  the  main  problems  of  our  society <period> we  learn <comma> maybe  not  the  famous  ted  audience <comma> but  so  many  other  people  learn <comma> that  the  unknown <comma> the  doubts <comma> the  question  marks  are  dangerous <period> and  we  have  to  resist  to  the  changes <period> we  have  to  keep  everything  under  control <period> well <comma> the  unknown  is  part  of  life <period> and  in  that  sense <comma> ballooning  is  a  beautiful  metaphor <period> because  in  the  balloon <comma> like  in  life <comma> we  go  very  well  in  unforeseen  directions <period> we  want  to  go  in  a  direction <comma> but  the  winds  push  us  in  another  direction <comma> like  in  life <period> and  as  long  as  we  fight  horizontally <comma> against  life <comma> against  the  winds <comma> against  what  's  happening  to  us <comma> life  is  a  nightmare <period> how  do  we  steer  a  balloon <questionmark> by  understanding  that  the  atmosphere  is  made  out  of  several  different  layers  of  wind  which  all  have  different  direction <period> so <comma> then <comma> we  understand  that  if  we  want  to  change  our  trajectory <comma> in  life <comma> or  in  the  balloon <comma> we  have  to  change  altitude <period> changing  altitude <comma> in  life <comma> that  means  raising  to  another  psychological <comma> philosophical <comma> spiritual  level <period> in  ballooning <comma> or  in  life <comma> how  do  we  change  altitude <questionmark> how  do  we  go  from  the  metaphor  to  something  more  practical  that  we  can  really  use  every  day <questionmark> well <comma> in  a  balloon  it  's  easy <comma> we  have  ballast <period> and  when  we  drop  the  ballast  overboard  we  climb <period> sand <comma> water <comma> all  the  equipment  we  do  n't  need  anymore <period> and  i  think  in  life  it  should  be  exactly  like  this <period> you  know <comma> when  people  speak  about  pioneering  spirit <comma> very  often  they  believe  that  pioneers  are  the  ones  who  have  new  ideas <period> it  's  not  true <period> the  pioneers  are  not  the  ones  who  have  new  ideas <comma> because  new  ideas  are  so  easy  to  have <period> we  just  close  our  eyes  for  a  minute  we  all  come  back  with  a  lot  of  new  ideas <period> no <comma> the  pioneer  is  the  one  who  allows  himself  to  throw  overboard  a  lot  of  ballast <period> habits <comma> certainties <comma> convictions <comma> exclamation  marks <comma> paradigms <comma> dogmas <period> and  when  we  are  able  to  do  that <comma> what  happens <questionmark> life  is  not  anymore  just  one  line  going  in  one  direction  in  one  dimension <period> no <period> life  is  going  to  be  made  out  of  all  the  possible  lines  that  go  in  all  the  possible  directions  in  three  dimensions <period> and  pioneering  spirit  will  be  each  time  we  allow  ourselves  to  explore  this  vertical  axis <period> of  course  not  just  like  the  atmosphere  in  the  balloon <comma> but  in  life  itself <period> explore  this  vertical  axis <comma> that  means  explore  all  the  different  ways  to  do <comma> all  the  different  ways  to  behave <comma> all  the  different  ways  to  think <comma> before  we  find  the  one  that  goes  in  the  direction  we  wish <period> this  is  very  practical <period> this  can  be  in  politics <period> this  can  be  in  spirituality <period> this  can  be  in  environment <comma> in  finance <comma> in  education  of  children <period> i  deeply  believe  that  life  is  a  much  greater  adventure  if  we  manage  to  do  politics  without  the  trench  between  the  left  and  the  right  wing <period> because  we  will  throw  away  these  political  dogmas <period> i  deeply  believe  that  we  can  make  much  more  protection  of  the  environment  if  we  get  rid <comma> if  we  throw  overboard  this  fundamentalism  that  some  of  the  greens  have  showed  in  the  past <period> and  that  we  can  aim  for  much  higher  spirituality  if  we  get  rid  of  the  religious  dogmas <period> throwing  overboard <comma> as  ballast <comma> to  change  our  direction <period> well <comma> these  basically  are  things  i  believed  in  such  a  long  time <period> but  actually  i  had  to  go  around  the  world  in  a  balloon  to  be  invited  to  talk  about  it <period> it  's  clear  that  it  's  not  easy  to  know  which  ballast  to  drop  and  which  altitude  to  take <period> sometime  we  need  friends <comma> family  members  or  a  psychiatrist <period> well <comma> in  balloons  we  need  weather  men <comma> the  one  who  calculate  the  direction  of  each  layer  of  wind <comma> at  which  altitude <comma> in  order  to  help  the  balloonist <period> but  sometimes  it  's  very  paradoxical <period> when  brian  jones  and  i  were  flying  around  the  world <comma> the  weather  man  asked  us <comma> one  day <comma> to  fly  quite  low <comma> and  very  slow <period> and  when  we  calculated  we  thought  we  're  never  going  to  make  it  around  the  world  at  that  speed <period> so <comma> we  disobeyed <period> we  flew  much  higher <comma> and  double  the  speed <period> and  i  was  so  proud  to  have  found  that  jetstream  that  i  called  the  weather  man <comma> and  i  told  him <comma> hey <comma> guy <comma> do  n't  you  think  we  're  good  pilots  up  there <questionmark> we  fly  twice  the  speed  you  predicted <period> and  he  told  me <comma> do  n't  do  that <period> go  down  immediately  in  order  to  slow  down <period> and  i  started  to  argue <period> i  said <comma> i  'm  not  going  to  do  that <period> we  do  n't  have  enough  gas  to  fly  so  slow <period> and  he  told  me <comma> yes <comma> but  with  the  low  pressure  you  have  on  your  left  if  you  fly  too  fast <comma> in  a  couple  of  hours  you  will  turn  left  and  end  up  at  the  north  pole <period> and  then  he  asked  me <comma> and  this  is  something  i  will  never  forget  in  my  life <comma> he  just  asked  me <comma> you  're  the  good  pilot  up  there <period> what  do  you  really  want <questionmark> you  want  to  go  very  fast  in  the  wrong  direction <comma> or  slowly  in  the  good  direction <questionmark> and  this  is  why  you  need  weathermen <period> this  is  why  you  need  people  with  long-term  vision <period> and  this  is  precisely  what  fails  in  the  political  visions  we  have  now <comma> in  the  political  governments <period> we  are  burning <comma> as  you  heard <comma> so  much  energy <comma> not  understanding  that  such  an  unsustainable  way  of  life  cannot  last  for  long <period> so <comma> we  went  down  actually <period> we  slowed  down <period> and  we  went  through  moments  of  fears  because  we  had  no  idea  how  the  little  amount  of  gas  we  had  in  the  balloon  could  allow  us  to  travel  45,000  kilometers <period> but  we  were  expected  to  have  doubts <period> we  're  expected  to  have  fears <period> and  actually  this  is  where  the  adventure  really  started <period> when  we  were  flying  over  the  sahara  and  india  it  was  nice  holidays <period> we  could  land  anytime  and  fly  back  home  with  an  airplane <period> in  the  middle  of  the  pacific <comma> when  you  do  n't  have  the  good  winds <comma> you  cannot  land <comma> you  cannot  go  back <period> that  's  a  crisis <period> that  's  the  moment  when  you  have  to  wake  up  from  the  automatic  way  of  thinking <period> that  's  the  moment  when  you  have  to  motivate  your  inner  potential <comma> your  creativity <period> that  's  when  you  throw  out  all  the  ballast <comma> all  the  certainties <comma> in  order  to  adapt  to  the  new  situation <period> and  actually <comma> we  changed  completely  our  flight  plan <period> we  changed  completely  our  strategy <period> and  after  20  days  we  landed  successfully  in  egypt <period> but  if  i  show  you  this  picture  it  's  not  to  tell  you  how  happy  we  were <period> it  's  to  show  you  how  much  gas  was  left  in  the  last  bottles <period> we  took  off  with  37  tons  of  liquid  propane <period> we  landed  with  40  kilos <period> when  i  saw  that <comma> i  made  a  promise  to  myself <period> i  made  a  promise  that  the  next  time  i  would  fly  around  the  world <comma> it  would  be  with  no  fuel <comma> independent  from  fossil  energies <comma> in  order  to  be  safe <comma> not  to  be  threatened  by  the  fuel  gauge <period> i  had  no  idea  how  it  was  possible <period> i  just  thought  it  's  a  dream  and  i  want  to  do  it <period> and  when  the  capsule  of  my  balloon  was  introduced  officially  in  the  air  and  space  museum  in  washington <comma> together  with  the  airplane  of  charles  lindbergh <comma> with  apollo  11 <comma> with  the  wright  brothers  flyer <comma> with  chuck  yeager  's  61 <comma> i  had  really  a  thought  then <period> i  thought <comma> well <comma> the  20th  century <comma> that  was  brilliant <period> it  allowed  to  do  all  those  things  there <period> but  it  will  not  be  possible  in  the  future  any  more <period> it  takes  too  much  energy <period> it  will  cost  too  much <period> it  will  be  prohibited  because  we  'll  have  to  save  our  natural  resources  in  a  few  decades  from  now <period> so  how  can  we  perpetuate  this  pioneering  spirit  with  something  that  will  be  independent  from  fossil  energy <questionmark> and  this  is  when  the  project  solar  impulse  really  started  to  turn  in  my  head <period> and  i  think  it  's  a  nice  metaphor  also  for  the  21st  century <period> pioneering  spirit  should  continue <comma> but  on  another  level <period> not  to  conquer  the  planet  or  space <comma> not  anymore <comma> it  has  been  done <comma> but  rather  to  improve  the  quality  of  life <period> how  can  we  go  through  the  ice  of  certainty  in  order  to  make  the  most  incredible  a  possible  thing <questionmark> what  is  today  completely  impossible <comma> get  rid  of  our  dependency  on  fossil  energy <period> if  you  tell  to  people <comma> we  want  to  be  independent  from  fossil  energy  in  our  world <comma> people  will  laugh  at  you <comma> except  here <comma> where  crazy  people  are  invited  to  speak <period> so <comma> the  idea  is  that  if  we  fly  around  the  world  in  a  solar  powered  airplane <comma> using  absolutely  no  fuel <comma> nobody  ever  could  say  in  the  future  that  it  's  impossible  to  do  it  for  cars <comma> for  heating  systems <comma> for  computers <comma> and  so  on  and  so  on <period> well <comma> solar  power  airplanes  are  not  new <period> they  have  flown  in  the  past <comma> but  without  saving  capabilities <comma> without  batteries <period> which  means  that  they  have  more  proven  the  limits  of  renewable  energies  than  the  potential  of  it <period> if  we  want  to  show  the  potential <comma> we  have  to  fly  day  and  night <period> that  means  to  load  the  batteries  during  the  flight <comma> in  order  to  spend  the  night  on  the  batteries <comma> and  fly  the  next  day  again <period> it  has  been  made <comma> already <comma> on  remote  controlled  little  airplane  models <comma> without  pilots <period> but  it  stays  an  anecdote  because  the  public  could  n't  identify  to  it <period> i  think  you  need  a  pilot  in  the  plane  that  can  talk  to  the  universities <comma> that  can  talk  to  students <comma> talk  to  politicians  during  the  flight <comma> and  really  make  it  a  human  adventure <period> for  that <comma> unfortunately <comma> four  meters  wingspan  is  not  enough <period> you  need  64  meter  wingspan <period> 64  meter  wingspan  to  carry  one  pilot <comma> the  batteries <comma> flies  slowly  enough  with  the  aerodynamic  efficiency <period> why  that <questionmark> because  fuel  is  not  easy  to  replace <period> that  's  for  sure <period> and  with  200  square  meters  of  solar  power  on  our  plane <comma> we  can  produce  the  same  energy  than  200  little  lightbulbs <period> that  means  a  christmas  tree <comma> a  big  christmas  tree <period> so  the  question  is <comma> how  can  you  carry  a  pilot  around  the  world  with  an  airplane  that  uses  the  same  amount  of  energy  as  a  big  christmas  tree <questionmark> people  will  tell  you  it  's  impossible <comma> and  that  's  exactly  why  we  try  to  do  it <period> we  launched  the  project  with  my  colleague  andre  borschberg  six  years  ago <period> we  have  now  70  people  in  the  team  working  on  it <period> we  have  gone  through  the  stages  of  simulation <comma> design <comma> computing <comma> preparing  the  construction  of  the  first  prototype <period> that  has  been  achieved  after  two  years  of  work <period> cockpit <comma> propeller <comma> engine <period> just  the  fuselage  here <comma> it  's  so  light <period> it  's  not  designed  by  an  artist <comma> but  it  could  be <period> 50  kilos  for  the  entire  fuselage <period> couple  of  kilos  more  for  the  wing  spars <period> this  is  the  complete  structure  of  the  airplane <period> and  one  month  ago  we  have  unveiled  it <period> you  cannot  imagine  how  it  is  for  a  team  who  has  been  working  six  years  on  it  to  show  that  it  's  not  only  a  dream  and  a  vision <comma> it  's  a  real  airplane <period> a  real  airplane  that  we  could  finally  present <period> and  what  's  the  goal  now <questionmark> the  goal  is  to  take  off <comma> end  of  this  year  for  the  first  test <comma> but  mainly  next  year <comma> spring  or  summer <comma> take  off <comma> on  our  own  power <comma> without  additional  help <comma> without  being  towed <comma> climb  to  9,000  meters  altitude <period> the  same  time  we  load  the  batteries <comma> we  run  the  engines <comma> and  when  we  get  at  the  maximum  height <comma> we  arrive  at  the  beginning  of  the  night <period> and  there <comma> there  will  be  just  one  goal <comma> just  one <comma> reach  the  next  sunrise  before  the  batteries  are  empty <period> and  this  is  exactly  the  symbol  of  our  world <period> if  our  airplane  is  too  heavy <comma> if  the  pilot  wastes  energy <comma> we  'll  never  make  it  through  the  night <period> and  in  our  world <comma> if  we  keep  on  spoiling <comma> wasting  our  energy  resources <comma> if  we  keep  on  building  things  that  consume  so  much  energy  that  most  of  the  companies  now  go  bankrupt <comma> it  's  clear  that  we  'll  never  give  the  planet  to  the  next  generation  without  a  major  problem <period> so <comma> you  see  that  this  airplane  is  more  a  symbol <period> i  do  n't  think  it  will  transport  200  people  in  the  next  years <period> but  when  lindbergh  crossed  the  atlantic <comma> the  payload  was  also  just  sufficient  for  one  person  and  some  fuel <period> and  20  years  later  there  were  200  people  in  every  airplane  crossing  the  atlantic <period> so <comma> we  have  to  start <comma> and  show  the  example <period> a  little  bit  like  on  this  picture  here <period> this  is  a  painting  from  magritte <comma> in  the  museum  in  holland  that  i  love  so  much <period> it  's  a  pipe <comma> and  it  's  written <comma> this  is  not  a  pipe <period> this  is  not  an  airplane <period> this  is  a  symbol  of  what  we  can  achieve  when  we  believe  in  the  impossible <comma> when  we  have  a  team <comma> when  we  have  pioneering  spirit <comma> and  especially  when  we  understand  that  all  the  certainties  we  have  should  be  thrown  overboard <period> what  pleases  me  very  much  is  that  in  the  beginning  i  thought  that  we  would  have  to  fly  around  the  world  with  no  fuel  in  order  to  have  our  message  been  understood <period> and  more  and  more <comma> we  're  invited  around  the  world  with  andre  to  talk  about  that  project <comma> to  talk  about  the  symbol  of  it <comma> invited  by  politicians <comma> invited  in  energy  forums <comma> in  order  to  show  that  it  's  not  anymore  completely  stupid  to  think  about  getting  rid  of  the  dependency  on  fossil  energies <period> so <comma> through  speeches  like  this  one  today <comma> through  interviews <comma> through  meetings <comma> our  goal  is  to  get  as  many  people  possible  on  the  team <period> the  success  will  not  come  if  we  just <comma> quote <comma> unquote <comma> fly  around  the  world  in  a  solar-powered  airplane <period> no <comma> the  success  will  come  if  enough  people  are  motivated  to  do  exactly  the  same  in  their  daily  life <comma> save  energy <comma> go  to  renewables <period> and  this  is  possible <period> you  know <comma> with  the  technologies  we  have  today <comma> we  can  save  between  30  and  50  percent  of  the  energy  of  a  country  in  europe <period> and  we  can  solve  half  of  the  rest  with  renewables <period> it  leaves  25  or  30  percent  for  oil <comma> gas <comma> coal <comma> nuclear <comma> or  whatever <period> this  is  acceptable <period> this  is  why  all  the  people  who  believe  in  this  type  of  spirit  are  welcome  to  be  on  that  team <period> you  can  just  go  on  solarimpulsecom <comma> subscribe  to  just  be  informed  of  what  we  're  doing <period> but  much  more <comma> to  get  advices <comma> to  give  your  comments <comma> to  spread  the  word  that  if  it  's  possible  in  the  air <comma> of  course  it  's  possible  in  the  ground <period> and  each  time  we  have  some  ice  in  the  future <comma> we  have  to  know  that  life  will  be  great <comma> and  the  success  will  be  brilliant  if  we  dare  to  overcome  our  fear  of  the  ice <comma> to  go  through  the  obstacle <comma> to  go  through  the  problem <comma> in  order  to  see  what  there  is  on  the  other  side <period> so <comma> you  see <comma> this  is  what  we  're  doing  on  our  side <period> everyone  has  his  goal <comma> has  his  dreams <comma> has  his  visions <period> the  question  i  leave  you  with  now  is  which  is  the  ballast  you  would  like  to  throw  overboard <questionmark> which  will  be  the  altitude  at  which  you  would  like  to  fly  in  your  life <comma> to  get  to  the  success  that  you  wish  to  have <comma> to  get  to  the  point  that  really  belongs  to  you <comma> with  the  potential  you  have <comma> and  the  one  you  can  really  fulfill <questionmark> because  the  most  renewable  energy  we  have  is  our  own  potential <comma> and  our  own  passion <period> so <comma> let  's  go  for  it <comma> and  i  wish  you  an  excellent  adventure  in  the  wings  of  the  future <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> i  have  to  tell  you  i  'm  both  challenged  and  excited <period> my  excitement  is <comma> i  get  a  chance  to  give  something  back <period> my  challenge  is <comma> the  shortest  seminar  i  usually  do  is  50  hours <period> i  'm  not  exaggerating <period> i  do  weekends <comma> and  what  i  do <comma> i  do  even  more  than  that <comma> obviously <comma> coach  people <comma> but  i  'm  into  immersion <period> because  how  did  you  learn  language <questionmark> you  did  n't  learn  it  by  just  learning  principles <comma> you  got  in  it  and  you  did  it  so  often  that  it  became  real <period> and  the  bottom  line  of  why  i  'm  here <comma> besides  being  a  crazy  mofo <comma> is  that  i  'm  really  in  a  position <comma> i  'm  not  here  to  motivate  you <comma> obviously <period> you  do  n't  need  that <period> and  a  lot  of  times  that  's  what  people  think  i  do <comma> and  it  's  the  furthest  thing  from  it <period> what  happens <comma> though <comma> is  people  say  to  me <comma> i  do  n't  need  any  motivation <period> and  i  say <comma> well <comma> that  's  interesting <period> that  's  not  what  i  do <period> i  'm  the  why  guy <period> i  want  to  know  why  you  do  what  you  do <period> what  is  your  motive  for  action <questionmark> what  is  it  that  drives  you  in  your  life  today <questionmark> not  10  years  ago <period> or  are  you  running  the  same  pattern <questionmark> because  i  believe  that  the  invisible  force  of  internal  drive <comma> activated <comma> is  the  most  important  thing  in  the  world <period> i  'm  here  because  i  believe  emotion  is  the  force  of  life <period> all  of  us  here  have  great  minds <period> you  know <questionmark> most  of  us  here  have  great  minds <comma> right <questionmark> i  do  n't  know  about  another  category <comma> but  we  all  know  how  to  think <period> and  with  our  minds  we  can  rationalize  anything <period> we  can  make  anything  happen <period> we  can <comma> i  agree  with  what  was  described  a  few  days  ago <comma> about  this  idea  that  people  work  in  their  self-interest <period> but  we  all  know  that  that  's  bullshit  at  times <period> you  do  n't  work  in  your  self-interest  all  the  time <comma> because  when  emotion  comes  into  it <comma> the  wiring  changes  in  the  way  it  functions <period> and  so  it  's  wonderful  for  us  to  think  intellectually  about  how  the  life  of  the  world  is <comma> and  especially  those  who  are  very  smart <comma> we  can  play  this  game  in  our  head <period> but  i  really  want  to  know  what  's  driving  you <period> and  what  i  would  like  to  maybe  invite  you  to  do  by  the  end  of  this  talk  is  explore  where  you  are  today <comma> for  two  reasons <period> one <comma> so  that  you  can  contribute  more <period> and  two <comma> so  that  hopefully  we  can  not  just  understand  other  people  more <comma> but  maybe  appreciate  them  more <comma> and  create  the  kinds  of  connections  that  can  stop  some  of  the  challenges  that  we  face  in  our  society  today <period> they  're  only  going  to  get  magnified  by  the  very  technology  that  's  connecting  us <comma> because  it  's  making  us  intersect <period> and  that  intersection  does  n't  always  create  the  view  of  everybody  now  understands  everybody <comma> and  everybody  appreciates  everybody  so <comma> i've  had  an  obsession  basically  for  30  years <comma> and  that  obsession  has  been <comma> what  makes  the  difference  in  the  quality  of  peoples  lives <questionmark> what  makes  the  difference  in  their  performance  because  that  's  what  i  got  hired  to  do <period> i've  got  to  produce  the  result  now <period> that  's  what  i've  done  for  30  years <period> i  get  the  phone  call  when  the  athlete  is  burning  down  on  national  television <comma> and  they  were  ahead  by  five  strokes  and  now  they  cannot  get  back  on  the  course <period> and  i've  got  to  do  something  right  now  to  get  the  result  or  nothing  matters <period> i  get  the  phone  call  when  the  child  is  going  commit  suicide <comma> and  i've  got  to  do  something  right  now <period> and  in  29  years <comma> i  'm  very  grateful  to  tell  you  i've  never  lost  one  in  29  years <period> it  does  n't  mean  i  wo  n't  some  day <period> but  i  have  n't  done  it <comma> and  the  reason  is  an  understanding  of  these  human  needs  that  i  want  to  talk  to  you  about <period> so <comma> when  i  get  those  calls  about  performance <comma> that  's  one  thing <period> how  do  you  make  a  change <questionmark> but  also <comma> i  'm  looking  to  see  what  is  it  that  's  shaping  that  person  's  ability  to  contribute <comma> to  do  something  beyond  themselves <period> so  maybe  the  real  question  is <comma> you  know <comma> i  look  at  life  and  say <comma> there  's  two  master  lessons <period> one  is <comma> there  's  the  science  of  achievement <comma> which  almost  everything  that  's  run  is  mastered  to  an  amazing  extent <period> that  's  how  do  you  take  the  invisible  and  make  it  visible <comma> right <questionmark> how  do  you  take  what  you  're  dreaming  of  and  make  it  happen <questionmark> whether  it  be  your  business <comma> your  contribution  to  society <comma> money <comma> whatever  it  is  for  you <comma> your  body <comma> your  family <period> but  the  other  lesson  of  life  that  is  rarely  mastered  is  the  art  of  fulfillment <period> because  science  is  easy <comma> right <questionmark> we  know  the  rules <period> you  write  the  code <period> you  follow  the <comma> and  you  get  the  results <period> once  you  know  the  game  you  just <comma> you  know <comma> you  up  the  ante <comma> do  n't  you <questionmark> but  when  it  comes  to  fulfillment <comma> that  's  an  art <period> and  the  reason  is <comma> it  's  about  appreciation  and  it  's  about  contribution <period> you  can  only  feel  so  much  by  yourself <period> so <comma> i've  had  an  interesting  laboratory  to  try  to  answer  the  question  of  the  real  question <comma> which  is  what  's  the  difference  in  somebody  's  life  if  you  look  at  somebody  like  those  people  that  you've  given  everything  to <questionmark> like  all  the  resources  they  say  they  need <period> you  gave  them  not  a  100-dollar  computer <period> you  gave  them  the  best  computer <period> you  gave  them  love <period> you  gave  them  joy <period> you  were  there  to  comfort  them <period> and  those  people  very  often <comma> and  you  know  some  of  them <comma> i  'm  sure <comma> end  up  the  rest  of  their  life  with  all  this  love <comma> education <comma> money  and  background <comma> spending  their  life  going  in  and  out  of  rehab <period> and  then  you  meet  people  that  have  been  through  ultimate  pain <comma> psychologically <comma> sexually <comma> spiritually <comma> emotionally  abused <comma> and  not  always <comma> but  often <comma> they  become  some  of  the  people  that  contribute  the  most  to  society <period> so <comma> the  question  we've  got  to  ask  ourselves  really  is <comma> what  is  it <questionmark> what  is  it  that  shapes  us <questionmark> and  we  live  in  a  therapy  culture <period> most  of  us  do  n't  do  that <comma> but  the  culture  's  a  therapy  culture <period> and  what  i  mean  by  that  is  the  mindset  that  we  are  our  past <period> and  everybody  in  this  room <comma> you  would  n't  be  in  this  room  if  you  bought  that  theory <comma> but  the <comma> most  of  society  thinks  biography  is  destiny <period> the  past  equals  the  future <period> and  of  course  it  does  if  you  live  there <period> but  what  people  in  this  room  know <comma> and  what  we  have  to  remind  ourselves <comma> though <comma> because  you  can  know  something  intellectually <comma> you  can  know  what  to  do  and  then  not  use  it <comma> not  apply  it <period> so  really <comma> we  're  going  to  remind  ourselves  that  decision  is  the  ultimate  power <period> that  's  what  it  really  is <period> now <comma> when  you  ask  people <comma> you  know <comma> have  you  failed  to  achieve  something <questionmark> how  many  have  ever  failed  to  achieve  something  significant  in  your  life <questionmark> say <comma> aye  audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> thanks  for  the  interaction  on  a  high  level  there <period> but  if  you  ask  people <comma> why  did  n't  you  achieve  something <questionmark> somebody  who  's  working  for  you <comma> you  know <comma> or  a  partner <comma> or  even  yourself <period> when  you  fail  to  achieve  a  goal <comma> what  's  the  reason  people  say  they  fail  to  achieve <questionmark> what  do  they  tell  you <questionmark> do  n't  have  the <comma> did  n't  know  enough <comma> did  n't  have  the <comma> knowledge <period> did  n't  have  the <comma> money <period> did  n't  have  the <comma> time <period> did  n't  have  the <comma> technology <period> you  know <period> i  did  n't  have  the  right  manager <period> did  n't  have  the <period> al  gore <comma> supreme  court <period> tr <comma> and <comma> and <comma> what  do  all  those <comma> including  the  supreme  court <comma> have  in  common <questionmark> they  are  a  claim  to  you  missing  resources <comma> and  they  may  be  accurate <period> you  may  not  have  the  money <period> you  may  not  have  the  supreme  court <period> but  that  is  not  the  defining  factor <period> and  you  correct  me  if  i  'm  wrong <period> the  defining  factor  is  never  resources <period> it  's  resourcefulness <period> and  what  i  mean  specifically <comma> rather  than  just  some  phrase <comma> is  if  you  have  emotion <comma> human  emotion <comma> something  that  i  experienced  from  you  a  day  before  yesterday  at  a  level  that  is  as  profound  as  i've  ever  experienced <comma> and  if  you'd  communicated  with  that  emotion  i  believe  you  would  have  beat  his  ass  and  won <period> but <comma> how  easy  for  me  to  tell  him  what  he  should  do <period> idiot <comma> robbins <period> but  i  know  when  we  watched  the  debate  at  that  time <comma> there  were  emotions  that  blocked  people  's  ability  to  get  this  man  's  intellect  and  capacity <period> and  the  way  that  it  came  across  to  some  people  on  that  day <comma> because  i  know  people  that  wanted  to  vote  in  your  direction  and  did  n't <comma> and  i  was  upset <period> but  there  was  emotion  that  was  there <period> how  many  know  what  i  'm  talking  about  here <questionmark> say <comma> aye <period> audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> so <comma> emotion  is  it <period> and  if  we  get  the  right  emotion <comma> we  can  get  ourselves  to  do  anything <period> we  can  get  through  it <period> if  you  're  creative  enough <comma> playful  enough <comma> fun  enough <comma> can  you  get  through  to  anybody <questionmark> yes  or  no <questionmark> audience <comma> yes <period> tr <comma> if  you  do  n't  have  the  money <comma> but  you  're  creative  and  determined  enough <comma> you  find  the  way <period> so  this  is  the  ultimate  resource <period> but  this  is  not  the  story  that  people  tell  us <comma> right <questionmark> the  story  people  tell  us  is  a  bunch  of  different  stories <period> they  tell  us  we  do  n't  have  the  resources <comma> but  ultimately <comma> if  you  take  a  look  here <comma> flip  it  up <comma> if  you  would <comma> they  say <comma> what  are  all  the  reasons  they  have  n't  accomplished  that <questionmark> next  one <comma> please <period> he  's  broken  my  pattern <comma> that  son-of-a-bitch <period> but  i  appreciated  the  energy <comma> i  'll  tell  you  that <period> what  determines  your  resources <questionmark> we've  said  decisions  shape  destiny <comma> which  is  my  focus  here <period> if  decisions  shape  destiny <comma> what  determines  it  is  three  decisions <period> what  are  you  going  to  focus  on <questionmark> right  now <comma> you  have  to  decide  what  you  're  going  to  focus  on <period> in  this  second <comma> consciously  or  unconsciously <comma> the  minute  you  decide  to  focus  on  something  you've  got  to  give  it  a  meaning <comma> and  whatever  that  meaning  is  produces  emotion <period> is  this  the  end  or  the  beginning <questionmark> is  god  punishing  me  or  rewarding  me <comma> or  is  this  the  roll  of  the  dice <questionmark> an  emotion <comma> then <comma> creates  what  we  're  going  to  do  or  the  action <period> so <comma> think  about  your  own  life <period> the  decisions  that  have  shaped  your  destiny <period> and  that  sounds  really  heavy <comma> but  in  the  last  five  or  10  years <comma> 15  years <comma> how  have  there  been  some  decisions  you've  made  that  if  you'd  made  a  different  decision <comma> your  life  would  be  completely  different <questionmark> how  many  can  think  about  it <questionmark> honestly <comma> better  or  worse <questionmark> say <comma> aye <period> audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> so  the  bottom  line  is <comma> maybe  it  was  where  to  go  to  work <comma> and  you  met  the  love  of  your  life  there <period> maybe  it  was  a  career  decision <period> i  know  the  google  geniuses  i  saw  here <comma> i  mean <comma> i  understand  that  their  decision  was  to  sell  their  technology  at  first <period> what  if  they  made  that  decision  versus  to  build  their  own  culture <questionmark> how  would  the  world  be  different <questionmark> how  would  their  lives  be  different <questionmark> their  impact <questionmark> the  history  of  our  world  is  these  decisions <period> when  a  woman  stands  up  and  says <comma> no <comma> i  wo  n't  go  to  the  back  of  the  bus <comma> she  did  n't  just  affect  her  life <period> that  decision  shaped  our  culture <period> or  someone  standing  in  front  of  a  tank <period> or  being  in  a  position  like  lance  armstrong <comma> and  someone  says  to  you <comma> you've  got  testicular  cancer  that  's  pretty  tough  for  any  male <comma> especially  if  you  ride  a  bike <period> you've  got  it  in  your  brain <period> you've  got  it  in  your  lungs <period> but  what  was  his  decision  of  what  to  focus  on <questionmark> different  than  most  people <period> what  did  it  mean <questionmark> it  was  n't  the  end <period> it  was  the  beginning <period> what  am  i  going  to  do <questionmark> he  goes  off  and  wins  seven  championships  he  never  once  won  before  the  cancer <comma> because  he  got  emotional  fitness <comma> psychological  strength <period> that  's  the  difference  in  human  beings  that  i've  seen  of  the  three  million  that  i've  been  around <period> because  that  's  about  my  lab <period> i've  had  three  million  people  from  80  different  countries  that  i've  had  a  chance  to  interact  with  over  the  last  29  years <period> and  after  a  while <comma> patterns  become  obvious <period> you  see  that  south  america  and  africa  may  be  connected  in  a  certain  way <comma> right <questionmark> other  people  say <comma> oh <comma> that  sounds  ridiculous  it  's  simple <period> so <comma> what  shaped  lance <questionmark> what  shapes  you <questionmark> two  invisible  forces <period> very  quickly <period> one <comma> state <period> we  all  have  had  time <period> so  if  you  had  a  time  you  did  something <comma> and  after  you  did  it  you  thought  to  yourself <comma> i  cannot  believe  i  said  that <comma> i  cannot  believe  i  did  that <comma> that  was  so  stupid <comma> who  's  been  there <questionmark> say <comma> aye  audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> have  you  ever  done  something <comma> after  you  did  it <comma> you  go <comma> that  was  me  right <questionmark> it  was  n't  your  ability <period> it  was  your  state <period> your  model  of  the  world  is  what  shapes  you  long  term <period> your  model  of  the  world  is  the  filter <period> that  's  what  's  shaping  us <period> that  's  what  makes  people  make  decisions <period> when  we  want  to  influence  somebody <comma> we've  got  to  know  what  already  influences  them <period> and  it  's  made  up  of  three  parts <comma> i  believe <period> first <comma> what  's  your  target <questionmark> what  are  you  after <questionmark> which <comma> i  believe <comma> it  's  not  your  desires <period> you  can  get  your  desires  or  goals <period> how  many  have  ever  got  a  goal  or  desire  and  thought <comma> is  this  all  there  is <questionmark> how  many  have  been  there <questionmark> say <comma> aye  audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> so <comma> it  's  needs  we  have <period> i  believe  there  are  six  human  needs <period> second <comma> once  you  know  what  the  target  that  's  driving  you  is  and  you  uncover  it  for  the  truth <comma> you  do  n't  form  it <period> you  uncover  it <comma> then  you  find  out  what  's  your  map <comma> what  's  the  belief  systems  that  are  telling  you  how  to  get  those  needs <period> some  people  think  the  way  to  get  those  needs  is  destroy  the  world <comma> some  people  is  to  build  something <comma> create  something <comma> love  someone <period> and  then  there  's  the  fuel  you  pick <period> so  very  quickly <comma> six  needs <period> let  me  tell  you  what  they  are <period> first  one <comma> certainty <period> now <comma> these  are  not  goals  or  desires <comma> these  are  universal <period> everyone  needs  certainty  that  they  can  avoid  pain  and  at  least  be  comfortable <period> now <comma> how  do  you  get  it <questionmark> control  everybody <questionmark> develop  a  skill <questionmark> give  up <questionmark> smoke  a  cigarette <questionmark> and  if  you  got  totally  certain <comma> ironically <comma> even  though  we  all  need  that <comma> like  if  you  're  not  certain  about  your  health <comma> or  your  children <comma> or  money <comma> you  do  n't  think  about  much <period> you  're  not  sure  if  the  ceiling  's  going  to  hold  up <comma> you  're  not  going  to  listen  to  any  speaker <period> but <comma> while  we  go  for  certainty  differently <comma> if  we  get  total  certainty <comma> we  get  what <questionmark> what  do  you  feel  if  you  're  certain <questionmark> you  know  what  's  going  to  happen <comma> when  it  's  going  to  happen <period> how  it  's  going  to  happen <comma> what  would  you  feel <questionmark> bored  out  of  your  minds <period> so <comma> god <comma> in  her  infinite  wisdom <comma> gave  us  a  second  human  need <comma> which  is  uncertainty <period> we  need  variety <period> we  need  surprise <period> how  many  of  you  here  love  surprises <questionmark> say <comma> aye  audience <comma> aye <period> tr <comma> bullshit <period> you  like  the  surprises  you  want <period> the  ones  you  do  n't  want  you  call  problems <comma> but  you  need  them <period> so <comma> variety  is  important <period> have  you  ever  rented  a  video  or  a  film  that  you've  already  seen <questionmark> who  's  done  this <questionmark> get  a  fucking  life <period> all  right <period> why  are  you  doing  it <questionmark> you  're  certain  it  's  good  because  you  read  it  before <comma> saw  it  before <comma> but  you  're  hoping  it  's  been  long  enough  you've  forgotten <comma> that  there  's  variety <period> third  human  need <comma> critical <comma> significance <period> we  all  need  to  feel  important <comma> special <comma> unique <period> you  can  get  it  by  making  more  money <period> you  can  do  it  by  being  more  spiritual <period> you  can  do  it  by  getting  yourself  in  a  situation  where  you  put  more  tattoos  and  earrings  in  places  humans  do  n't  want  to  know <period> whatever  it  takes <period> the  fastest  way  to  do  this <comma> if  you  have  no  background <comma> no  culture <comma> no  belief  and  resources  or  resourcefulness <comma> is  violence <period> if  i  put  a  gun  to  your  head  and  i  live  in  the  hood <comma> instantly  i  'm  significant <period> zero  to  10 <period> how  high <questionmark> 10 <period> how  certain  am  i  that  you  're  going  to  respond  to  me <questionmark> 10 <period> how  much  uncertainty <questionmark> who  knows  what  's  going  to  happen  next <questionmark> kind  of  exciting <period> like  climbing  up  into  a  cave  and  doing  that  stuff  all  the  way  down  there <period> total  variety  and  uncertainty <period> and  it  's  significant <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> so  you  want  to  risk  your  life  for  it <period> so  that  's  why  violence  has  always  been  around  and  will  be  around  unless  we  have  a  consciousness  change  as  a  species <period> now <comma> you  can  get  significance  a  million  ways <comma> but  to  be  significant <comma> you've  got  to  be  unique  and  different <period> here  's  what  we  really  need <comma> connection  and  love <comma> fourth  need <period> we  all  want  it <period> most  people  settle  for  connection  because  love  's  too  scary <period> do  n't  want  to  get  hurt <period> who  here  has  ever  been  hurt  in  an  intimate  relationship <questionmark> say <comma> aye <period> if  you  do  n't  raise  your  hand <comma> you  'll  have  had  other  shit  too <comma> come  on <period> and  you  're  going  to  get  hurt  again <period> are  n't  you  glad  you  came  to  this  positive  visit <questionmark> but  here  's  what  's  true <comma> we  need  it <period> we  can  do  it  through  intimacy <comma> through  friendship <comma> through  prayer <comma> through  walking  in  nature <period> if  nothing  else  works  for  you <comma> get  a  dog <period> do  n't  get  a  cat <period> get  a  dog <period> because  if  you  leave  for  two  minutes <comma> it  's  like  you've  been  gone  for  six  months  when  you  show  back  up  again  five  minutes  later <comma> right <questionmark> now <comma> these  first  four  needs <comma> every  human  finds  a  way  to  meet <period> even  if  you  lie  to  yourself <comma> you  need  to  have  split  personalities <period> but  the  last  two  needs <comma> the  first  four  needs  are  called  the  needs  of  the  personalities <comma> is  what  i  call  it <comma> the  last  two  are  the  needs  of  the  spirit <period> and  this  is  where  fulfillment  comes <period> you  wo  n't  get  fulfillment  from  the  first  four <period> you  'll  figure  a  way <comma> smoke <comma> drink <comma> do  whatever <comma> to  meet  the  first  four <comma> but  the  last  two <comma> number  five <comma> you  must  grow <period> we  all  know  the  answer  here <period> if  you  do  n't  grow <comma> you  're  what <questionmark> if  a  relationship  's  not  growing <comma> if  a  business  is  not  growing <comma> if  you  're  not  growing <comma> it  does  n't  matter  how  much  money  you  have <comma> how  many  friends  you  have <comma> how  many  people  love  you <comma> you  feel  like  hell <period> and  the  reason  we  grow <comma> i  believe <comma> is  so  we  have  something  to  give  of  value <period> because  the  sixth  need  is  to  contribute  beyond  ourselves <period> because  we  all  know <comma> corny  as  it  sounds <comma> the  secret  to  living  is  giving <period> we  all  know  life  's  not  about  me <period> it  's  about  we <period> this  culture  knows  that <period> this  room  knows  that <period> and  it  's  exciting <period> when  you  see  nicholas  up  here  talking  about  his  $100  computer <comma> the  most  passionate  exciting  thing  is <comma> here  's  a  genius <comma> but  he  's  got  a  calling  now <period> you  can  feel  the  difference  in  him  and  it  's  beautiful <period> and  that  calling  can  touch  other  people <period> in  my  own  life <comma> my  life  was  touched  because  when  i  was  11  years  old <period> thanksgiving <comma> no  money <comma> no  food <comma> we  're  not  going  to  starve <comma> but  my  father  was  totally  messed  up <period> my  mom  was  letting  him  know  how  bad  he  messed  up <period> and  somebody  came  to  the  door  and  delivered  food <period> my  father  made  three  decisions <period> i  know  what  they  were  briefly <period> his  focus  was <comma> this  is  charity <period> what  does  it  mean <questionmark> i  'm  worthless <period> what've  i  got  to  do <questionmark> leave  my  family  which  he  did <period> the  time  was  one  of  the  most  painful  experiences  of  life <period> my  three  decisions  gave  me  a  different  path <period> i  said <comma> focus  on <comma> there  's  food' <comma> what  a  concept <comma> you  know <period> second <comma> but  this  is  what  changed  my  life <comma> this  is  what  shaped  me  as  a  human  being <comma> somebody  's  gift <period> i  do  n't  even  know  who  it  is  my  father  always  said <comma> no  one  gives  a  shit  and  all  of  a  sudden <comma> somebody  i  do  n't  know <comma> they  're  not  asking  for  anything <comma> they  're  just  giving  our  family  food <comma> looking  out  for  us <period> it  made  me  believe  this <comma> what  does  it  mean  that  strangers  care  and  what  that  made  me  decide  is <comma> if  strangers  care  about  me  and  my  family <comma> i  care  about  them <period> what  am  i  going  to  do <questionmark> i  'm  going  to  do  something  to  make  a  difference <period> so <comma> when  i  was  17 <comma> i  went  out  one  day  on  thanksgiving <period> it  was  my  target  for  years  to  have  enough  money  to  feed  two  families <period> the  most  fun  thing  i  ever  did  in  my  life <comma> the  most  moving <period> then  next  year  i  did  four <period> i  did  n't  tell  anybody  what  i  was  doing <period> next  year  eight <period> i  was  n't  doing  it  for  brownie  points <comma> but  after  eight <comma> i  thought <comma> shit <comma> i  could  use  some  help <period> so  sure  enough <comma> i  went  out  and  what  did  i  do <questionmark> i  got  my  friends  involved  and  i  grew  companies  and  then  i  got  11  companies  and  i  built  the  foundation <period> now <comma> 18  years  later <comma> i  'm  proud  to  tell  you <comma> last  year  we  fed  two  million  people  in  35  countries  through  our  foundation <comma> all  during  the  holidays <comma> thanksgiving <comma> christmas <comma> in  all  the  different  countries  around  the  world <period> it  's  been  fantastic <period> thank  you <period> so <comma> i  do  n't  tell  you  that  to  brag <period> i  tell  you  because  i  'm  proud  of  human  beings <comma> because  they  get  excited  to  contribute  once  they've  had  the  chance  to  experience  it <comma> not  talk  about  it <period> so <comma> finally <comma> and  i  'm  about  out  of  time <comma> the  target  that  shapes  you <comma> here  's  what  's  different  about  people <period> we  have  the  same  needs <comma> but  are  you  a  certainty  freak <questionmark> is  that  what  you  value  most <comma> or  uncertainty <questionmark> this  man  here  could  n't  be  a  certainty  freak  if  he  climbed  through  those  caves <period> are  you  driven  by  significance  or  love <questionmark> we  all  need  all  six <comma> but  whatever  your  lead  system  is <comma> tilts  you  in  a  different  direction <period> and  as  you  move  in  a  direction <comma> you  have  a  destination  or  destiny <period> the  second  piece  is  the  map <period> think  of  that  as  the  operating  system  that  tells  you  how  to  get  there <period> and  some  people  's  map  is <comma> i  'm  going  to  save  lives  even  if  i  die  for  other  people <comma> and  they  're  firemen <period> somebody  else  is <comma> i  'm  going  to  kill  people  to  do  it  they  're  trying  to  meet  the  same  needs  of  significance <comma> right <questionmark> they  want  to  honor  god  or  honor  their  family <comma> but  they  have  a  different  map <period> and  there  are  seven  different  beliefs <period> i  cannot  go  through  them  because  i  'm  done <period> the  last  piece  is  emotion <period> i'd  say  one  of  the  parts  of  the  map  is  like  time <period> some  people  's  idea  of  a  long  time  is  100  years <period> somebody  else  's  is  three  seconds <comma> which  is  what  i  have <period> and  the  last  one  i've  already  mentioned <comma> that  fell  to  you <period> if  you've  got  a  target  and  you've  got  a  map  and  let  's  say <comma> i  cannot  use  google  because  i  love  macs  and  they  have  n't  made  it  good  for  macs  yet <comma> so  if  you  use  mapquest <comma> how  many  have  made  this  fatal  mistake  of  using  mapquest  at  some  time <questionmark> you  use  this  thing  and  you  do  n't  get  there <period> well <comma> imagine  if  your  beliefs  guarantee  you  can  never  get  to  where  you  want  to  go <questionmark> the  last  thing  is  emotion <period> now <comma> here  's  what  i  'll  tell  you  about  emotion <period> there  are  6,000  emotions  that  we  all  have  words  for  in  the  english  language <comma> which  is  just  a  linguistic  representation <comma> right <comma> that  changes  by  language <period> but  if  your  dominant  emotions <comma> if  i  had  more  time <comma> i  have  20,000  people  or  1,000 <comma> and  i  have  them  write  down  all  the  emotions  that  they  experience  in  an  average  week <comma> and  i  gave  them  as  long  as  they  needed <period> and  on  one  side  they  write  empowering  emotions <comma> the  other  's  disempowering  -- <period> guess  how  many  emotions  people  experience <questionmark> less  than  12 <period> and  half  of  those  make  them  feel  like  shit <period> so  they  got  five  or  six  good  frickin  feelings <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  like  they  feel  happy <comma> happy <comma> excited <comma> oh  shit <comma> frustrated <comma> frustrated <comma> overwhelmed <comma> depressed  how  many  of  you  know  somebody  who  no  matter  what  happens  finds  a  way  to  get  pissed  off <questionmark> how  many  know  somebody  like  this <questionmark> or <comma> no  matter  what  happens <comma> they  find  a  way  to  be  happy  or  excited <period> how  may  know  somebody  like  this <questionmark> come  on <period> when  9/11  happened <comma> i  'll  finish  with  this <comma> i  was  in  hawaii <period> i  was  with  2,000  people  from  45  countries <period> we  were  translating  four  languages  simultaneously  for  a  program  that  i  was  conducting  for  a  week <period> the  night  before  was  called  emotional  mastering  i  got  up <comma> had  no  plan  for  the  this <comma> and  i  said <comma> we  had  all  these  fireworks <comma> i  do  crazy  shit <comma> fun  stuff <comma> and  then  at  the  end  i  stopped <comma> i  had  this  plan  i  was  going  to  say  but  i  never  do  what  i  'm  going  to  say <period> and  all  of  a  sudden  i  said <comma> when  do  people  really  start  to  live <questionmark> when  they  face  death  and  then  i  went  through  this  whole  thing  about <comma> if  you  were  n't  going  to  get  off  this  island <comma> if  nine  days  from  now  you  were  going  to  die <comma> who  would  you  call <comma> what  would  you  say <comma> what  would  you  do <questionmark> one  woman <comma> well <comma> that  night  is  when  9/11  happened <comma> one  woman  had  come  to  the  seminar  and  when  she  came  there <comma> her  previous  boyfriend  had  been  kidnapped  and  murdered <period> her  friend <comma> her  new  boyfriend <comma> wanted  to  marry  her <comma> and  she  said  no <period> he  said <comma> if  you  leave  and  go  to  that  hawaii  thing <comma> it  's  over  with  us  she  said <comma> it  's  over  when  i  finished  that  night <comma> she  called  him  and  left  a  message <comma> true  story <comma> at  the  top  of  the  world  trade  center  where  he  worked <comma> saying <comma> honey <comma> i  love  you <comma> i  just  want  you  to  know  i  want  to  marry  you <period> it  was  stupid  of  me  she  was  asleep <comma> because  it  was  3  am <period> for  us <comma> when  he  called  her  back  from  the  top  and  said <comma> honey <comma> i  cannot  tell  you  what  this  means  he  said <comma> i  do  n't  know  how  to  tell  you  this <comma> but  you  gave  me  the  greatest  gift  because  i  'm  going  to  die  and  she  played  the  recording  for  us  in  the  room <period> she  was  on  larry  king  later <comma> and  he  said <comma> you  're  probably  wondering  how  on  earth  this  could  happen  to  you  twice  and  he  said <comma> all  i  can  say  to  you  is <comma> this  must  be  god  's  message  to  you <comma> honey <period> from  now  on <comma> every  day  give  your  all <comma> love  your  all <period> do  n't  let  anything  ever  stop  you  she  finishes <comma> and  a  man  stands  up  and  he  says <comma> i  'm  from  pakistan <period> i  'm  a  muslim <period> i'd  love  to  hold  your  hand  and  say  i  'm  sorry <comma> but <comma> frankly <comma> this  is  retribution  i  cannot  tell  you  the  rest  because  i  'm  out  of  time <period> 10  seconds <period> 10  seconds <comma> that  's  all <period> i  want  to  be  respectful <period> 10  seconds <period> all  i  can  tell  you  is <comma> i  brought  this  man  on  stage  with  a  man  from  new  york  who  worked  in  the  world  trade  center <comma> because  i  had  about  200  new  yorkers  there <period> more  than  50  lost  their  entire  companies <comma> their  friends <comma> marking  off  their  palm  pilots <comma> one  financial  trader <comma> this  woman  made  of  steel <comma> bawling <comma> 30  friends  crossing  off  that  all  died <period> and  what  i  did  to  people  is  said <comma> what  are  we  going  to  focus  on <questionmark> what  does  this  mean  and  what  are  we  going  to  do  and  i  took  the  group  and  got  people  to  focus  on <comma> if  you  did  n't  lose  somebody  today <comma> your  focus  is  going  to  be  how  to  serve  somebody  else <period> there  are  people <comma> then  one  woman  got  up  and  she  was  so  angry  and  screaming  and  yelling <period> then  i  found  out  she  was  n't  from  new  york <period> she  's  not  an  american <period> she  does  n't  know  anybody  here <period> i  said <comma> do  you  always  get  angry  she  said <comma> yes  guilty  people  got  guilty <comma> sad  people  got  sad <period> and  i  took  these  two  men  and  did  what  i  call  an  indirect  negotiation <period> jewish  man  with  family  in  the  occupied  territory <comma> someone  in  new  york  who  would  have  died  if  he  was  at  work  that  day <comma> and  this  man  who  wanted  to  be  a  terrorist  and  made  it  very  clear <period> and  the  integration  that  happened  is  on  a  film <comma> which  i  'll  be  happy  to  send  you <comma> so  you  can  really  see  what  actually  happened  instead  of  my  verbalization  of  it <period> but  the  two  of  them  not  only  came  together  and  changed  their  beliefs  and  morals  of  the  world <comma> but  they  worked  together  to  bring <comma> for  almost  four  years  now <comma> through  various  mosques  and  synagogues <comma> the  idea  of  how  to  create  peace <period> and  he  wrote  a  book <comma> which  is  called  my  jihad <comma> my  way  of  peace  so <comma> transformation  can  happen <period> so  my  invitation  to  you  is  this <comma> explore  your  web <comma> the  web  in  here <comma> the  needs <comma> the  beliefs <comma> the  emotions  that  are  controlling  you <period> for  two  reasons <comma> so  there  's  more  of  you  to  give <comma> and  achieve  too <comma> we  all  want  to  do  it <comma> but  i  mean  give <comma> because  that  's  what  's  going  to  fill  you  up <period> and  secondly <comma> so  you  can  appreciate <comma> not  just  understand <comma> that  's  intellectual <comma> that  's  the  mind <comma> but  appreciate  what  's  driving  other  people <period> it  's  the  only  way  our  world  's  going  to  change <period> god  bless  you <period> thank  you <period> i  hope  this  was  of  service <period> how  do  you  observe  something  you  cannot  see <questionmark> this  is  the  basic  question  of  somebody  who  's  interested  in  finding  and  studying  black  holes <period> because  black  holes  are  objects  whose  pull  of  gravity  is  so  intense  that  nothing  can  escape  it <comma> not  even  light <comma> so  you  cannot  see  it  directly <period> so <comma> my  story  today  about  black  holes  is  about  one  particular  black  hole <period> i  'm  interested  in  finding  whether  or  not  there  is  a  really  massive <comma> what  we  like  to  call  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy <period> and  the  reason  this  is  interesting  is  that  it  gives  us  an  opportunity  to  prove  whether  or  not  these  exotic  objects  really  exist <period> and  second <comma> it  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  understand  how  these  supermassive  black  holes  interact  with  their  environment <comma> and  to  understand  how  they  affect  the  formation  and  evolution  of  the  galaxies  which  they  reside  in <period> so <comma> to  begin  with <comma> we  need  to  understand  what  a  black  hole  is  so  we  can  understand  the  proof  of  a  black  hole <period> so <comma> what  is  a  black  hole <questionmark> well <comma> in  many  ways  a  black  hole  is  an  incredibly  simple  object <comma> because  there  are  only  three  characteristics  that  you  can  describe <comma> the  mass <comma> the  spin <comma> and  the  charge <period> and  i  'm  going  to  only  talk  about  the  mass <period> so <comma> in  that  sense <comma> it  's  a  very  simple  object <period> but  in  another  sense <comma> it  's  an  incredibly  complicated  object  that  we  need  relatively  exotic  physics  to  describe <comma> and  in  some  sense  represents  the  breakdown  of  our  physical  understanding  of  the  universe <period> but  today <comma> the  way  i  want  you  to  understand  a  black  hole <comma> for  the  proof  of  a  black  hole <comma> is  to  think  of  it  as  an  object  whose  mass  is  confined  to  zero  volume <period> so <comma> despite  the  fact  that  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  an  object  that  's  supermassive <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  get  to  what  that  really  means  in  a  moment <comma> it  has  no  finite  size <period> so <comma> this  is  a  little  tricky <period> but  fortunately  there  is  a  finite  size  that  you  can  see <comma> and  that  's  known  as  the  schwarzschild  radius <period> and  that  's  named  after  the  guy  who  recognized  why  it  was  such  an  important  radius <period> this  is  a  virtual  radius <comma> not  reality <period> the  black  hole  has  no  size <period> so  why  is  it  so  important <questionmark> it  's  important  because  it  tells  us  that  any  object  can  become  a  black  hole <period> that  means  you <comma> your  neighbor <comma> your  cellphone <comma> the  auditorium  can  become  a  black  hole  if  you  can  figure  out  how  to  compress  it  down  to  the  size  of  the  schwarzschild  radius <period> at  that  point <comma> what  's  going  to  happen <questionmark> at  that  point  gravity  wins <period> gravity  wins  over  all  other  known  forces <period> and  the  object  is  forced  to  continue  to  collapse  to  an  infinitely  small  object <period> and  then  it  's  a  black  hole <period> so <comma> if  i  were  to  compress  the  earth  down  to  the  size  of  a  sugar  cube <comma> it  would  become  a  black  hole <comma> because  the  size  of  a  sugar  cube  is  its  schwarzschild  radius <period> now <comma> the  key  here  is  to  figure  out  what  that  schwarzschild  radius  is <period> and  it  turns  out  that  it  's  actually  pretty  simple  to  figure  out <period> it  depends  only  on  the  mass  of  the  object <period> bigger  objects  have  bigger  schwarzschild  radii <period> smaller  objects  have  smaller  schwarzschild  radii <period> so <comma> if  i  were  to  take  the  sun  and  compress  it  down  to  the  scale  of  the  university  of  oxford <comma> it  would  become  a  black  hole <period> so <comma> now  we  know  what  a  schwarzschild  radius  is <period> and  it  's  actually  quite  a  useful  concept <comma> because  it  tells  us  not  only  when  a  black  hole  will  form <comma> but  it  also  gives  us  the  key  elements  for  the  proof  of  a  black  hole <period> i  only  need  two  things <period> i  need  to  understand  the  mass  of  the  object  i  'm  claiming  is  a  black  hole <comma> and  what  its  schwarzschild  radius  is <period> and  since  the  mass  determines  the  schwarzschild  radius <comma> there  is  actually  only  one  thing  i  really  need  to  know <period> so <comma> my  job  in  convincing  you  that  there  is  a  black  hole  is  to  show  that  there  is  some  object  that  's  confined  to  within  its  schwarzschild  radius <period> and  your  job  today  is  to  be  skeptical <period> okay <comma> so <comma> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  no  ordinary  black  hole <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  supermassive  black  holes <period> so <comma> i  wanted  to  say  a  few  words  about  what  an  ordinary  black  hole  is <comma> as  if  there  could  be  such  a  thing  as  an  ordinary  black  hole <period> an  ordinary  black  hole  is  thought  to  be  the  end  state  of  a  really  massive  star  's  life <period> so <comma> if  a  star  starts  its  life  off  with  much  more  mass  than  the  mass  of  the  sun <comma> it  's  going  to  end  its  life  by  exploding  and  leaving  behind  these  beautiful  supernova  remnants  that  we  see  here <period> and  inside  that  supernova  remnant  is  going  to  be  a  little  black  hole  that  has  a  mass  roughly  three  times  the  mass  of  the  sun <period> on  an  astronomical  scale  that  's  a  very  small  black  hole <period> now <comma> what  i  want  to  talk  about  are  the  supermassive  black  holes <period> and  the  supermassive  black  holes  are  thought  to  reside  at  the  center  of  galaxies <period> and  this  beautiful  picture  taken  with  the  hubble  space  telescope  shows  you  that  galaxies  come  in  all  shapes  and  sizes <period> there  are  big  ones <period> there  are  little  ones <period> almost  every  object  in  that  picture  there  is  a  galaxy <period> and  there  is  a  very  nice  spiral  up  in  the  upper  left <period> and  there  are  a  hundred  billion  stars  in  that  galaxy <comma> just  to  give  you  a  sense  of  scale <period> and  all  the  light  that  we  see  from  a  typical  galaxy <comma> which  is  the  kind  of  galaxies  that  we  're  seeing  here <comma> comes  from  the  light  from  the  stars <period> so <comma> we  see  the  galaxy  because  of  the  star  light <period> now <comma> there  are  a  few  relatively  exotic  galaxies <period> i  like  to  call  these  the  prima  donna  of  the  galaxy  world <comma> because  they  are  kind  of  show  offs <period> and  we  call  them  active  galactic  nuclei <period> and  we  call  them  that  because  their  nucleus <comma> or  their  center <comma> are  very  active <period> so <comma> at  the  center  there <comma> that  's  actually  where  most  of  the  starlight  comes  out  from <period> and  yet <comma> what  we  actually  see  is  light  that  cannot  be  explained  by  the  starlight <period> it  's  way  more  energetic <period> in  fact <comma> in  a  few  examples  it  's  like  the  ones  that  we  're  seeing  here <period> there  are  also  jets  emanating  out  from  the  center <period> again <comma> a  source  of  energy  that  's  very  difficult  to  explain  if  you  just  think  that  galaxies  are  composed  of  stars <period> so <comma> what  people  have  thought  is  that  perhaps  there  are  supermassive  black  holes  which  matter  is  falling  on  to <period> so <comma> you  cannot  see  the  black  hole  itself <comma> but  you  can  convert  the  gravitational  energy  of  the  black  hole  into  the  light  we  see <period> so <comma> there  is  the  thought  that  maybe  supermassive  black  holes  exist  at  the  center  of  galaxies <period> but  it  's  a  kind  of  indirect  argument <period> nonetheless <comma> it  's  given  rise  to  the  notion  that  maybe  it  's  not  just  these  prima  donnas  that  have  these  supermassive  black  holes <comma> but  rather  all  galaxies  might  harbor  these  supermassive  black  holes  at  their  centers <period> and  if  that  's  the  case <comma> and  this  is  an  example  of  a  normal  galaxy <period> what  we  see  is  the  star  light <period> and  if  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole <comma> what  we  need  to  assume  is  that  it  's  a  black  hole  on  a  diet <period> because  that  is  the  way  to  suppress  the  energetic  phenomena  that  we  see  in  active  galactic  nuclei <period> if  we  're  going  to  look  for  these  stealth  black  holes  at  the  center  of  galaxies <comma> the  best  place  to  look  is  in  our  own  galaxy <comma> our  milky  way <period> and  this  is  a  wide  field  picture  taken  of  the  center  of  the  milky  way <period> and  what  we  see  is  a  line  of  stars <period> and  that  is  because  we  live  in  a  galaxy  which  has  a  flattened <comma> disk-like  structure <period> and  we  live  in  the  middle  of  it <comma> so  when  we  look  towards  the  center <comma> we  see  this  plane  which  defines  the  plane  of  the  galaxy <comma> or  line  that  defines  the  plane  of  the  galaxy <period> now <comma> the  advantage  of  studying  our  own  galaxy  is  it  's  simply  the  closest  example  of  the  center  of  a  galaxy  is  100  times  further  away <period> so <comma> we  can  see  far  more  detail  in  our  galaxy  than  anyplace  else <period> and  as  you  'll  see  in  a  moment <comma> the  ability  to  see  detail  is  key  to  this  experiment <period> so <comma> how  do  astronomers  prove  that  there  is  a  lot  of  mass  inside  a  small  volume <questionmark> which  is  the  job  that  i  have  to  show  you  today <period> and  the  tool  that  we  use  is  to  watch  the  way  stars  orbit  the  black  hole <period> stars  will  orbit  the  black  hole  in  the  very  same  way  that  planets  orbit  the  sun <period> it  's  the  gravitational  pull  that  makes  these  things  orbit <period> if  there  were  no  massive  objects  these  things  would  go  flying  off <comma> or  at  least  go  at  a  much  slower  rate  because  all  that  determines  how  they  go  around  is  how  much  mass  is  inside  its  orbit <period> so <comma> this  is  great <comma> because  remember  my  job  is  to  show  there  is  a  lot  of  mass  inside  a  small  volume <period> so <comma> if  i  know  how  fast  it  goes  around <comma> i  know  the  mass <period> and  if  i  know  the  scale  of  the  orbit  i  know  the  radius <period> so <comma> i  want  to  see  the  stars  that  are  as  close  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy  as  possible <period> because  i  want  to  show  there  is  a  mass  inside  as  small  a  region  as  possible <period> so <comma> this  means  that  i  want  to  see  a  lot  of  detail <period> and  that  's  the  reason  that  for  this  experiment  we've  used  the  world  's  largest  telescope <period> this  is  the  keck  observatory <period> it  hosts  two  telescopes  with  a  mirror  10  meters <comma> which  is  roughly  the  diameter  of  a  tennis  court <period> now <comma> this  is  wonderful <comma> because  the  campaign  promise  of  large  telescopes  is  that  is  that  the  bigger  the  telescope <comma> the  smaller  the  detail  that  we  can  see <period> but  it  turns  out  these  telescopes <comma> or  any  telescope  on  the  ground  has  had  a  little  bit  of  a  challenge  living  up  to  this  campaign  promise <period> and  that  is  because  of  the  atmosphere <period> atmosphere  is  great  for  us <period> it  allows  us  to  survive  here  on  earth <period> but  it  's  relatively  challenging  for  astronomers  who  want  to  look  through  the  atmosphere  to  astronomical  sources <period> so <comma> to  give  you  a  sense  of  what  this  is  like <comma> it  's  actually  like  looking  at  a  pebble  at  the  bottom  of  a  stream <period> looking  at  the  pebble  on  the  bottom  of  the  stream <comma> the  stream  is  continuously  moving  and  turbulent <comma> very  much  in  the  same  way <comma> it  's  very  difficult  to  see  astronomical  sources <comma> because  of  the  atmosphere  that  's  continuously  moving  by <period> so <comma> i've  spent  a  lot  of  my  career  working  on  ways  to  correct  for  the  atmosphere <comma> to  give  us  a  cleaner  view <period> and  that  buys  us  about  a  factor  of  20 <period> and  i  think  all  of  you  can  agree  that  if  you  can  figure  out  how  to  improve  life  by  a  factor  of  20 <comma> you've  probably  improved  your  lifestyle  by  a  lot <comma> say  your  salary <comma> you'd  notice <comma> or  your  kids <comma> you'd  notice <period> and  this  animation  here  shows  you  one  example  of  the  techniques  that  we  use <comma> called  adaptive  optics <period> you  're  seeing  an  animation  that  goes  between  an  example  of  what  you  would  see  if  you  do  n't  use  this  technique  -- <period> in  other  words <comma> just  a  picture  that  shows  the  stars <comma> and  the  box  is  centered  on  the  center  of  the  galaxy <comma> where  we  think  the  black  hole  is <period> so <comma> without  this  technology  you  cannot  see  the  stars <period> with  this  technology  all  of  a  sudden  you  can  see  it <period> this  technology  works  by  introducing  a  mirror  into  the  telescope  optics  system  that  's  continuously  changing  to  counteract  what  the  atmosphere  is  doing  to  you <period> so <comma> it  's  kind  of  like  very  fancy  eyeglasses  for  your  telescope <period> now <comma> in  the  next  few  slides  i  'm  just  going  to  focus  on  that  little  square  there <period> so <comma> we  're  only  going  to  look  at  the  stars  inside  that  small  square <comma> although  we've  looked  at  all  of  them <period> so <comma> i  want  to  see  how  these  things  have  moved <period> and  over  the  course  of  this  experiment <comma> these  stars  have  moved  a  tremendous  amount <period> so <comma> we've  been  doing  this  experiment  for  15  years <comma> and  we  see  the  stars  go  all  the  way  around <period> now <comma> most  astronomers  have  a  favorite  star <comma> and  mine  today  is  a  star  that  's  labeled  up  there <comma> so-2 <period> absolutely  my  favorite  star  in  the  world <period> and  that  's  because  it  goes  around  in  only  15  years <period> and  to  give  you  a  sense  of  how  short  that  is <comma> the  sun  takes  200  million  years  to  go  around  the  center  of  the  galaxy <period> stars  that  we  knew  about  before <comma> that  were  as  close  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy  as  possible <comma> take  500  years <period> and  this  one <comma> this  one  goes  around  in  a  human  lifetime <period> that  's  kind  of  profound <comma> in  a  way <period> but  it  's  the  key  to  this  experiment <period> the  orbit  tells  me  how  much  mass  is  inside  a  very  small  radius <period> so <comma> next  we  see  a  picture  here  that  shows  you  before  this  experiment  the  size  to  which  we  could  confine  the  mass  of  the  center  of  the  galaxy <period> what  we  knew  before  is  that  there  was  four  million  times  the  mass  of  the  sun  inside  that  circle <period> and  as  you  can  see <comma> there  was  a  lot  of  other  stuff  inside  that  circle <period> you  can  see  a  lot  of  stars <period> so <comma> there  was  actually  lots  of  alternatives  to  the  idea  that  there  was  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy <comma> because  you  could  put  a  lot  of  stuff  in  there <period> but  with  this  experiment <comma> we've  confined  that  same  mass  to  a  much  smaller  volume  that  's  10,000  times  smaller <period> and  because  of  that <comma> we've  been  able  to  show  that  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole  there <period> to  give  you  a  sense  of  how  small  that  size  is <comma> that  's  the  size  of  our  solar  system <period> so <comma> we  're  cramming  four  million  times  the  mass  of  the  sun  into  that  small  volume <period> now <comma> truth  in  advertising <period> right <questionmark> i  have  told  you  my  job  is  to  get  it  down  to  the  schwarzchild  radius <period> and  the  truth  is <comma> i  'm  not  quite  there <period> but  we  actually  have  no  alternative  today  to  explaining  this  concentration  of  mass <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> it  's  the  best  evidence  we  have  to  date  for  not  only  existence  of  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  our  own  galaxy <comma> but  any  in  our  universe <period> so <comma> what  next <questionmark> i  actually  think  this  is  about  as  good  as  we  're  going  to  do  with  today  's  technology <period> so  let  's  move  on  with  the  problem <period> so <comma> what  i  want  to  tell  you <comma> very  briefly <comma> is  a  few  examples  of  the  excitement  of  what  we  can  do  today  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy <comma> now  that  we  know  that  there  is <comma> or  at  least  we  believe <comma> that  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole  there <period> and  the  fun  phase  of  this  experiment  is <comma> while  we've  tested  some  of  our  ideas  about  the  consequences  of  a  supermassive  black  hole  being  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy <comma> almost  every  single  one  has  been  inconsistent  with  what  we  actually  see <period> and  that  's  the  fun <period> so <comma> let  me  give  you  the  two  examples <period> you  can  ask <comma> what  do  you  expect  for  the  old  stars <comma> stars  that  have  been  around  the  center  of  the  galaxy  for  a  long  time <comma> they've  had  plenty  of  time  to  interact  with  the  black  hole <period> what  you  expect  there  is  that  old  stars  should  be  very  clustered  around  the  black  hole <period> you  should  see  a  lot  of  old  stars  next  to  that  black  hole <period> likewise <comma> for  the  young  stars <comma> or  in  contrast <comma> the  young  stars <comma> they  just  should  not  be  there <period> a  black  hole  does  not  make  a  kind  neighbor  to  a  stellar  nursery <period> to  get  a  star  to  form <comma> you  need  a  big  ball  of  gas  and  dust  to  collapse <period> and  it  's  a  very  fragile  entity <period> and  what  does  the  big  black  hole  do <questionmark> it  strips  that  gas  cloud  apart <period> it  pulls  much  stronger  on  one  side  than  the  other  and  the  cloud  is  stripped  apart <period> in  fact <comma> we  anticipated  that  star  formation  should  n't  proceed  in  that  environment <period> so <comma> you  should  n't  see  young  stars <period> so <comma> what  do  we  see <questionmark> using  observations  that  are  not  the  ones  i've  shown  you  today <comma> we  can  actually  figure  out  which  ones  are  old  and  which  ones  are  young <period> the  old  ones  are  red <period> the  young  ones  are  blue <period> and  the  yellow  ones <comma> we  do  n't  know  yet <period> so <comma> you  can  already  see  the  surprise <period> there  is  a  dearth  of  old  stars <period> there  is  an  abundance  of  young  stars <comma> so  it  's  the  exact  opposite  of  the  prediction <period> so <comma> this  is  the  fun  part <period> and  in  fact <comma> today <comma> this  is  what  we  're  trying  to  figure  out <comma> this  mystery  of  how  do  you  get <comma> how  do  you  resolve  this  contradiction <period> so <comma> in  fact <comma> my  graduate  students  are <comma> at  this  very  moment <comma> today <comma> at  the  telescope <comma> in  hawaii <comma> making  observations  to  get  us  hopefully  to  the  next  stage <comma> where  we  can  address  this  question  of  why  are  there  so  many  young  stars <comma> and  so  few  old  stars <period> to  make  further  progress  we  really  need  to  look  at  the  orbits  of  stars  that  are  much  further  away <period> to  do  that  we  'll  probably  need  much  more  sophisticated  technology  than  we  have  today <period> because <comma> in  truth <comma> while  i  said  we  're  correcting  for  the  earth  's  atmosphere <comma> we  actually  only  correct  for  half  the  errors  that  are  introduced <period> we  do  this  by  shooting  a  laser  up  into  the  atmosphere <comma> and  what  we  think  we  can  do  is  if  we  shine  a  few  more  that  we  can  correct  the  rest <period> so  this  is  what  we  hope  to  do  in  the  next  few  years <period> and  on  a  much  longer  time  scale <comma> what  we  hope  to  do  is  build  even  larger  telescopes <comma> because <comma> remember <comma> bigger  is  better  in  astronomy <period> so <comma> we  want  to  build  a  30  meter  telescope <period> and  with  this  telescope  we  should  be  able  to  see  stars  that  are  even  closer  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy <period> and  we  hope  to  be  able  to  test  some  of  einstein  's  theories  of  general  relativity <comma> some  ideas  in  cosmology  about  how  galaxies  form <period> so <comma> we  think  the  future  of  this  experiment  is  quite  exciting <period> so <comma> in  conclusion <comma> i  'm  going  to  show  you  an  animation  that  basically  shows  you  how  these  orbits  have  been  moving <comma> in  three  dimensions <period> and  i  hope <comma> if  nothing  else <comma> i've  convinced  you  that <comma> one <comma> we  do  in  fact  have  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy <period> and  this  means  that  these  things  do  exist  in  our  universe <comma> and  we  have  to  contend  with  this <comma> we  have  to  explain  how  you  can  get  these  objects  in  our  physical  world <period> second <comma> we've  been  able  to  look  at  that  interaction  of  how  supermassive  black  holes  interact <comma> and  understand <comma> maybe <comma> the  role  in  which  they  play  in  shaping  what  galaxies  are <comma> and  how  they  work <period> none  of  this  would  have  happened  without  the  advent  of  the  tremendous  progress  that  's  been  made  on  the  technology  front <period> and  we  think  that  this  is  a  field  that  is  moving  incredibly  fast <comma> and  holds  a  lot  in  store  for  the  future <period> thanks  very  much <period> /transcript <period> i  'm  here  to  talk  about  the  wonder  and  the  mystery  of  conscious  minds <period> the  wonder  is  about  the  fact  that  we  all  woke  up  this  morning  and  we  had  with  it  the  amazing  return  of  our  conscious  mind <period> we  recovered  minds  with  a  complete  sense  of  self  and  a  complete  sense  of  our  own  existence <comma> yet  we  hardly  ever  pause  to  consider  this  wonder <period> we  should <comma> in  fact <comma> because  without  having  this  possibility  of  conscious  minds <comma> we  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  our  humanity <period> we  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  the  world <period> we  would  have  no  pains <comma> but  also  no  joys <period> we  would  have  no  access  to  love  or  to  the  ability  to  create <period> and  of  course <comma> scott  fitzgerald  said  famously  that  he  who  invented  consciousness  would  have  a  lot  to  be  blamed  for  but  he  also  forgot  that  without  consciousness <comma> he  would  have  no  access  to  true  happiness  and  even  the  possibility  of  transcendence <period> so  much  for  the  wonder <comma> now  for  the  mystery <period> this  is  a  mystery  that  has  really  been  extremely  hard  to  elucidate <period> all  the  way  back  into  early  philosophy  and  certainly  throughout  the  history  of  neuroscience <comma> this  has  been  one  mystery  that  has  always  resisted  elucidation <comma> has  got  major  controversies <period> and  there  are  actually  many  people  that  think  we  should  not  even  touch  it <period> we  should  just  leave  it  alone <comma> it  's  not  to  be  solved <period> i  do  n't  believe  that <comma> and  i  think  the  situation  is  changing <period> it  would  be  ridiculous  to  claim  that  we  know  how  we  make  consciousness  in  our  brains <comma> but  we  certainly  can  begin  to  approach  the  question <comma> and  we  can  begin  to  see  the  shape  of  a  solution <period> and  one  more  wonder  to  celebrate  is  the  fact  that  we  have  imaging  technologies  that  now  allow  us  to  go  inside  the  human  brain  and  be  able  to  do <comma> for  example <comma> what  you  're  seeing  right  now <period> these  are  images  that  come  from  hanna  damasio  's  lab <comma> and  which  show  you <comma> in  a  living  brain <comma> the  reconstruction  of  that  brain <period> and  this  is  a  person  who  is  alive <period> this  is  not  a  person  that  is  being  studied  at  autopsy <period> and  even  more <comma> and  this  is  something  that  one  can  be  really  amazed  about <comma> is  what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  next <comma> which  is  going  underneath  the  surface  of  the  brain  and  actually  looking  in  the  living  brain  at  real  connections <comma> real  pathways <period> so  all  of  those  colored  lines  correspond  to  bunches  of  axons <comma> the  fibers  that  join  cell  bodies  to  synapses <period> and  i  'm  sorry  to  disappoint  you <comma> they  do  n't  come  in  color <period> but  at  any  rate <comma> they  are  there <period> the  colors  are  codes  for  the  direction <comma> from  whether  it  is  back  to  front  or  vice  versa <period> at  any  rate <comma> what  is  consciousness <questionmark> what  is  a  conscious  mind <questionmark> and  we  could  take  a  very  simple  view  and  say <comma> well <comma> it  is  that  which  we  lose  when  we  fall  into  deep  sleep  without  dreams <comma> or  when  we  go  under  anesthesia <comma> and  it  is  what  we  regain  when  we  recover  from  sleep  or  from  anesthesia <period> but  what  is  exactly  that  stuff  that  we  lose  under  anesthesia <comma> or  when  we  are  in  deep <comma> dreamless  sleep <questionmark> well  first  of  all <comma> it  is  a  mind <comma> which  is  a  flow  of  mental  images <period> and  of  course  consider  images  that  can  be  sensory  patterns <comma> visual <comma> such  as  you  're  having  right  now  in  relation  to  the  stage  and  me <comma> or  auditory  images <comma> as  you  are  having  now  in  relation  to  my  words <period> that  flow  of  mental  images  is  mind <period> but  there  is  something  else  that  we  are  all  experiencing  in  this  room <period> we  are  not  passive  exhibitors  of  visual  or  auditory  or  tactile  images <period> we  have  selves <period> we  have  a  me  that  is  automatically  present  in  our  minds  right  now <period> we  own  our  minds <period> and  we  have  a  sense  that  it  's  everyone  of  us  that  is  experiencing  this <comma> not  the  person  who  is  sitting  next  to  you <period> so  in  order  to  have  a  conscious  mind <comma> you  have  a  self  within  the  conscious  mind <period> so  a  conscious  mind  is  a  mind  with  a  self  in  it <period> the  self  introduces  the  subjective  perspective  in  the  mind <comma> and  we  are  only  fully  conscious  when  self  comes  to  mind <period> so  what  we  need  to  know  to  even  address  this  mystery  is <comma> number  one <comma> how  are  minds  are  put  together  in  the  brain <comma> and <comma> number  two <comma> how  selves  are  constructed <period> now  the  first  part <comma> the  first  problem <comma> is  relatively  easy <comma> it  's  not  easy  at  all <comma> but  it  is  something  that  has  been  approached  gradually  in  neuroscience <period> and  it  's  quite  clear  that <comma> in  order  to  make  minds <comma> we  need  to  construct  neural  maps <period> so  imagine  a  grid <comma> like  the  one  i  'm  showing  you  right  now <comma> and  now  imagine <comma> within  that  grid <comma> that  two-dimensional  sheet <comma> imagine  neurons <period> and  picture <comma> if  you  will <comma> a  billboard <comma> a  digital  billboard <comma> where  you  have  elements  that  can  be  either  lit  or  not <period> and  depending  on  how  you  create  the  pattern  of  lighting  or  not  lighting <comma> the  digital  elements <comma> or <comma> for  that  matter <comma> the  neurons  in  the  sheet <comma> you  're  going  to  be  able  to  construct  a  map <period> this <comma> of  course <comma> is  a  visual  map  that  i  'm  showing  you <comma> but  this  applies  to  any  kind  of  map <comma> auditory <comma> for  example <comma> in  relation  to  sound  frequencies <comma> or  to  the  maps  that  we  construct  with  our  skin  in  relation  to  an  object  that  we  palpate <period> now  to  bring  home  the  point  of  how  close  it  is <comma> the  relationship  between  the  grid  of  neurons  and  the  topographical  arrangement  of  the  activity  of  the  neurons  and  our  mental  experience <comma> i  'm  going  to  tell  you  a  personal  story <period> so  if  i  cover  my  left  eye <comma> i  'm  talking  about  me  personally <comma> not  all  of  you <comma> if  i  cover  my  left  eye <comma> i  look  at  the  grid <comma> pretty  much  like  the  one  i  'm  showing  you <period> everything  is  nice  and  fine  and  perpendicular <period> but  sometime  ago <comma> i  discovered  that  if  i  cover  my  left  eye <comma> instead  what  i  get  is  this <period> i  look  at  the  grid  and  i  see  a  warping  at  the  edge  of  my  central-left  field <period> very  odd <comma> i've  analyzed  this  for  a  while <period> but  sometime  ago <comma> through  the  help  of  an  opthamologist  colleague  of  mine <comma> carmen  puliafito <comma> who  developed  a  laser  scanner  of  the  retina <comma> i  found  out  the  the  following <period> if  i  scan  my  retina  through  the  horizontal  plane  that  you  see  there  in  the  little  corner <comma> what  i  get  is  the  following <period> on  the  right  side <comma> my  retina  is  perfectly  symmetrical <period> you  see  the  going  down  towards  the  fovea  where  the  optic  nerve  begins <period> but  on  my  left  retina  there  is  a  bump <comma> which  is  marked  there  by  the  red  arrow <period> and  it  corresponds  to  a  little  cyst  that  is  located  below <period> and  that  is  exactly  what  causes  the  warping  of  my  visual  image <period> so  just  think  of  this <comma> you  have  a  grid  of  neurons <comma> and  now  you  have  a  plane  mechanical  change  in  the  position  of  the  grid <comma> and  you  get  a  warping  of  your  mental  experience <period> so  this  is  how  close  your  mental  experience  and  the  activity  of  the  neurons  in  the  retina <comma> which  is  a  part  of  the  brain  located  in  the  eyeball <comma> or <comma> for  that  matter <comma> a  sheet  of  visual  cortex <period> so  from  the  retina  you  go  onto  visual  cortex <period> and  of  course <comma> the  brain  adds  on  a  lot  of  information  to  what  is  going  on  in  the  signals  that  come  from  the  retina <period> and  in  that  image  there <comma> you  see  a  variety  of  islands  of  what  i  call  image-making  regions  in  the  brain <period> you  have  the  green  for  example <comma> that  corresponds  to  tactile  information <comma> or  the  blue  that  corresponds  to  auditory  information <period> and  something  else  that  happens  is  that  those  image-making  regions  where  you  have  the  plotting  of  all  these  neural  maps <comma> can  then  provide  signals  to  this  ocean  of  purple  that  you  see  around <comma> which  is  the  association  cortex <period> where  you  can  make  records  of  what  went  on  in  those  islands  of  image-making <period> and  the  great  beauty  is  that  you  can  then  go  from  memory <comma> out  of  those  association  cortices <comma> and  produce  back  images  in  the  very  same  regions  that  have  perception <period> so  think  about  how  wonderfully  convenient  and  lazy  the  brain  is <period> so  it  provides  certain  areas  for  perception  and  image-making <period> and  those  are  exactly  the  same  that  are  going  to  be  used  for  image-making  when  we  recall  information <period> so  far  the  mystery  of  the  conscious  mind  is  diminishing  a  little  bit  because  we  have  a  general  sense  of  how  we  make  these  images <period> but  what  about  the  self <questionmark> the  self  is  really  the  elusive  problem <period> and  for  a  long  time <comma> people  did  not  even  want  to  touch  it <comma> because  they'd  say <comma> how  can  you  have  this  reference  point <comma> this  stability <comma> that  is  required  to  maintain  the  continuity  of  selves  day  after  day  and  i  thought  about  a  solution  to  this  problem <period> it  's  the  following <period> we  generate  brain  maps  of  the  body  's  interior  and  use  them  as  the  reference  for  all  other  maps <period> so  let  me  tell  you  just  a  little  bit  about  how  i  came  to  this <period> i  came  to  this  because <comma> if  you  're  going  to  have  a  reference  that  we  know  as  self <comma> the  me <comma> the  i  in  our  own  processing <comma> we  need  to  have  something  that  is  stable <comma> something  that  does  not  deviate  much  from  day  to  day <period> well  it  so  happens  that  we  have  a  singular  body <period> we  have  one  body <comma> not  two <comma> not  three <period> and  so  that  is  a  beginning <period> there  is  just  one  reference  point <comma> which  is  the  body <period> but  then <comma> of  course <comma> the  body  has  many  parts <comma> and  things  grow  at  different  rates <comma> and  they  have  different  sizes  and  different  people <period> however <comma> not  so  with  the  interior <period> the  things  that  have  to  do  with  what  is  known  as  our  internal  milieu <comma> for  example <comma> the  whole  management  of  the  chemistries  within  our  body  are <comma> in  fact <comma> extremely  maintained  day  after  day  for  one  very  good  reason <period> if  you  deviate  too  much  in  the  parameters  that  are  close  to  the  midline  of  that  life-permitting  survival  range <comma> you  go  into  disease  or  death <period> so  we  have  an  in-built  system  within  our  own  lives  that  ensures  some  kind  of  continuity <period> i  like  to  call  it  an  almost  infinite  sameness  from  day  to  day <period> because  if  you  do  n't  have  that  sameness <comma> physiologically <comma> you  're  going  to  be  sick  or  you  're  going  to  die <period> so  that  's  one  more  element  for  this  continuity <period> and  the  final  thing  is  that  there  is  a  very  tight  coupling  between  the  regulation  of  our  body  within  the  brain  and  the  body  itself <comma> unlike  any  other  coupling <period> so  for  example <comma> i  'm  making  images  of  you <comma> but  there  's  no  physiological  bond  between  the  images  i  have  of  you  as  an  audience  and  my  brain <period> however <comma> there  is  a  close <comma> permanently  maintained  bond  between  the  body  regulating  parts  of  my  brain  and  my  own  body <period> so  here  's  how  it  looks <period> look  at  the  region  there <period> there  is  the  brain  stem  in  between  the  cerebral  cortex  and  the  spinal  cord <period> and  it  is  within  that  region  that  i  'm  going  to  highlight  now  that  we  have  this  housing  of  all  the  life-regulation  devices  of  the  body <period> this  is  so  specific  that <comma> for  example <comma> if  you  look  at  the  part  that  is  covered  in  red  in  the  upper  part  of  the  brain  stem <comma> if  you  damage  that  as  a  result  of  a  stroke <comma> for  example <comma> what  you  get  is  coma  or  vegetative  state <comma> which  is  a  state <comma> of  course <comma> in  which  your  mind  disappears <comma> your  consciousness  disappears <period> what  happens  then  actually  is  that  you  lose  the  grounding  of  the  self <comma> you  have  no  longer  access  to  any  feeling  of  your  own  existence <comma> and <comma> in  fact <comma> there  can  be  images  going  on <comma> being  formed  in  the  cerebral  cortex <comma> except  you  do  n't  know  they  're  there <period> you  have <comma> in  effect <comma> lost  consciousness  when  you  have  damage  to  that  red  section  of  the  brain  stem <period> but  if  you  consider  the  green  part  of  the  brain  stem <comma> nothing  like  that  happens <period> it  is  that  specific <period> so  in  that  green  component  of  the  brain  stem <comma> if  you  damage  it <comma> and  often  it  happens <comma> what  you  get  is  complete  paralysis <comma> but  your  conscious  mind  is  maintained <period> you  feel <comma> you  know <comma> you  have  a  fully  conscious  mind  that  you  can  report  very  indirectly <period> this  is  a  horrific  condition <period> you  do  n't  want  to  see  it <period> and  people  are <comma> in  fact <comma> imprisoned  within  their  own  bodies <comma> but  they  do  have  a  mind <period> there  was  a  very  interesting  film <comma> one  of  the  rare  good  films  done  about  a  situation  like  this <comma> by  julian  schnabel  some  years  ago  about  a  patient  that  was  in  that  condition <period> so  now  i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  picture <period> i  promise  not  to  say  anything  about  this <comma> except  this  is  to  frighten  you <period> it  's  just  to  tell  you  that  in  that  red  section  of  the  brain  stem <comma> there  are <comma> to  make  it  simple <comma> all  those  little  squares  that  correspond  to  modules  that  actually  make  brain  maps  of  different  aspects  of  our  interior <comma> different  aspects  of  our  body <period> they  are  exquisitely  topographic  and  they  are  exquisitely  interconnected  in  a  recursive  pattern <period> and  it  is  out  of  this  and  out  of  this  tight  coupling  between  the  brain  stem  and  the  body  that  i  believe <comma> and  i  could  be  wrong <comma> but  i  do  n't  think  i  am <comma> that  you  generate  this  mapping  of  the  body  that  provides  the  grounding  for  the  self  and  that  comes  in  the  form  of  feelings <comma> primordial  feelings <comma> by  the  way <period> so  what  is  the  picture  that  we  get  here <questionmark> look  at  cerebral  cortex <comma> look  at  brain  stem <comma> look  at  body <comma> and  you  get  the  picture  of  the  interconnectivity  in  which  you  have  the  brain  stem  providing  the  grounding  for  the  self  in  a  very  tight  interconnection  with  the  body <period> and  you  have  the  cerebral  cortex  providing  the  great  spectacle  of  our  minds  with  the  profusion  of  images  that  are <comma> in  fact <comma> the  contents  of  our  minds  and  that  we  normally  pay  most  attention  to <comma> as  we  should <comma> because  that  's  really  the  film  that  is  rolling  in  our  minds <period> but  look  at  the  arrows <period> they  're  not  there  for  looks <period> they  're  there  because  there  's  this  very  close  interaction <period> you  cannot  have  a  conscious  mind  if  you  do  n't  have  the  interaction  between  cerebral  cortex  and  brain  stem <period> you  cannot  have  a  conscious  mind  if  you  do  n't  have  the  interaction  between  the  brain  stem  and  the  body <period> another  thing  that  is  interesting  is  that  the  brain  stem  that  we  have  is  shared  with  a  variety  of  other  species <period> so  throughout  vertebrates <comma> the  design  of  the  brain  stem  is  very  similar  to  ours <comma> which  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  i  think  those  other  species  have  conscious  minds  like  we  do <period> except  that  they  're  not  as  rich  as  ours <comma> because  they  do  n't  have  a  cerebral  cortex  like  we  do <period> that  's  where  the  difference  is <period> and  i  strongly  disagree  with  the  idea  that  consciousness  should  be  considered  as  the  great  product  of  the  cerebral  cortex <period> only  the  wealth  of  our  minds  is <comma> not  the  very  fact  that  we  have  a  self  that  we  can  refer  to  our  own  existence <comma> and  that  we  have  any  sense  of  person <period> now  there  are  three  levels  of  self  to  consider <comma> the  proto <comma> the  core  and  the  autobiographical <period> the  first  two  are  shared  with  many <comma> many  other  species <comma> and  they  are  really  coming  out  largely  of  the  brain  stem  and  whatever  there  is  of  cortex  in  those  species <period> it  's  the  autobiographical  self  which  some  species  have <comma> i  think <period> cetaceans  and  primates  have  also  an  autobiographical  self  to  a  certain  degree <period> and  everybody  's  dogs  at  home  have  an  autobiographical  self  to  a  certain  degree <period> but  the  novelty  is  here <period> the  autobiographical  self  is  built  on  the  basis  of  past  memories  and  memories  of  the  plans  that  we  have  made <period> it  's  the  lived  past  and  the  anticipated  future <period> and  the  autobiographical  self  has  prompted  extended  memory <comma> reasoning <comma> imagination <comma> creativity  and  language <period> and  out  of  that  came  the  instruments  of  culture <comma> religions <comma> justice <comma> trade <comma> the  arts <comma> science <comma> technology <period> and  it  is  within  that  culture  that  we  really  can  get <comma> and  this  is  the  novelty <comma> something  that  is  not  entirely  set  by  our  biology <period> it  is  developed  in  the  cultures <period> it  developed  in  collectives  of  human  beings <period> and  this  is <comma> of  course <comma> the  culture  where  we  have  developed  something  that  i  like  to  call  socio-cultural  regulation <period> and  finally <comma> you  could  rightly  ask <comma> why  care  about  this <questionmark> why  care  if  it  is  the  brain  stem  or  the  cerebral  cortex  and  how  this  is  made <questionmark> three  reasons <period> first <comma> curiosity <period> primates  are  extremely  curious <comma> and  humans  most  of  all <period> and  if  we  are  interested <comma> for  example <comma> in  the  fact  that  anti-gravity  is  pulling  galaxies  away  from  the  earth <comma> why  should  we  not  be  interested  in  what  is  going  on  inside  of  human  beings <questionmark> second <comma> understanding  society  and  culture <period> we  should  look  at  how  society  and  culture  in  this  socio-cultural  regulation  are  a  work  in  progress <period> and  finally <comma> medicine <period> let  's  not  forget  that  some  of  the  worst  diseases  of  humankind  are  diseases  such  as  depression <comma> alzheimer  's  disease <comma> drug  addiction <period> think  of  strokes  that  can  devastate  your  mind  or  render  you  unconscious <period> you  have  no  prayer  of  treating  those  diseases  effectively  and  in  a  non-serendipitous  way  if  you  do  not  know  how  this  works <period> so  that  's  a  very  good  reason  beyond  curiosity  to  justify  what  we  're  doing <comma> and  to  justify  having  some  interest  in  what  is  going  on  in  our  brains <period> thank  you  for  your  attention <period> do  you  remember  the  story  of  odysseus  and  the  sirens  from  high  school  or  junior  high  school <questionmark> there  was  this  hero <comma> odysseus <comma> who  's  heading  back  home  after  the  trojan  war <period> and  he  's  standing  on  the  deck  of  his  ship <comma> he  's  talking  to  his  first  mate <comma> and  he  's  saying <comma> tomorrow <comma> we  will  sail  past  those  rocks <comma> and  on  those  rocks  sit  some  beautiful  women  called  sirens <period> and  these  women  sing  an  enchanting  song <comma> a  song  so  alluring  that  all  sailors  who  hear  it  crash  into  the  rocks  and  die  now  you  would  expect <comma> given  that <comma> that  they  would  choose  an  alternate  route  around  the  sirens <comma> but  instead  odysseus  says <comma> i  want  to  hear  that  song <period> and  so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is  i  'm  going  to  pour  wax  in  the  ears  of  you  and  all  the  men <comma> stay  with  me <comma> so  that  you  cannot  hear  the  song <comma> and  then  i  'm  going  to  have  you  tie  me  to  the  mast  so  that  i  can  listen  and  we  can  all  sail  by  unaffected <period> so  this  is  a  captain  putting  the  life  of  every  single  person  on  the  ship  at  risk  so  that  he  can  hear  a  song <period> and  i'd  like  to  think  if  this  was  the  case <comma> they  probably  would  have  rehearsed  it  a  few  times <period> odysseus  would  have  said <comma> okay <comma> let  's  do  a  dry  run <period> you  tie  me  to  the  mast <comma> and  i  'm  going  to  beg  and  plead <period> and  no  matter  what  i  say <comma> you  cannot  untie  me  from  the  mast <period> all  right <comma> so  tie  me  to  the  mast  and  the  first  mate  takes  a  rope  and  ties  odysseus  to  the  mast  in  a  nice  knot <period> and  odysseus  does  his  best  job  playacting  and  says <comma> untie  me <period> untie  me <period> i  want  to  hear  that  song <period> untie  me  and  the  first  mate  wisely  resists  and  does  n't  untie  odysseus <period> and  then  odysseus  says <comma> i  see  that  you  can  get  it <period> all  right <comma> untie  me  now  and  we  'll  get  some  dinner  and  the  first  mate  hesitates <period> he  's  like <comma> is  this  still  the  rehearsal <comma> or  should  i  untie  him  and  the  first  mate  thinks <comma> well <comma> i  guess  at  some  point  the  rehearsal  has  to  end <period> so  he  unties  odysseus <comma> and  odysseus  flips  out <period> he  's  like <comma> you  idiot <period> you  moron <period> if  you  do  that  tomorrow <comma> i  'll  be  dead <comma> you  'll  be  dead <comma> every  single  one  of  the  men  will  be  dead <period> now  just  do  n't  untie  me  no  matter  what <period> he  throws  the  first  mate  to  the  ground <period> this  repeats  itself  through  the  night <comma> rehearsal <comma> tying  to  the  mast <comma> conning  his  way  out  of  it <comma> beating  the  poor  first  mate  up  mercilessly <period> hilarity  ensues <period> tying  yourself  to  a  mast  is  perhaps  the  oldest  written  example  of  what  psychologists  call  a  commitment  device <period> a  commitment  device  is  a  decision  that  you  make  with  a  cool  head  to  bind  yourself  so  that  you  do  n't  do  something  regrettable  when  you  have  a  hot  head <period> because  there  's  two  heads  inside  one  person  when  you  think  about  it <period> scholars  have  long  invoked  this  metaphor  of  two  selves  when  it  comes  to  questions  of  temptation <period> there  is  first <comma> the  present  self <period> this  is  like  odysseus  when  he  's  hearing  the  song <period> he  just  wants  to  get  to  the  front  row <period> he  just  thinks  about  the  here  and  now  and  the  immediate  gratification <period> but  then  there  's  this  other  self <comma> the  future  self <period> this  is  odysseus  as  an  old  man  who  wants  nothing  more  than  to  retire  in  a  sunny  villa  with  his  wife  penelope  outside  of  ithaca <comma> the  other  one <period> so  why  do  we  need  commitment  devices <questionmark> well  resisting  temptation  is  hard <comma> as  the  19th  century  english  economist  nassau  william  senior  said <comma> to  abstain  from  the  enjoyment  which  is  in  our  power <comma> or  to  seek  distant  rather  than  immediate  results <comma> are  among  the  most  painful  exertions  of  the  human  will  if  you  set  goals  for  yourself  and  you  're  like  a  lot  of  other  people <comma> you  probably  realize  it  's  not  that  your  goals  are  physically  impossible  that  's  keeping  you  from  achieving  them <comma> it  's  that  you  lack  the  self-discipline  to  stick  to  them <period> it  's  physically  possible  to  lose  weight <period> it  's  physically  possible  to  exercise  more <period> but  resisting  temptation  is  hard <period> the  other  reason  that  it  's  difficult  to  resist  temptation  is  because  it  's  an  unequal  battle  between  the  present  self  and  the  future  self <period> i  mean <comma> let  's  face  it <comma> the  present  self  is  present <period> it  's  in  control <period> it  's  in  power  right  now <period> it  has  these  strong <comma> heroic  arms  that  can  lift  doughnuts  into  your  mouth <period> and  the  future  self  is  not  even  around <period> it  's  off  in  the  future <period> it  's  weak <period> it  does  n't  even  have  a  lawyer  present <period> there  's  nobody  to  stick  up  for  the  future  self <period> and  so  the  present  self  can  trounce  all  over  its  dreams <period> so  there  's  this  battle  between  the  two  selves  that  's  being  fought <comma> and  we  need  commitment  devices  to  level  the  playing  field  between  the  two <period> now  i  'm  a  big  fan  of  commitment  devices  actually <period> tying  yourself  to  the  mast  is  the  oldest  one <comma> but  there  are  other  ones  such  as  locking  a  credit  card  away  with  a  key  or  not  bringing  junk  food  into  the  house  so  you  wo  n't  eat  it  or  unplugging  your  internet  connection  so  you  can  use  your  computer <period> i  was  creating  commitment  devices  of  my  own  long  before  i  knew  what  they  were <period> so  when  i  was  a  starving  post-doc  at  columbia  university <comma> i  was  deep  in  a  publish-or-perish  phase  of  my  career <period> i  had  to  write  five  pages  a  day  towards  papers  or  i  would  have  to  give  up  five  dollars <period> and  when  you  try  to  execute  these  commitment  devices <comma> you  realize  the  devil  is  really  in  the  details <period> because  it  's  not  that  easy  to  get  rid  of  five  dollars <period> i  mean <comma> you  cannot  burn  it <period> that  's  illegal <period> and  i  thought <comma> well  i  could  give  it  to  a  charity  or  give  it  to  my  wife  or  something  like  that <period> but  then  i  thought <comma> oh <comma> i  'm  sending  myself  mixed  messages <period> because  not  writing  is  bad <comma> but  giving  to  charity  is  good <period> so  then  i  would  kind  of  justify  not  writing  by  giving  a  gift <period> and  then  i  kind  of  flipped  that  around  and  thought <comma> well  i  could  give  it  to  the  neo-nazis <period> but  then  i  was  like <comma> that  's  more  bad  than  writing  is  good <comma> and  so  that  would  n't  work <period> so  ultimately <comma> i  just  decided  i  would  leave  it  in  an  envelope  on  the  subway <period> sometimes  a  good  person  would  find  it <comma> sometimes  a  bad  person  would  find  it <period> on  average <comma> it  was  just  a  completely  pointless  exchange  of  money  that  i  would  regret <period> such  it  is  with  commitment  devices <period> but  despite  my  like  for  them <comma> there  's  two  nagging  concerns  that  i've  always  had  about  commitment  devices <comma> and  you  might  feel  this  if  you  use  them  yourself <period> so  the  first  is <comma> when  you've  got  one  of  these  devices  going <comma> such  as  this  contract  to  write  everyday  or  pay <comma> it  's  just  a  constant  reminder  that  you  have  no  self-control <period> you  're  just  telling  yourself <comma> without  you <comma> commitment  device <comma> i  am  nothing <comma> i  have  no  self-discipline  and  then  when  you  're  ever  in  a  situation  where  you  do  n't  have  a  commitment  device  in  place <comma> like <comma> oh  my  god <comma> that  person  's  offering  me  a  doughnut <comma> and  i  have  no  defense  mechanism, <comma> you  just  eat  it <period> so  i  do  n't  like  the  way  that  they  take  the  power  away  from  you <period> i  think  self-discipline  is  something <comma> it  's  like  a  muscle <period> the  more  you  exercise  it <comma> the  stronger  it  gets <period> the  other  problem  with  commitment  devices  is  that  you  can  always  weasel  your  way  out  of  them <period> you  say <comma> well <comma> of  course  i  cannot  write  today <comma> because  i  'm  giving  a  tedtalk  and  i  have  five  media  interviews <comma> and  then  i  'm  going  to  a  cocktail  party  and  then  i  'll  be  drunk  after  that <period> and  so  there  's  no  way  that  this  is  going  to  work  so  in  effect <comma> you  are  like  odysseus  and  the  first  mate  in  one  person <period> you  're  putting  yourself <comma> you  're  binding  yourself <comma> and  you  're  weaseling  your  way  out  of  it <comma> and  then  you  're  beating  yourself  up  afterwards <period> so  i've  been  working  for  about  a  decade  now  on  finding  other  ways  to  change  people  's  relationship  to  the  future  self  without  using  commitment  devices <period> in  particular <comma> i  'm  interested  in  the  relationship  to  the  future  financial  self <period> and  this  is  a  timely  issue <period> i  'm  talking  about  the  topic  of  saving <period> now  saving  is  a  classic  two  selves  problem <period> the  present  self  does  not  want  to  save  at  all <period> it  wants  to  consume <period> whereas  the  future  self  wants  the  present  self  to  save <period> so  this  is  a  timely  problem <period> we  look  at  the  savings  rate  and  it  has  been  declining  since  the  1950s <period> at  the  same  time <comma> the  retirement  risk  index <comma> the  chance  of  not  being  able  to  meet  your  needs  in  retirement <comma> has  been  increasing <period> and  we  're  at  a  situation  now  where  for  every  three  baby  boomers <comma> the  mckinsey  global  institute  predicts  that  two  will  not  be  able  to  meet  their  pre-retirement  needs  while  they  're  in  retirement <period> so  what  can  we  do  about  this <questionmark> there  's  a  philosopher <comma> derek  parfit <comma> who  said  some  words  that  were  inspiring  to  my  coauthors  and  i <period> he  said  that <comma> we  might  neglect  our  future  selves  because  of  some  failure  of  belief  or  imagination <period> that  is  to  say <comma> we  somehow  might  not  believe  that  we  're  going  to  get  old <comma> or  we  might  not  be  able  to  imagine  that  we  're  going  to  get  old  some  day <period> on  the  one  hand <comma> it  sounds  ridiculous <period> of  course <comma> we  know  that  we  're  going  to  get  old <period> but  are  n't  there  things  that  we  believe  and  do  n't  believe  at  the  same  time <questionmark> so  my  coauthors  and  i  have  used  computers <comma> the  greatest  tool  of  our  time <comma> to  assist  people  's  imagination  and  help  them  imagine  what  it  might  be  like  to  go  into  the  future <period> and  i  'll  show  you  some  of  these  tools  right  here <period> the  first  is  called  the  distribution  builder <period> it  shows  people  what  the  future  might  be  like  by  showing  them  a  hundred  equally  probable  outcomes  that  might  be  obtained  in  the  future <period> each  outcome  is  shown  by  one  of  these  markers <comma> and  each  sits  on  a  row  that  represents  a  level  of  wealth  and  retirement <period> being  up  at  the  top  means  that  you  're  enjoying  a  high  income  in  retirement <period> being  down  at  the  bottom  means  that  you  're  struggling  to  make  ends  meet <period> when  you  make  an  investment <comma> what  you  're  really  saying  is <comma> i  accept  that  any  one  of  these  100  things  could  happen  to  me  and  determine  my  wealth  now  you  can  try  to  move  your  outcomes  around <period> you  can  try  to  manipulate  your  fate <comma> like  this  person  is  doing <comma> but  it  costs  you  something  to  do  it <period> it  means  that  you  have  to  save  more  today <period> once  you  find  an  investment  that  you  're  happy  with <comma> what  people  do  is  they  click  done  and  the  markers  begin  to  disappear <comma> slowly <comma> one  by  one <period> it  simulates  what  it  is  like  to  invest  in  something  and  to  watch  that  investment  pan  out <period> at  the  end <comma> there  will  only  be  one  marker  left  standing  and  it  will  determine  our  wealth  in  retirement <period> yes <comma> this  person  retired  at  150  percent  of  their  working  income  in  retirement <period> they  're  making  more  money  while  retired  than  they  were  making  while  they  were  working <period> if  you  're  like  most  people <comma> just  seeing  that  gave  you  a  small  sense  of  elation  and  joy <comma> just  to  think  about  making  50  percent  more  money  in  retirement  than  before <period> however <comma> had  you  ended  up  on  the  very  bottom <comma> it  might  have  given  you  a  slight  sense  of  dread  and/or  nausea  thinking  about  struggling  to  get  by  in  retirement <period> by  using  this  tool  over  and  over  and  simulating  outcome  after  outcome <comma> people  can  understand  that  the  investments  and  savings  that  they  undertake  today  determine  their  well-being  in  the  future <period> now  people  are  motivated  through  emotions <comma> but  different  people  find  different  things  motivating <period> this  is  a  simulation  that  uses  graphics <comma> but  other  people  find  motivating  what  money  can  buy <comma> not  just  numbers <period> so  here  i  made  a  distribution  builder  where  instead  of  showing  numerical  outcomes <comma> i  show  people  what  those  outcomes  will  get  you <comma> in  particular  apartments  that  you  can  afford  if  you  're  retiring  on  3,000 <comma> 2,500 <comma> 2,000  dollars  per  month  and  so  on <period> as  you  move  down  the  ladder  of  apartments <comma> you  see  that  they  get  worse  and  worse <period> some  of  them  look  like  places  i  lived  in  as  a  graduate  student <period> and  as  you  get  to  the  very  bottom <comma> you  're  faced  with  the  unfortunate  reality  that  if  you  do  n't  save  anything  for  retirement <comma> you  wo  n't  be  able  to  afford  any  housing  at  all <period> those  are  actual  pictures  of  actual  apartments  renting  for  that  amount  as  advertised  on  the  internet <period> the  last  thing  i  'll  show  you <comma> the  last  behavioral  time  machine <comma> is  something  that  i  created  with  hal  hershfield <comma> who  was  introduced  to  me  by  my  coauthor  on  a  previous  project <comma> bill  sharpe <period> and  what  it  is  is  an  exploration  into  virtual  reality <period> so  what  we  do  is  we  take  pictures  of  people <comma> in  this  case <comma> college-age  people <comma> and  we  use  software  to  age  them  and  show  these  people  what  they  'll  look  like  when  they  're  60 <comma> 70 <comma> 80  years  old <period> and  we  try  to  test  whether  actually  assisting  your  imagination  by  looking  at  the  face  of  your  future  self  can  change  you  investment  behavior <period> so  this  is  one  of  our  experiments <period> here  we  see  the  face  of  the  young  subject  on  the  left <period> he  's  given  a  control  that  allows  him  to  adjust  his  savings  rate <period> as  he  moves  his  savings  rate  down <comma> it  means  that  he  's  saving  zero  when  it  's  all  the  way  here  at  the  left <period> you  can  see  his  current  annual  income <comma> this  is  the  percentage  of  his  paycheck  that  he  can  take  home  today <comma> is  quite  high <comma> 91  percent <comma> but  his  retirement  income  is  quite  low <period> he  's  going  to  retire  on  44  percent  of  what  he  earned  while  he  was  working <period> if  he  saves  the  maximum  legal  amount <comma> his  retirement  income  goes  up <comma> but  he  's  unhappy  because  now  he  has  less  money  on  the  left-hand  side  to  spend  today <period> other  conditions  show  people  the  future  self <period> and  from  the  future  self  's  point  of  view <comma> everything  is  in  reverse <period> if  you  save  very  little <comma> the  future  self  is  unhappy  living  on  44  percent  of  the  income <period> whereas  if  the  present  self  saves  a  lot <comma> the  future  self  is  delighted <comma> where  the  income  is  close  up  near  100  percent <period> to  bring  this  to  a  wider  audience <comma> i've  been  working  with  hal  and  allianz  to  create  something  we  call  the  behavioral  time  machine <comma> in  which  you  not  only  get  to  see  yourself  in  the  future <comma> but  you  get  to  see  anticipated  emotional  reactions  to  different  levels  of  retirement  wealth <period> so  for  instance <comma> here  is  somebody  using  the  tool <period> and  just  watch  the  facial  expressions  as  they  move  the  slider <period> the  younger  face  gets  happier  and  happier <comma> saving  nothing <period> the  older  face  is  miserable <period> and  slowly <comma> slowly  we  're  bringing  it  up  to  a  moderate  savings  rate <period> and  then  it  's  a  high  savings  rate <period> the  younger  face  is  getting  unhappy <period> the  older  face  is  quite  pleased  with  the  decision <period> we  're  going  to  see  if  this  has  an  effect  on  what  people  do <period> and  what  's  nice  about  it  is  it  's  not  something  that  biasing  people  actually <comma> because  as  one  face  smiles <comma> the  other  face  frowns <period> it  's  not  telling  you  which  way  to  put  the  slider <comma> it  's  just  reminding  you  that  you  are  connected  to  and  legally  tied  to  this  future  self <period> your  decisions  today  are  going  to  determine  its  well-being <period> and  that  's  something  that  's  easy  to  forget <period> this  use  of  virtual  reality  is  not  just  good  for  making  people  look  older <period> there  are  programs  you  can  get  to  see  how  people  might  look  if  they  smoke <comma> if  they  get  too  much  exposure  to  the  sun <comma> if  they  gain  weight  and  so  on <period> and  what  's  good  is <comma> unlike  in  the  experiments  that  hal  and  myself  ran  with  russ  smith <comma> you  do  n't  have  to  program  these  by  yourself  in  order  to  see  the  virtual  reality <period> there  are  applications  you  can  get  on  smartphones  for  just  a  few  dollars  that  do  the  same  thing <period> this  is  actually  a  picture  of  hal <comma> my  coauthor <period> you  might  recognize  him  from  the  previous  demos <period> and  just  for  kicks  we  ran  his  picture  through  the  balding <comma> aging  and  weight  gain  software  to  see  how  he  would  look <period> hal  is  here <comma> so  i  think  we  owe  it  to  him  as  well  as  yourself  to  disabuse  you  of  that  last  image <period> and  i  'll  close  it  there <period> on  behalf  of  hal  and  myself <comma> i  wish  all  the  best  to  your  present  and  future  selves <period> thank  you <period> let  me  introduce  to  you  rezero <period> this  little  fellow  was  developed  by  a  group  of  10  undergraduate  students  at  the  autonomous  systems  laboratory  at  eth-zurich <period> our  robot  belongs  to  a  family  of  robots  called  ballbots <period> instead  of  wheels <comma> a  ballbot  is  balancing  and  moving  on  one  single  ball <period> the  main  characteristics  of  such  a  system  is  that  there  's  one  sole  contact  point  to  the  ground <period> this  means  that  the  robot  is  inherently  unstable <period> it  's  like  when  i  am  trying  to  stand  on  one  foot <period> you  might  ask  yourself <comma> what  's  the  usefulness  of  a  robot  that  's  unstable <questionmark> now  we  'll  explain  that  in  a  second <period> let  me  first  explain  how  rezero  actually  keeps  his  balance <period> rezero  keeps  his  balance  by  constantly  measuring  his  pitch  angle  with  a  sensor <period> he  then  counteracts  and  avoids  toppling  over  by  turning  the  motors  appropriately <period> this  happens  160  times  per  second <comma> and  if  anything  fails  in  this  process <comma> rezero  would  immediately  fall  to  the  ground <period> now  to  move  and  to  balance <comma> rezero  needs  to  turn  the  ball <period> the  ball  is  driven  by  three  special  wheels  that  allow  rezero  to  move  into  any  direction  and  also  move  around  his  own  axis  at  the  same  time <period> due  to  his  instability <comma> rezero  is  always  in  motion <period> now  here  's  the  trick <period> it  's  indeed  exactly  this  instability  that  allows  a  robot  to  move  very  dynamically <period> let  's  play  a  little <period> you  may  have  wondered  what  happens  if  i  give  the  robot  a  little  push <period> in  this  mode <comma> he  's  trying  to  maintain  his  position <period> for  the  next  demo <comma> i'd  like  you  to  introduce  to  my  colleagues  michael <comma> on  the  computer <comma> and  thomas  who  's  helping  me  onstage <period> in  the  next  mode <comma> rezero  is  passive <comma> and  we  can  move  him  around <period> with  almost  no  force  i  can  control  his  position  and  his  velocity <period> i  can  also  make  him  spin <period> in  the  next  mode <comma> we  can  get  rezero  to  follow  a  person <period> he  's  now  keeping  a  constant  distance  to  thomas <period> this  works  with  a  laser  sensor  that  's  mounted  on  top  of  rezero <period> with  the  same  method <comma> we  can  also  get  him  to  circle  a  person <period> we  call  this  the  orbiting  mode <period> all  right <comma> thank  you <comma> thomas <period> now <comma> what  's  the  use  of  this  technology <questionmark> for  now <comma> it  's  an  experiment <comma> but  let  me  show  you  some  possible  future  applications <period> rezero  could  be  used  in  exhibitions  or  parks <period> with  a  screen  it  could  inform  people  or  show  them  around  in  a  fun  and  entertaining  way <period> in  a  hospital <comma> this  device  could  be  used  to  carry  around  medical  equipment <period> due  to  the  ballbot  system <comma> it  has  a  very  small  footprint  and  it  's  also  easy  to  move  around <period> and  of  course <comma> who  would  n't  like  to  take  a  ride  on  one  of  these <period> and  these  are  more  practical  applications <period> but  there  's  also  a  certain  beauty  within  this  technology <period> thank  you <period> thank  you <period> i  thought  in  getting  up  to  my  ted  wish  i  would  try  to  begin  by  putting  in  perspective  what  i  try  to  do  and  how  it  fits  with  what  they  try  to  do <period> we  live  in  a  world  that  everyone  knows  is  interdependent <comma> but  insufficient  in  three  major  ways <period> it  is <comma> first  of  all <comma> profoundly  unequal: <period> half  the  world  's  people  still  living  on  less  than  two  dollars  a  day <period> a  billion  people  with  no  access  to  clean  water <period> two  and  a  half  billion  no  access  to  sanitation <period> a  billion  going  to  bed  hungry  every  night <period> one  in  four  deaths  every  year  from  aids <comma> tb <comma> malaria  and  the  variety  of  infections  associated  with  dirty  water <comma> 80  percent  of  them  under  five  years  of  age <period> even  in  wealthy  countries  it  is  common  now  to  see  inequality  growing <period> in  the  united  states <comma> since  2001  we've  had  five  years  of  economic  growth <comma> five  years  of  productivity  growth  in  the  workplace <comma> but  median  wages  are  stagnant  and  the  percentage  of  working  families  dropping  below  the  poverty  line  is  up  by  four  percent <period> the  percentage  of  working  families  without  health  care  up  by  four  percent <period> so  this  interdependent  world  which  has  been  pretty  good  to  most  of  us <comma> which  is  why  we  're  all  here  in  northern  california  doing  what  we  do  for  a  living <comma> enjoying  this  evening <comma> is  profoundly  unequal <period> it  is  also  unstable <period> unstable  because  of  the  threats  of  terror <comma> weapons  of  mass  destruction <comma> the  spread  of  global  disease  and  a  sense  that  we  are  vulnerable  to  it  in  a  way  that  we  were  n't  not  so  many  years  ago <period> and  perhaps  most  important  of  all <comma> it  is  unsustainable  because  of  climate  change <comma> resource  depletion  and  species  destruction <period> when  i  think  about  the  world  i  would  like  to  leave  to  my  daughter  and  the  grandchildren  i  hope  to  have <comma> it  is  a  world  that  moves  away  from  unequal <comma> unstable <comma> unsustainable  interdependence  to  integrated  communities <comma> locally <comma> nationally  and  globally <comma> that  share  the  characteristics  of  all  successful  communities: <period> a  broadly  shared <comma> accessible  set  of  opportunities <comma> a  shared  sense  of  responsibility  for  the  success  of  the  common  enterprise  and  a  genuine  sense  of  belonging <period> all  easier  said  than  done <period> when  the  terrorist  incidents  occurred  in  the  united  kingdom  a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> i  think  even  though  they  did  n't  claim  as  many  lives  as  we  lost  in  the  united  states  on  9/11 <comma> i  think  the  thing  that  troubled  the  british  most  was  that  the  perpetrators  were  not  invaders <comma> but  homegrown  citizens  whose  religious  and  political  identities  were  more  important  to  them  than  the  people  they  grew  up  with <comma> went  to  school  with <comma> worked  with <comma> shared  weekends  with <comma> shared  meals  with <period> in  other  words <comma> they  thought  their  differences  were  more  important  than  their  common  humanity <period> it  is  the  central  psychological  plague  of  humankind  in  the  21st  century <period> into  this  mix <comma> people  like  us <comma> who  are  not  in  public  office <comma> have  more  power  to  do  good  than  at  any  time  in  history <comma> because  more  than  half  the  world  's  people  live  under  governments  they  voted  in  and  can  vote  out <period> and  even  non-democratic  governments  are  more  sensitive  to  public  opinion <period> because  primarily  of  the  power  of  the  internet <comma> people  of  modest  means  can  band  together  and  amass  vast  sums  of  money  that  can  change  the  world  for  some  public  good  if  they  all  agree <period> when  the  tsunami  hit  south  asia <comma> the  united  states  contributed  12  billion  dollars <period> 30  percent  of  our  households  gave <period> half  of  them  gave  over  the  internet <period> the  median  contribution  was  somewhere  around  57  dollars <period> and  thirdly <comma> because  of  the  rise  of  non-governmental  organizations <period> they <comma> businesses <comma> other  citizens  groups <comma> have  enormous  power  to  affect  the  lives  of  our  fellow  human  beings <period> when  i  became  president  in  1993 <comma> there  were  none  of  these  organizations  in  russia <period> there  are  now  a  couple  of  hundred  thousand <period> none  in  india <period> there  are  now  at  least  a  half  a  million  active <period> none  in  china <period> there  are  now  250,000  registered  with  the  government <comma> probably  twice  again  that  many  who  are  not  registered  for  political  reasons <period> when  i  organized  my  foundation <comma> and  i  thought  about  the  world  as  it  is  and  the  world  that  i  hope  to  leave  to  the  next  generation <comma> and  i  tried  to  be  realistic  about  what  i  had  cared  about  all  my  life  that  i  could  still  have  an  impact  on <period> i  wanted  to  focus  on  activities  that  would  help  to  alleviate  poverty <comma> fight  disease <comma> combat  climate  change <comma> bridge  the  religious <comma> racial  and  other  divides  that  torment  the  world <comma> but  to  do  it  in  a  way  that  would  either  use  whatever  particular  skills  we  could  put  together  in  our  group  to  change  the  way  some  public  good  function  was  performed  so  that  it  would  sweep  across  the  world  more <period> you  saw  one  reference  to  that  in  what  we  were  able  to  do  with  aids  drugs <period> and  i  want  to  say  that  the  head  of  our  aids  effort <comma> and  the  person  who  also  is  primarily  active  in  the  wish  i  'll  make  tonight <comma> ira  magaziner <comma> is  here  with  me  and  i  want  to  thank  him  for  everything  he  's  done <period> he  's  over  there <period> when  i  got  out  of  office  and  was  asked  to  work <comma> first  in  the  caribbean <comma> to  try  to  help  deal  with  the  aids  crisis <comma> generic  drugs  were  available  for  about  500  dollars  a  person  a  year <period> if  you  bought  them  in  vast  bulks <comma> you  could  get  them  at  a  little  under  400  dollars <period> the  first  country  we  went  to  work  in <comma> the  bahamas <comma> was  paying  3,500  dollars  for  these  drugs <period> the  market  was  so  terribly  disorganized  that  they  were  buying  this  medicine  through  two  agents  who  were  gigging  them  sevenfold <period> so  the  very  first  week  we  were  working <comma> we  got  the  price  down  to  500  dollars <period> and  all  of  a  sudden <comma> they  could  save  seven  times  as  many  lives  for  the  same  amount  of  money <period> then  we  went  to  work  with  the  manufacturers  of  aids  medicines <comma> one  of  whom  was  cited  in  the  film <comma> and  negotiated  a  whole  different  change  in  business  strategy <period> because  even  at  500  dollars <comma> these  drugs  were  being  sold  on  a  high-margin <comma> low-volume <comma> uncertain-payment  basis <period> so  we  worked  on  improving  the  productivity  of  the  operations  and  the  supply  chain <comma> and  went  to  a  low-margin <comma> high-volume <comma> absolutely  certain-payment  business <period> i  joked  that  the  main  contribution  we  made  to  the  battle  against  aids  was  to  get  the  manufacturers  to  change  from  a  jewelry  store  to  a  grocery  store  strategy <period> but  the  price  went  to  140  dollars  from  500 <period> and  pretty  soon <comma> the  average  price  was  192  dollars <period> now  we  can  get  it  for  about  100  dollars <period> children  's  medicine  was  600  dollars <comma> because  nobody  could  afford  to  buy  any  of  it <period> we  negotiated  it  down  to  190 <period> then <comma> the  french  imposed  their  brilliantly  conceived  airline  tax  to  create  a  something  called  unitaid <comma> got  a  bunch  of  other  countries  to  help <period> that  children  's  medicine  is  now  60  dollars  a  person  a  year <period> the  only  thing  that  is  keeping  us  from  basically  saving  the  lives  of  everybody  who  needs  the  medicine  to  stay  alive  are  the  absence  of  systems  necessary  to  diagnose <comma> treat  and  care  for  people  and  deliver  this  medicine <period> we  started  a  childhood  obesity  initiative  with  the  heart  association  in  america <period> we  tried  to  do  the  same  thing  by  negotiating  industry-right  deals  with  the  soft  drink  and  the  snack  food  industry  to  cut  the  caloric  and  other  dangerous  content  of  food  going  to  our  children  in  the  schools <period> we  just  reorganized  the  markets <period> and  it  occurred  to  me  that  in  this  whole  non-governmental  world <comma> somebody  needs  to  be  thinking  about  organizing  public  goods  markets <period> and  that  is  now  what  we  're  trying  to  do <comma> and  working  with  this  large  cities  group  to  fight  climate  change <comma> to  negotiate  huge <comma> big <comma> volume  deals  that  will  enable  cities  which  generate  75  percent  of  the  world  's  greenhouse  gases <comma> to  drastically  and  quickly  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  a  way  that  is  good  economics <period> and  this  whole  discussion  as  if  it  's  some  sort  of  economic  burden <comma> is  a  mystery  to  me <period> i  think  it  's  a  bird  's  nest  on  the  ground <period> when  al  gore  won  his  well-deserved  oscar  for  the  inconvenient  truth  movie <comma> i  was  thrilled <comma> but  i  had  urged  him  to  make  a  second  movie  quickly <period> for  those  of  you  who  saw  an  inconvenient  truth <comma> the  most  important  slide  in  the  gore  lecture  is  the  last  one <comma> which  shows  here  's  where  greenhouse  gases  are  going  if  we  do  n't  do  anything <comma> here  's  where  they  could  go <period> and  then  there  are  six  different  categories  of  things  we  can  do  to  change  the  trajectory <period> we  need  a  movie  on  those  six  categories <period> and  all  of  you  need  to  have  it  embedded  in  your  brains  and  to  organize  yourselves  around  it <period> so  we  're  trying  to  do  that <period> so  organizing  these  markets  is  one  thing  we  try  to  do <period> now  we  have  taken  on  a  second  thing <comma> and  this  gets  to  my  wish <period> it  has  been  my  experience  in  working  in  developing  countries  that  while  the  headlines  may  all  be <comma> the  pessimistic  headlines  may  say <comma> well <comma> we  cannot  do  this <comma> that  or  the  other  thing  because  of  corruption <comma> i  think  incapacity  is  a  far  bigger  problem  in  poor  countries  than  corruption <comma> and  feeds  corruption <period> we  now  have  the  money <comma> given  these  low  prices <comma> to  distribute  aids  drugs  all  over  the  world  to  people  we  cannot  presently  reach <period> today  these  low  prices  are  available  in  the  25  countries  where  we  work <comma> and  in  a  total  of  62  countries <period> and  about  550,000  people  are  getting  the  benefits  of  them <period> but  the  money  is  there  to  reach  others <period> the  systems  are  not  there  to  reach  the  people <period> so  what  we  have  been  trying  to  do <comma> working  first  in  rwanda  and  then  in  malawi  and  other  places <comma> but  i  want  to  talk  about  rwanda  tonight <comma> is  to  develop  a  model  for  rural  health  care  in  a  very  poor  area  that  can  be  used  to  deal  with  aids <comma> tb <comma> malaria <comma> other  infectious  diseases <comma> maternal  and  child  health <comma> and  a  whole  range  of  health  issues  poor  people  are  grappling  with  in  the  developing  world <comma> that  can  first  be  scaled  for  the  whole  nation  of  rwanda <comma> and  then  will  be  a  model  that  could  literally <period> be  implemented  in  any  other  poor  country  in  the  world <period> and  the  test  is <comma> one <comma> will  it  do  the  job <questionmark> will  it  provide  high  quality  care <questionmark> and  two <comma> will  it  do  it  at  a  price  that  will  enable  the  country  to  sustain  a  health  care  system  without  foreign  donors  after  five  to  10  years <questionmark> because  the  longer  i  deal  with  these  problems <comma> the  more  convinced  i  am  that  we  have  to <comma> whether  it  's  economics <comma> health <comma> education <comma> whatever <comma> we  have  to  build  systems <period> and  the  absence  of  systems  that  function  break  the  connection  which  got  you  all  in  this  seat  tonight <period> you  think  about  whatever  your  life  has  been <comma> however  many  obstacles  you  have  faced  in  your  life <comma> at  critical  junctures  you  always  knew  there  was  a  predictable  connection  between  the  effort  you  exerted  and  the  result  you  achieved <period> in  a  world  with  no  systems <comma> with  chaos <comma> everything  becomes  a  guerilla  struggle <comma> and  this  predictability  is  not  there <period> and  it  becomes  almost  impossible  to  save  lives <comma> educate  kids <comma> develop  economies <comma> whatever <period> the  person <comma> in  my  view <comma> who  has  done  the  best  job  of  this  in  the  health  care  area <comma> of  building  a  system  in  a  very  poor  area <comma> is  dr.  paul  farmer <comma> who <comma> many  of  you  know <comma> has  worked  for  now  20  years  with  his  group <comma> partners  in  health <comma> primarily  in  haiti  where  he  started <period> but  they've  also  worked  in  russia <comma> in  peru  and  other  places  around  the  world <period> as  poor  as  haiti  is <comma> in  the  area  where  farmer  's  clinic  is  active <comma> and  they  serve  a  catchment  area  far  greater  than  the  medical  professionals  they  have  would  indicate  they  could  serve <comma> since  1988 <comma> they  have  not  lost  one  person  to  tuberculosis <comma> not  one <period> and  they've  achieved  a  lot  of  other  amazing  health  results <period> so  when  we  decided  to  work  in  rwanda  on  trying  to  dramatically  increase  the  income  of  the  country  and  fight  the  aids  problem <comma> we  wanted  to  build  a  healthcare  network <comma> because  it  had  been  totally  destroyed  during  the  genocide  in  1994 <comma> and  the  per  capita  income  was  still  under  a  dollar  a  day <period> so  i  rang  up <comma> asked  paul  farmer  if  he  would  help <period> because  it  seemed  to  me  if  we  could  prove  there  was  a  model  in  haiti  and  a  model  in  rwanda  that  we  could  then  take  all  over  the  country <comma> number  one <comma> it  would  be  a  wonderful  thing  for  a  country  that  has  suffered  as  much  as  any  on  earth  in  the  last  15  years <comma> and  number  two <comma> we  would  have  something  that  could  then  be  adapted  to  any  other  poor  country  anywhere  in  the  world <period> and  so  we  have  set  about  doing  that <period> now <comma> we  started  working  together  18  months  ago <period> and  we  're  working  in  an  area  called  southern  kayonza <comma> which  is  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  rwanda <comma> with  a  group  that  originally  includes  about  400,000  people <period> we  're  essentially  implementing  what  paul  farmer  did  in  haiti <comma> he  develops  and  trains  paid  community  health  workers  who  are  able  to  identify  health  problems <comma> ensure  that  people  who  have  aids  or  tb  are  properly  diagnosed  and  take  their  medicine  regularly <comma> who  work  on  bringing  about  health  education <comma> clean  water  and  sanitation <comma> providing  nutritional  supplements  and  moving  people  up  the  chain  of  health  care  if  they  have  problems  of  the  severity  that  require  it <period> the  procedures  that  make  this  work  have  been  perfected <comma> as  i  said <comma> by  paul  farmer  and  his  team  in  their  work  in  rural  haiti  over  the  last  20  years <period> recently  we  did  an  evaluation  of  the  first  18  months  of  our  efforts  in  rwanda <period> and  the  results  were  so  good  that  the  rwandan  government  has  now  agreed  to  adopt  the  model  for  the  entire  country <comma> and  has  strongly  supported  and  put  the  full  resources  of  the  government  behind  it <period> i  'll  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  our  team  because  it  's  indicative  of  what  we  do <period> we  have  about  500  people  around  the  world  working  in  our  aids  program <comma> some  of  them  for  nothing <comma> just  for  transportation <comma> room  and  board <period> and  then  we  have  others  working  in  these  other  related  programs <period> our  business  plan  in  rwanda  was  put  together  under  the  leadership  of  diana  noble <comma> who  is  an  unusually  gifted  woman <comma> but  not  unusual  in  the  type  of  people  who  have  been  willing  to  do  this  kind  of  work <period> she  was  the  youngest  partner  at  schroder  ventures  in  london  in  her  20s <period> she  was  ceo  of  a  successful  e-venture <comma> she  started  and  built  reed  elsevier  ventures <comma> and  at  45  she  decided  she  wanted  to  do  something  different  with  her  life <period> so  she  now  works  full-time  on  this  for  very  little  pay <period> she  and  her  team  of  former  business  people  have  created  a  business  plan  that  will  enable  us  to  scale  this  health  system  up  for  the  whole  country <period> and  it  would  be  worthy  of  the  kind  of  private  equity  work  she  used  to  do  when  she  was  making  a  lot  more  money  for  it <period> when  we  came  to  this  rural  area <comma> 45  percent  of  the  children  under  the  age  of  five  had  stunted  growth  due  to  malnutrition <period> 23  percent  of  them  died  before  they  reached  the  age  of  five <period> mortality  at  birth  was  over  two-and-a-half  percent <period> over  15  percent  of  the  deaths  among  adults  and  children  occurred  because  of  intestinal  parasites  and  diarrhea  from  dirty  water  and  inadequate  sanitation <comma> all  entirely  preventable  and  treatable <period> over  13  percent  of  the  deaths  were  from  respiratory  illnesses <comma> again <comma> all  preventable  and  treatable <period> and  not  a  single  soul  in  this  area  was  being  treated  for  aids  or  tuberculosis <period> within  the  first  18  months <comma> the  following  things  happened <comma> we  went  from  zero  to  about  2,000  people  being  treated  for  aids <period> that  's  80  percent  of  the  people  who  need  treatment  in  this  area <period> listen  to  this <comma> less  than  four-tenths  of  one  percent  of  those  being  treated  stopped  taking  their  medicine  or  otherwise  defaulted  on  treatment <period> that  's  lower  than  the  figure  in  the  united  states <period> less  than  three-tenths  of  one  percent  had  to  transfer  to  the  more  expensive  second-line  drugs <period> 400,000  pregnant  women  were  brought  into  counseling  and  will  give  birth  for  the  first  time  within  an  organized  healthcare  system <period> that  's  about  43  percent  of  all  the  pregnancies <period> about  40  percent  of  all  the  people <comma> i  said  400,000 <period> i  meant  40,000 <period> about  40  percent  of  all  the  people  who  need  tb  treatment  are  now  getting  it <comma> in  just  18  months <comma> up  from  zero  when  we  started <period> 43  percent  of  the  children  in  need  of  an  infant  feeding  program  to  prevent  malnutrition  and  early  death  are  now  getting  the  food  supplements  they  need  to  stay  alive  and  to  grow <period> we've  started  the  first  malaria  treatment  programs  they've  ever  had  there <period> patients  admitted  to  a  hospital  that  was  destroyed  during  the  genocide  that  we  have  renovated  along  with  four  other  clinics <comma> complete  with  solar  power  generators <comma> good  lab  technology <period> we  now  are  treating  325  people  a  month <comma> despite  the  fact  that  almost  100  percent  of  the  aids  patients  are  now  treated  at  home <period> and  the  most  important  thing  is  because  we've  implemented  paul  farmer  's  model <comma> using  community  health  workers <comma> we  estimate  that  this  system  could  be  put  into  place  for  all  of  rwanda  for  between  five  and  six  percent  of  gdp <comma> and  that  the  government  could  sustain  that  without  depending  on  foreign  aid  after  five  or  six  years <period> and  for  those  of  you  who  understand  healthcare  economics  you  know  that  all  wealthy  countries  spend  between  nine  and  11  percent  of  gdp  on  health  care <comma> except  for  the  united  states <comma> we  spend  16 <comma> but  that  's  a  story  for  another  day <period> we  're  now  working  with  partners  in  health  and  the  ministry  of  health  in  rwanda  and  our  foundation  folks  to  scale  this  system  up <period> we  're  also  beginning  to  do  this  in  malawi  and  lesotho <period> and  we  have  similar  projects  in  tanzania <comma> mozambique <comma> kenya  and  ethiopia  with  other  partners  trying  to  achieve  the  same  thing <comma> to  save  as  many  lives  as  quickly  as  we  can <comma> but  to  do  it  in  a  systematic  way  that  can  be  implemented  nationwide  and  then  with  a  model  that  can  be  implemented  in  any  country  in  the  world <period> we  need  initial  upfront  investment  to  train  doctors <comma> nurses <comma> health  administration  and  community  health  workers  throughout  the  country <comma> to  set  up  the  information  technology <comma> the  solar  energy <comma> the  water  and  sanitation <comma> the  transportation  infrastructure <period> but  over  a  five-  to  10-year  period <comma> we  will  take  down  the  need  for  outside  assistance  and  eventually  it  will  be  phased  out <period> my  wish  is  that  ted  assist  us  in  our  work  and  help  us  to  build  a  high-quality  rural  health  system  in  a  poor  country <comma> rwanda <comma> that  can  be  a  model  for  africa <comma> and  indeed <comma> for  any  poor  country  anywhere  in  the  world <period> my  belief  is  that  this  will  help  us  to  build  a  more  integrated  world  with  more  partners  and  fewer  terrorists <comma> with  more  productive  citizens  and  fewer  haters <comma> a  place  we'd  all  want  our  kids  and  our  grandchildren  to  grow  up  in <period> it  has  been  an  honor  for  me <comma> particularly <comma> to  work  in  rwanda  where  we  also  have  a  major  economic  development  project  in  partnership  with  sir  tom  hunter <comma> the  scottish  philanthropist <comma> where  last  year  we <comma> using  the  same  thing  with  aids  drugs <comma> cut  the  cost  of  fertilizer  and  the  interest  rates  on  microcredit  loans  by  30  percent  and  achieved  three-  to  four-hundred  percent  increases  in  crop  yields  with  the  farmers <period> these  people  have  been  through  a  lot  and  none  of  us <comma> most  of  all  me <comma> helped  them  when  they  were  on  the  verge  of  destroying  each  other <period> we  're  undoing  that  now <comma> and  they  are  so  over  it  and  so  into  their  future <period> we  're  doing  this  in  an  environmentally  responsible  way <period> i  'm  doing  my  best  to  convince  them  not  to  run  the  electric  grid  to  the  35  percent  of  the  people  that  have  no  access <comma> but  to  do  it  with  clean  energy <period> to  have  responsible  reforestation  projects <period> the  rwandans <comma> interestingly  enough <comma> have  been  quite  good <comma> mr.  wilson <comma> in  preserving  their  topsoil <period> there  's  a  couple  of  guys  from  southern  farming  families <comma> the  first  thing  i  did  when  i  went  out  to  this  place  was  to  get  down  on  my  hands  and  knees  and  dig  in  the  dirt  and  see  what  they'd  done  with  it <period> we  have  a  chance  here  to  prove  that  a  country  that  almost  slaughtered  itself  out  of  existence  can  practice  reconciliation <comma> reorganize  itself <comma> focus  on  tomorrow  and  provide  comprehensive <comma> quality  health  care  with  minimal  outside  help <period> i  am  grateful  for  this  prize <comma> and  i  will  use  it  to  that  end <period> we  could  use  some  more  help  to  do  this <comma> but  think  of  what  it  would  mean  if  we  could  have  a  world-class  health  system  in  rwanda <comma> in  a  country  with  a  less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita  income <comma> one  that  could  save  hundreds  of  millions  of  lives  over  the  next  decade  if  applied  to  every  similarly  situated  country  on  earth <period> it  's  worth  a  try  and  i  believe  it  would  succeed <period> thank  you  and  god  bless  you <period> so <comma> i  kind  of  believe  that  we  're  in  like  the  cave-painting  era  of  computer  interfaces <period> like <comma> they  're  very  kind  of <comma> they  do  n't  go  as  deep  or  as  emotionally  engaging  as  they  possibly  could  be  and  i'd  like  to  change  all  that <period> hit  me <period> ok <period> so  i  mean <comma> this  is  the  kind  of  status  quo  interface <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  very  flat <comma> kind  of  rigid <period> and  ok <comma> so  you  could  sex  it  up  and  like  go  to  a  much  more  lickable  mac <comma> you  know <comma> but  really  it  's  the  kind  of  same  old  crap  we've  had  for  the  last <comma> you  know <comma> 30  years <period> like  i  think  we  really  put  up  with  a  lot  of  crap  with  our  computers <period> i  mean  it  's  point  and  click <comma> it  's  like  the  menus <comma> icons <comma> it  's  all  the  kind  of  same  thing <period> and  so  one  kind  of  information  space  that  i  take  inspiration  from  is  my  real  desk <period> it  's  so  much  more  subtle <comma> so  much  more  visceral <comma> you  know <comma> what  's  visible <comma> what  's  not <period> and  i'd  like  to  bring  that  experience  to  the  desktop <period> so  i  kind  of  have  a <comma> this  is  bumptop <period> it  's  kind  of  like  a  new  approach  to  desktop  computing <period> so  you  can  bump  things <comma> they  're  all  physically <comma> you  know <comma> manipulable  and  stuff <period> and  instead  of  that  point  and  click <comma> it  's  like  a  push  and  pull <comma> things  collide  as  you'd  expect  them <period> just  like  on  my  real  desk <comma> i  can <comma> let  me  just  grab  these  guys <comma> i  can  turn  things  into  piles  instead  of  just  the  folders  that  we  have <period> and  once  things  are  in  a  pile  i  can  browse  them  by  throwing  them  into  a  grid <period> or  you  know <comma> flip  through  them  like  a  book  or  i  can  lay  them  out  like  a  deck  of  cards <period> when  they  're  laid  out <comma> i  can  pull  things  to  new  locations  or  delete  things  or  just  quickly  sort  a  whole  pile <comma> you  know <comma> just  immediately <comma> right <questionmark> and  then <comma> it  's  all  smoothly  animated <comma> instead  of  these  jarring  changes  you  see  in  today  's  interfaces <period> also <comma> if  i  want  to  add  something  to  a  pile <comma> well <comma> how  do  i  do  that <questionmark> i  just  toss  it  to  the  pile <comma> and  it  's  added  right  to  the  top <period> it  's  a  kind  of  nice  way <period> also  some  of  the  stuff  we  can  do  is <comma> for  these  individual  icons  we  thought <comma> i  mean <comma> how  can  we  play  with  the  idea  of  an  icon <comma> and  push  that  further <questionmark> and  one  of  the  things  i  can  do  is  make  it  bigger  if  i  want  to  emphasize  it  and  make  it  more  important <period> but  what  's  really  cool  is  that  since  there  's  a  physics  simulation  running  under  this <comma> it  's  actually  heavier <period> so  the  lighter  stuff  does  n't  really  move  but  if  i  throw  it  at  the  lighter  guys <comma> right <questionmark> so  it  's  cute <comma> but  it  's  also  like  a  subtle  channel  of  conveying  information <comma> right <questionmark> this  is  heavy  so  it  feels  more  important <period> so  it  's  kind  of  cool <period> despite  computers  everywhere  paper  really  has  n't  disappeared <comma> because  it  has  a  lot  of <comma> i  think <comma> valuable  properties <period> and  some  of  those  we  wanted  to  transfer  to  the  icons  in  our  system <period> so  one  of  the  things  you  can  do  to  our  icons <comma> just  like  paper <comma> is  crease  them  and  fold  them <period> just  like  paper <period> remember <comma> you  know <comma> something  for  later <period> or  if  you  want  to  be  destructive <comma> you  can  just  crumple  it  up  and <comma> you  know <comma> toss  it  to  the  corner <period> also  just  like  paper <comma> around  our  workspace  we  'll  pin  things  up  to  the  wall  to  remember  them  later <comma> and  i  can  do  the  same  thing  here <comma> and  you  know <comma> you  'll  see  post-it  notes  and  things  like  that  around  people  's  offices <period> and  i  can  pull  them  off  when  i  want  to  work  with  them <period> so <comma> one  of  the  criticisms  of  this  kind  of  approach  to  organization  is  that <comma> you  know <comma> okay <comma> well  my  real  desk  is  really  messy <period> i  do  n't  want  that  mess  on  my  computer  so  one  thing  we  have  for  that  is  like  a  grid  align <comma> kind  of <comma> so  you  get  that  more  traditional  desktop <period> things  are  kind  of  grid  aligned <period> more  boring <comma> but  you  still  have  that  kind  of  colliding  and  bumping <period> and  you  can  still  do  fun  things  like  make  shelves  on  your  desktop <period> let  's  just  break  this  shelf <period> okay <comma> that  shelf  broke <period> i  think  beyond  the  icons <comma> i  think  another  really  cool  domain  for  this  software <comma> i  think  it  applies  to  more  than  just  icons  and  your  desktop <comma> but  browsing  photographs <period> i  think  you  can  really  enrich  the  way  we  browse  our  photographs <period> and  bring  it  to  that  kind  of  shoebox  of <comma> you  know <comma> photos  with  your  family  on  the  kitchen  table  kind  of  thing <period> i  can  toss  these  things  around <period> they  're  so  much  more  tangible  and  touchable <comma> and  you  know  i  can  double-click  on  something  to  take  a  look  at  it <period> and  i  can  do  all  that  kind  of  same  stuff  i  showed  you  before <period> so  i  can  pile  things  up <comma> i  can  flip  through  it <comma> i  can <comma> you  know <comma> okay <comma> let  's  move  this  photo  to  the  back <comma> let  's  delete  this  guy  here <comma> and  i  think  it  's  just  a  much  more  rich  kind  of  way  of  interacting  with  your  information <period> and  that  's  bumptop <period> thanks <period> i  do  n't  understand  myself <comma> why  they  keep  talking  of  love <comma> if  they  come  near  me <comma> if  they  look  into  my  eyes  and  kiss  my  hand <period> i  do  n't  understand  myself <comma> why  they  talk  of  magic <comma> that  no  one  withstands <comma> if  he  sees  me <comma> if  he  passes  by <period> but  if  the  red  light  is  on  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and  everybody  listens  to  my  song <comma> then  it  is  plain  to  see <period> my  lips <comma> they  give  so  fiery  a  kiss <comma> my  limbs <comma> they  are  supple  and  white <period> it  is  written  for  me  in  the  stars <comma> thou  shalt  kiss <comma> thou  shalt  love <period> my  feet <comma> they  glide  and  float <comma> my  eyes <comma> they  lure  and  glow <period> and  i  dance  as  if  entranced <comma> cause  i  know <comma> my  lips  give  so  fiery  a  kiss <period> in  my  veins <comma> runs  a  dancer  's  blood <comma> because  my  beautiful  mother  was  the  queen  of  dance  in  the  gilded  alcazar <period> she  was  so  very  beautiful <comma> i  often  saw  her  in  my  dreams <period> if  she  beat  the  tambourine  to  her  beguiling  dance <comma> all  eyes  were  glowing  admiringly <period> she  reawakened  in  me <comma> mine  is  the  same  lot <period> i  dance  like  her  at  midnight  and  from  deep  within  i  feel <comma> my  lips <comma> they  give  so  fiery  a  kiss <comma> my  limbs <comma> they  are  supple  and  white <period> it  is  written  for  me  in  the  stars <comma> thou  shalt  kiss <comma> thou  shalt  love <period> and  i  dance  as  if  entranced <comma> cause  i  know <comma> my  lips  give  so  fiery  a  kiss <period> /transcript <period> i  'm  not  quite  sure  whether  i  really  want  to  see  a  snare  drum  at  nine  o'clock  or  so  in  the  morning <period> but  anyway <comma> it  's  just  great  to  see  such  a  full  theater <comma> and  really  i  must  thank  herbie  hancock  and  his  colleagues  for  such  a  great  presentation <period> one  of  the  interesting  things <comma> of  course <comma> is  the  combination  of  that  raw  hand  on  the  instrument  and  technology <comma> and  of  course  what  he  said  about  listening  to  our  young  people <period> of  course <comma> my  job  is  all  about  listening <comma> and  my  aim <comma> really <comma> is  to  teach  the  world  to  listen <period> that  's  my  only  real  aim  in  life <period> and  it  sounds  quite  simple <comma> but  actually  it  's  quite  a  big <comma> big  job <period> because  you  know <comma> when  you  look  at  a  piece  of  music <comma> for  example <comma> if  i  just  open  my  little  motorbike  bag <comma> we  have  here <comma> hopefully <comma> a  piece  of  music  that  is  full  of  little  black  dots  on  the  page <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> we  open  it  up  and  i  read  the  music <period> so  technically <comma> i  can  actually  read  this <period> i  will  follow  the  instructions <comma> the  tempo  markings <comma> the  dynamics <period> i  will  do  exactly  as  i  'm  told <period> and  so  therefore <comma> because  time  is  short <comma> if  i  just  play  you  literally  the  first  maybe  two  lines  or  so <period> it  's  very  straightforward <period> there  's  nothing  too  difficult  about  the  piece <period> but  here  i  'm  being  told  that  the  piece  of  music  is  very  quick <period> i  'm  being  told  where  to  play  on  the  drum <period> i  'm  being  told  which  part  of  the  stick  to  use <period> and  i  'm  being  told  the  dynamic <period> and  i  'm  also  being  told  that  the  drum  is  without  snares <period> snares  on <comma> snares  off <period> so  therefore <comma> if  i  translate  this  piece  of  music <comma> we  have  this  idea <period> and  so  on <period> my  career  would  probably  last  about  five  years <period> however <comma> what  i  have  to  do  as  a  musician  is  do  everything  that  is  not  on  the  music <period> everything  that  there  is  n't  time  to  learn  from  a  teacher <comma> or  to  talk  about <comma> even <comma> from  a  teacher <period> but  it  's  the  things  that  you  notice  when  you  're  not  actually  with  your  instrument  that  in  fact  become  so  interesting <comma> and  that  you  want  to  explore  through  this  tiny <comma> tiny  surface  of  a  drum <period> so  there <comma> we  experience  the  translation <period> now  we  'll  experience  the  interpretation <period> now  my  career  may  last  a  little  longer <period> but  in  a  way <comma> you  know <comma> it  's  the  same  if  i  look  at  you  and  i  see  a  nice  bright  young  lady  with  a  pink  top  on <period> i  see  that  you  're  clutching  a  teddy  bear <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> so  i  get  a  basic  idea  as  to  what  you  might  be  about <comma> what  you  might  like <comma> what  you  might  do  as  a  profession <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> however <comma> that  's  just <comma> you  know <comma> the  initial  idea  i  may  have  that  we  all  get  when  we  actually  look <comma> and  we  try  to  interpret <comma> but  actually  it  's  so  unbelievably  shallow <period> in  the  same  way <comma> i  look  at  the  music <period> i  get  a  basic  idea <period> i  wonder  what  technically  might  be  hard <comma> or <comma> you  know <comma> what  i  want  to  do <period> just  the  basic  feeling <period> however <comma> that  is  simply  not  enough <period> and  i  think  what  herbie  said <comma> please  listen <comma> listen <period> we  have  to  listen  to  ourselves <comma> first  of  all <period> if  i  play <comma> for  example <comma> holding  the  stick <comma> where  literally  i  do  not  let  go  of  the  stick <comma> you  'll  experience  quite  a  lot  of  shock  coming  up  through  the  arm <period> and  you  feel  really  quite <comma> believe  it  or  not <comma> detached  from  the  instrument  and  from  the  stick <comma> even  though  i  'm  actually  holding  the  stick  quite  tightly <period> by  holding  it  tightly <comma> i  feel  strangely  more  detached <period> if  i  just  simply  let  go  and  allow  my  hand <comma> my  arm <comma> to  be  more  of  a  support  system <comma> suddenly  i  have  more  dynamic  with  less  effort <period> much  more <period> and  i  just  feel <comma> at  last <comma> one  with  the  stick  and  one  with  the  drum <period> and  i  'm  doing  far <comma> far  less <period> so  in  the  same  way  that  i  need  time  with  this  instrument <comma> i  need  time  with  people  in  order  to  interpret  them <period> not  just  translate  them <comma> but  interpret  them <period> if <comma> for  example <comma> i  play  just  a  few  bars  of  a  piece  of  music  for  which  i  think  of  myself  as  a  technician <comma> that  is <comma> someone  who  is  basically  a  percussion  player <period> and  so  on <period> if  i  think  of  myself  as  a  musician <period> and  so  on <period> there  is  a  little  bit  of  a  difference  there  that  is  worth  just <comma> thinking  about <period> and  i  remember  when  i  was  12  years  old <comma> and  i  started  playing  tympani  and  percussion <comma> and  my  teacher  said <comma> well <comma> how  are  we  going  to  do  this <questionmark> you  know <comma> music  is  about  listening <period> and  i  said <comma> yes <comma> i  agree  with  that <period> so  what  's  the  problem <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> well <comma> how  are  you  going  to  hear  this <questionmark> how  are  you  going  to  hear  that <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> well <comma> how  do  you  hear  it <questionmark> he  said <comma> well <comma> i  think  i  hear  it  through  here <period> and  i  said <comma> well <comma> i  think  i  do  too <comma> but  i  also  hear  it  through  my  hands <comma> through  my  arms <comma> cheekbones <comma> my  scalp <comma> my  tummy <comma> my  chest <comma> my  legs  and  so  on <period> and  so  we  began  our  lessons  every  single  time  tuning  drums <comma> in  particular <comma> the  kettle  drums <comma> or  tympani <comma> to  such  a  narrow  pitch  interval <comma> so  something  like <period> that  of  a  difference <period> then  gradually <period> and  gradually <period> and  it  's  amazing  that  when  you  do  open  your  body  up <comma> and  open  your  hand  up  to  allow  the  vibration  to  come  through <comma> that  in  fact  the  tiny <comma> tiny  difference <period> can  be  felt  with  just  the  tiniest  part  of  your  finger <comma> there <period> and  so  what  we  would  do  is  that  i  would  put  my  hands  on  the  wall  of  the  music  room <comma> and  together  we  would  listen  to  the  sounds  of  the  instruments <comma> and  really  try  to  connect  with  those  sounds  far <comma> far  more  broadly  than  simply  depending  on  the  ear <period> because  of  course <comma> the  ear  is <comma> i  mean <comma> subject  to  all  sorts  of  things <period> the  room  we  happen  to  be  in <comma> the  amplification <comma> the  quality  of  the  instrument <comma> the  type  of  sticks <period> etc <comma> etc <period> they  're  all  different <period> same  amount  of  weight <comma> but  different  sound  colors <period> and  that  's  basically  what  we  are <period> we  're  just  human  beings <comma> but  we  all  have  our  own  little  sound  colors <comma> as  it  were <comma> that  make  up  these  extraordinary  personalities  and  characters  and  interests  and  things <period> and  as  i  grew  older <comma> i  then  auditioned  for  the  royal  academy  of  music  in  london <comma> and  they  said <comma> well <comma> no <comma> we  wo  n't  accept  you <comma> because  we  have  n't  a  clue <comma> you  know <comma> of  the  future  of  a  so-called  deaf  musician <period> and  i  just  could  n't  quite  accept  that <period> and  so  therefore <comma> i  said  to  them <comma> well <comma> look <comma> if  you  refuse <comma> if  you  refuse  me  through  those  reasons <comma> as  opposed  to  the  ability  to  perform  and  to  understand  and  love  the  art  of  creating  sound <comma> then  we  have  to  think  very <comma> very  hard  about  the  people  you  do  actually  accept <period> and  as  a  result <comma> once  we  got  over  a  little  hurdle <comma> and  having  to  audition  twice <comma> they  accepted  me <period> and  not  only  that <comma> what  had  happened  was  that  it  changed  the  whole  role  of  the  music  institutions  throughout  the  united  kingdom <period> under  no  circumstances  were  they  to  refuse  any  application  whatsoever  on  the  basis  of  whether  someone  had  no  arms <comma> no  legs <comma> they  could  still  perhaps  play  a  wind  instrument  if  it  was  supported  on  a  stand <period> no  circumstances  at  all  were  used  to  refuse  any  entry <period> and  every  single  entry  had  to  be  listened  to <comma> experienced  and  then  based  on  the  musical  ability <comma> then  that  person  could  either  enter  or  not <period> so  therefore <comma> this  in  turn  meant  that  there  was  an  extremely  interesting  bunch  of  students  who  arrived  in  these  various  music  institutions <period> and  i  have  to  say <comma> many  of  them  now  in  the  professional  orchestras  throughout  the  world <period> the  interesting  thing  about  this  as  well <comma> though <comma> is  quite  simply  that  not  only  were  people  connected  with  sound <comma> which  is  basically  all  of  us <comma> and  we  well  know  that  music  really  is  our  daily  medicine <period> i  say  music <comma> but  actually  i  mean  sound <period> because  you  know <comma> some  of  the  extraordinary  things  i've  experienced  as  a  musician <comma> when  you  may  have  a  15-year-old  lad  who  has  got  the  most  incredible  challenges <comma> who  may  not  be  able  to  control  his  movements <comma> who  may  be  deaf <comma> who  may  be  blind <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> -- <period> suddenly <comma> if  that  young  lad  sits  close  to  this  instrument <comma> and  perhaps  even  lies  underneath  the  marimba <comma> and  you  play  something  that  's  so  incredibly  organ-like <comma> almost <comma> i  do  n't  really  have  the  right  sticks <comma> perhaps <comma> but  something  like  this <period> let  me  change <period> something  that  's  so  unbelievably  simple <comma> but  he  would  be  experiencing  something  that  i  would  n't  be <comma> because  i  'm  on  top  of  the  sound <period> i  have  the  sound  coming  this  way <period> he  would  have  the  sound  coming  through  the  resonators <period> if  there  were  no  resonators  on  here <comma> we  would  have <period> so  he  would  have  a  fullness  of  sound  that  those  of  you  in  the  front  few  rows  would  n't  experience <comma> those  of  you  in  the  back  few  rows  would  n't  experience  either <period> every  single  one  of  us <comma> depending  on  where  we  're  sitting <comma> will  experience  this  sound  quite <comma> quite  differently <period> and  of  course <comma> being  the  participator  of  the  sound <comma> and  that  is  starting  from  the  idea  of  what  type  of  sound  i  want  to  produce <comma> for  example <comma> this  sound <period> can  you  hear  anything <questionmark> exactly <period> because  i  'm  not  even  touching  it <period> but  yet <comma> we  get  the  sensation  of  something  happening <period> in  the  same  way  that  when  i  see  tree  moves <comma> then  i  imagine  that  tree  making  a  rustling  sound <period> do  you  see  what  i  mean <questionmark> whatever  the  eye  sees <comma> then  there  's  always  sound  happening <period> so  there  's  always <comma> always  that  huge <comma> i  mean <comma> just  this  kaleidoscope  of  things  to  draw  from <period> so  all  of  my  performances  are  based  on  entirely  what  i  experience <comma> and  not  by  learning  a  piece  of  music <comma> putting  on  someone  else  's  interpretation  of  it <comma> buying  all  the  cds  possible  of  that  particular  piece  of  music <comma> and  so  on  and  so  forth <period> because  that  is  n't  giving  me  enough  of  something  that  is  so  raw  and  so  basic <comma> and  something  that  i  can  fully  experience  the  journey  of <period> so  it  may  be  that <comma> in  certain  halls <comma> this  dynamic  may  well  work <period> it  may  be  that  in  other  halls <comma> they  're  simply  not  going  to  experience  that  at  all  and  so  therefore <comma> my  level  of  soft <comma> gentle  playing  may  have  to  be <period> do  you  see  what  i  mean <questionmark> so <comma> because  of  this  explosion  in  access  to  sound <comma> especially  through  the  deaf  community <comma> this  has  not  only  affected  how  music  institutions <comma> how  schools  for  the  deaf  treat  sound <comma> and  not  just  as  a  means  of  therapy <comma> although  of  course <comma> being  a  participator  of  music <comma> that  definitely  is  the  case  as  well <period> but  it  's  meant  that  acousticians  have  had  to  really  think  about  the  types  of  halls  they  put  together <period> there  are  so  few  halls  in  this  world  that  actually  have  very  good  acoustics <comma> dare  i  say <period> but  by  that  i  mean  where  you  can  absolutely  do  anything  you  imagine <period> the  tiniest <comma> softest <comma> softest  sound  to  something  that  is  so  broad <comma> so  huge <comma> so  incredible <period> there  's  always  something <comma> it  may  sound  good  up  there <comma> may  not  be  so  good  there <period> may  be  great  there <comma> but  terrible  up  there <period> maybe  terrible  over  there <comma> but  not  too  bad  there <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> so  to  find  an  actual  hall  is  incredible <comma> for  which  you  can  play  exactly  what  you  imagine <comma> without  it  being  cosmetically  enhanced <period> and  so  therefore <comma> acousticians  are  actually  in  conversation  with  people  who  are  hearing  impaired <comma> and  who  are  participators  of  sound <period> and  this  is  quite  interesting <period> i  cannot <comma> you  know <comma> give  you  any  detail  as  far  as  what  is  actually  happening  with  those  halls <comma> but  it  's  just  the  fact  that  they  are  going  to  a  group  of  people  for  whom  so  many  years  we've  been  saying <comma> well <comma> how  on  earth  can  they  experience  music <questionmark> you  know <comma> they  're  deaf <period> we  just <comma> we  go  like  that <comma> and  we  imagine  that  that  's  what  deafness  is  about <period> or  we  go  like  that <comma> and  we  imagine  that  's  what  blindness  is  about <period> if  we  see  someone  in  a  wheelchair <comma> we  assume  they  cannot  walk <period> it  may  be  that  they  can  walk  three <comma> four <comma> five  steps <period> that <comma> to  them <comma> means  they  can  walk <period> in  a  year  's  time <comma> it  could  be  two  extra  steps <period> in  another  year  's  time <comma> three  extra  steps <period> those  are  hugely  important  aspects  to  think  about <period> so  when  we  do  listen  to  each  other <comma> it  's  unbelievably  important  for  us  to  really  test  our  listening  skills <period> to  really  use  our  bodies  as  a  resonating  chamber <comma> to  stop  the  judgment <period> for  me <comma> as  a  musician  who  deals  with  99  percent  of  new  music <comma> it  's  very  easy  for  me  to  say <comma> oh  yes <comma> i  like  that  piece <period> oh  no <comma> i  do  n't  like  that  piece  and  so  on <period> and  you  know <comma> i  just  find  that  i  have  to  give  those  pieces  of  music  real  time <period> it  may  be  that  the  chemistry  is  n't  quite  right  between  myself  and  that  particular  piece  of  music <period> but  that  does  n't  mean  i  have  the  right  to  say  it  's  a  bad  piece  of  music <period> and  you  know <comma> it  's  just  one  of  the  great  things  about  being  a  musician <comma> is  that  it  is  so  unbelievably  fluid <period> so  there  are  no  rules <comma> no  right <comma> no  wrong <comma> this  way <comma> that  way <period> if  i  asked  you  to  clap <comma> maybe  i  can  do  this <period> if  i  can  just  say <comma> please  clap  and  create  the  sound  of  thunder <period> i  'm  assuming  we've  all  experienced  thunder <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  mean  just  the  sound <period> i  mean  really  listen  to  that  thunder  within  yourselves <period> and  please  try  to  create  that  through  your  clapping <period> try <period> just <comma> please  try <period> very  good <period> snow <period> snow <period> have  you  ever  heard  snow <questionmark> audience <comma> no <period> evelyn  glennie <comma> well  then <comma> stop  clapping <period> try  again <period> try  again <period> snow <period> see <comma> you  're  awake <period> rain <period> not  bad <period> not  bad <period> you  know <comma> the  interesting  thing  here <comma> though <comma> is  that  i  asked  a  group  of  kids  not  so  long  ago  exactly  the  same  question <period> now <comma> great  imagination <comma> thank  you  very  much <period> however <comma> not  one  of  you  got  out  of  your  seats  to  think <comma> right <period> how  can  i  clap <questionmark> ok <comma> maybe <period> maybe  i  can  use  my  jewelry  to  create  extra  sounds <period> maybe  i  can  use  the  other  parts  of  my  body  to  create  extra  sounds <period> not  a  single  one  of  you  thought  about  clapping  in  a  slightly  different  way  other  than  sitting  in  your  seats  there  and  using  two  hands <period> in  the  same  way  that  when  we  listen  to  music <comma> we  assume  that  it  's  all  being  fed  through  here <period> this  is  how  we  experience  music <period> of  course  it  's  not <period> we  experience  thunder <comma> thunder <comma> thunder <period> think <comma> think <comma> think <period> listen <comma> listen <comma> listen <period> now <comma> what  can  we  do  with  thunder <questionmark> i  remember  my  teacher <period> when  i  first  started <comma> my  very  first  lesson <comma> i  was  all  prepared  with  sticks <comma> ready  to  go <period> and  instead  of  him  saying <comma> ok <comma> evelyn <comma> please <comma> feet  slightly  apart <comma> arms  at  a  more-or-less  90  degree  angle <comma> sticks  in  a  more-or-less  v  shape <comma> keep  this  amount  of  space  here <comma> etc <period> please  keep  your  back  straight <comma> etc <comma> etc <comma> etc  -- <period> where  i  was  probably  just  going  to  end  up  absolutely  rigid <comma> frozen <comma> and  i  would  not  be  able  to  strike  the  drum <comma> because  i  was  thinking  of  so  many  other  things <comma> he  said <comma> evelyn <comma> take  this  drum  away  for  seven  days <comma> and  i  'll  see  you  next  week <period> so <comma> heavens <period> what  was  i  to  do <questionmark> i  no  longer  required  the  sticks <period> i  was  n't  allowed  to  have  these  sticks <period> i  had  to  basically  look  at  this  particular  drum <comma> see  how  it  was  made <comma> what  these  little  lugs  did <comma> what  the  snares  did <period> turned  it  upside  down <comma> experimented  with  the  shell <comma> experimented  with  the  head <period> experimented  with  my  body <comma> experimented  with  jewelry <comma> experimented  with  all  sorts  of  things <period> and  of  course <comma> i  returned  with  all  sorts  of  bruises  and  things  like  that <comma> but  nevertheless <comma> it  was  such  an  unbelievable  experience <comma> because  then <comma> where  on  earth  are  you  going  to  experience  that  in  a  piece  of  music <questionmark> where  on  earth  are  you  going  to  experience  that  in  a  study  book <questionmark> so  we  never <comma> ever  dealt  with  actual  study  books <period> so  for  example <comma> one  of  the  things  that  we  learn  when  we  are  dealing  with  being  a  percussion  player <comma> as  opposed  to  a  musician <comma> is  basically  straightforward  single  stroke  rolls <period> like  that <period> and  then  we  get  a  little  faster  and  a  little  faster  and  a  little  faster <period> and  so  on  and  so  forth <period> what  does  this  piece  require <questionmark> single  stroke  rolls <period> so  why  cannot  i  then  do  that  whilst  learning  a  piece  of  music <questionmark> and  that  's  exactly  what  he  did <period> and  interestingly <comma> the  older  i  became <comma> and  when  i  became  a  full-time  student  at  a  so  called  music  institution <comma> all  of  that  went  out  of  the  window <period> we  had  to  study  from  study  books <period> and  constantly <comma> the  question <comma> well <comma> why <questionmark> why <questionmark> what  is  this  relating  to <questionmark> i  need  to  play  a  piece  of  music  oh <comma> well <comma> this  will  help  your  control <period> well <comma> how <questionmark> why  do  i  need  to  learn  that <questionmark> i  need  to  relate  it  to  a  piece  of  music <period> you  know <period> i  need  to  say  something <period> why  am  i  practicing  paradiddles <questionmark> is  it  just  literally  for  control <comma> for  hand-stick  control <questionmark> why  am  i  doing  that <questionmark> i  need  to  have  the  reason <comma> and  the  reason  has  to  be  by  saying  something  through  the  music <period> and  by  saying  something  through  music <comma> which  basically  is  sound <comma> we  then  can  reach  all  sorts  of  things  to  all  sorts  of  people <period> but  i  do  n't  want  to  take  responsibility  of  your  emotional  baggage <period> that  's  up  to  you <comma> when  you  walk  through  a  hall <period> because  that  then  determines  what  and  how  we  listen  to  certain  things <period> i  may  feel  sorrowful <comma> or  happy <comma> or  exhilarated <comma> or  angry  when  i  play  certain  pieces  of  music <comma> but  i  'm  not  necessarily  wanting  you  to  feel  exactly  the  same  thing <period> so  please <comma> the  next  time  you  go  to  a  concert <comma> just  allow  your  body  to  open  up <comma> allow  your  body  to  be  this  resonating  chamber <period> be  aware  that  you  're  not  going  to  experience  the  same  thing  as  the  performer  is <period> the  performer  is  in  the  worst  possible  position  for  the  actual  sound <comma> because  they  're  hearing  the  contact  of  the  stick  on  the  drum <comma> or  the  mallet  on  the  bit  of  wood <comma> or  the  bow  on  the  string <comma> etc <period> or  the  breath  that  's  creating  the  sound  from  wind  and  brass <period> they  're  experiencing  that  rawness  there <period> but  yet  they  're  experiencing  something  so  unbelievably  pure <comma> which  is  before  the  sound  is  actually  happening <period> please  take  note  of  the  life  of  the  sound  after  the  actual  initial  strike <comma> or  breath <comma> is  being  pulled <period> just  experience  the  whole  journey  of  that  sound  in  the  same  way  that  i  wished  i'd  experienced  the  whole  journey  of  this  particular  conference <comma> rather  than  just  arriving  last  night <period> but  i  hope  maybe  we  can  share  one  or  two  things  as  the  day  progresses <period> but  thank  you  very  much  for  having  me <period> so  magic  is  a  very  introverted  field <period> while  scientists  regularly  publish  their  latest  research <comma> we  magicians  do  not  like  to  share  our  methods  and  secrets <period> that  's  true  even  amongst  peers <period> but  if  you  look  at  creative  practice  as  a  form  of  research <comma> or  art  as  a  form  of  r&ampd  for  humanity <comma> then  how  could  a  cyber  illusionist  like  myself  share  his  research <questionmark> now  my  own  speciality  is  combining  digital  technology  and  magic <period> and  about  three  years  ago <comma> i  started  an  exercise  in  openness  and  inclusiveness  by  reaching  out  into  the  open-source  software  community  to  create  new  digital  tools  for  magic <comma> tools  that  could  eventually  be  shared  with  other  artists  to  start  them  off  further  on  in  the  process  and  to  get  them  to  the  poetry  faster <period> today <comma> i'd  like  to  show  you  something  which  came  out  of  these  collaborations <period> it  's  an  augmented  reality  projection  tracking  and  mapping  system <comma> or  a  digital  storytelling  tool <period> could  we  bring  down  the  lights  please <questionmark> thank  you <period> and  i  'm  going  to  use  it  to  give  you  my  take  on  the  stuff  of  life <period> terribly  sorry <period> i  forgot  the  floor <period> wake  up <period> hey <period> come  on <period> please <period> come  on <period> ah <comma> sorry  about  that <period> forgot  this <period> give  it  another  try <period> okay <period> he  figured  out  the  system <period> uh  oh <period> all  right <period> let  's  try  this <period> come  on <period> hey <period> you  heard  her <comma> go  ahead <period> bye-bye <period> ten  years  ago  exactly <comma> i  was  in  afghanistan <period> i  was  covering  the  war  in  afghanistan <comma> and  i  witnessed <comma> as  a  reporter  for  al  jazeera <comma> the  amount  of  suffering  and  destruction  that  emerged  out  of  a  war  like  that <period> then <comma> two  years  later <comma> i  covered  another  war <comma> the  war  in  iraq <period> i  was  placed  at  the  center  of  that  war  because  i  was  covering  the  war  from  the  northern  part  of  iraq <period> and  the  war  ended  with  a  regime  change <comma> like  the  one  in  afghanistan <period> and  that  regime  that  we  got  rid  of  was  actually  a  dictatorship <comma> an  authoritarian  regime <comma> that  for  decades  created  a  great  sense  of  paralysis  within  the  nation <comma> within  the  people  themselves <period> however <comma> the  change  that  came  through  foreign  intervention  created  even  worse  circumstances  for  the  people  and  deepened  the  sense  of  paralysis  and  inferiority  in  that  part  of  the  world <period> for  decades <comma> we  have  lived  under  authoritarian  regimes <comma> in  the  arab  world <comma> in  the  middle  east <period> these  regimes  created  something  within  us  during  this  period <period> i  'm  43  years  old  right  now <period> for  the  last  40  years <comma> i  have  seen  almost  the  same  faces  for  kings  and  presidents  ruling  us <comma> old <comma> aged <comma> authoritarian <comma> corrupt  situations <comma> regimes  that  we  have  seen  around  us <period> and  for  a  moment  i  was  wondering <comma> are  we  going  to  live  in  order  to  see  real  change  happening  on  the  ground <comma> a  change  that  does  not  come  through  foreign  intervention <comma> through  the  misery  of  occupation <comma> through  nations  invading  our  land  and  deepening  the  sense  of  inferiority  sometimes <questionmark> the  iraqis <comma> yes <comma> they  got  rid  of  saddam  hussein <comma> but  when  they  saw  their  land  occupied  by  foreign  forces  they  felt  very  sad <comma> they  felt  that  their  dignity  had  suffered <period> and  this  is  why  they  revolted <period> this  is  why  they  did  not  accept <period> and  actually  other  regimes <comma> they  told  their  citizens <comma> would  you  like  to  see  the  situation  of  iraq <questionmark> would  you  like  to  see  civil  war <comma> sectarian  killing <questionmark> would  you  like  to  see  destruction <questionmark> would  you  like  to  see  foreign  troops  on  your  land  and  the  people  thought  for  themselves <comma> maybe  we  should  live  with  this  kind  of  authoritarian  situation  that  we  find  ourselves  in <comma> instead  of  having  the  second  scenario  that  was  one  of  the  worst  nightmares  that  we  have  seen <period> for  10  years <comma> unfortunately  we  have  found  ourselves  reporting  images  of  destruction <comma> images  of  killing <comma> of  sectarian  conflicts <comma> images  of  violence <comma> emerging  from  a  magnificent  piece  of  land <comma> a  region  that  one  day  was  the  source  of  civilizations  and  art  and  culture  for  thousands  of  years <period> now  i  am  here  to  tell  you  that  the  future  that  we  were  dreaming  for  has  eventually  arrived <period> a  new  generation <comma> well-educated <comma> connected <comma> inspired  by  universal  values  and  a  global  understanding <comma> has  created  a  new  reality  for  us <period> we  have  found  a  new  way  to  express  our  feelings  and  to  express  our  dreams: <period> these  young  people  who  have  restored  self-confidence  in  our  nations  in  that  part  of  the  world <comma> who  have  given  us  new  meaning  for  freedom  and  empowered  us  to  go  down  to  the  streets <period> nothing  happened <period> no  violence <period> nothing <period> just  step  out  of  your  house <comma> raise  your  voice  and  say <comma> we  would  like  to  see  the  end  of  the  regime  this  is  what  happened  in  tunisia <period> over  a  few  days <comma> the  tunisian  regime  that  invested  billions  of  dollars  in  the  security  agencies <comma> billions  of  dollars  in  maintaining <comma> trying  to  maintain <comma> its  prisons <comma> collapsed <comma> disappeared <comma> because  of  the  voices  of  the  public <period> people  who  were  inspired  to  go  down  to  the  streets  and  to  raise  their  voices <comma> they  tried  to  kill <period> the  intelligence  agencies  wanted  to  arrest  people <period> they  found  something  called  facebook <period> they  found  something  called  twitter <period> they  were  surprised  by  all  of  these  kinds  of  issues <period> and  they  said <comma> these  kids  are  misled  therefore <comma> they  asked  their  parents  to  go  down  to  the  streets  and  collect  them <comma> bring  them  back  home <period> this  is  what  they  were  telling <period> this  is  their  propaganda <period> bring  these  kids  home  because  they  are  misled  but  yes <comma> these  youth  who  have  been  inspired  by  universal  values <comma> who  are  idealistic  enough  to  imagine  a  magnificent  future  and <comma> at  the  same  time <comma> realistic  enough  to  balance  this  kind  of  imagination  and  the  process  leading  to  it <comma> not  using  violence <comma> not  trying  to  create  chaos  -- <period> these  young  people <comma> they  did  not  go  home <period> parents  actually  went  to  the  streets  and  they  supported  them <period> and  this  is  how  the  revolution  was  born  in  tunisia <period> we  in  al  jazeera  were  banned  from  tunisia  for  years <comma> and  the  government  did  not  allow  any  al  jazeera  reporter  to  be  there <period> but  we  found  that  these  people  in  the  street <comma> all  of  them  are  our  reporters <comma> feeding  our  newsroom  with  pictures <comma> with  videos  and  with  news <period> and  suddenly  that  newsroom  in  doha  became  a  center  that  received  all  this  kind  of  input  from  ordinary  people <comma> people  who  are  connected  and  people  who  have  ambition  and  who  have  liberated  themselves  from  the  feeling  of  inferiority <period> and  then  we  took  that  decision <comma> we  are  unrolling  the  news <period> we  are  going  to  be  the  voice  for  these  voiceless  people <period> we  are  going  to  spread  the  message <period> yes <comma> some  of  these  young  people  are  connected  to  the  internet <comma> but  the  connectivity  in  the  arab  world  is  very  little <comma> is  very  small <comma> because  of  many  problems  that  we  are  suffering  from <period> but  al  jazeera  took  the  voice  from  these  people  and  we  amplified  it <period> we  put  it  in  every  sitting  room  in  the  arab  world <comma> and  internationally <comma> globally <comma> through  our  english  channel <period> and  then  people  started  to  feel  that  there  's  something  new  happening <period> and  then  zine  al-abidine  ben  ali  decided  to  leave <period> and  then  egypt  started <comma> and  hosni  mubarak  decided  to  leave <period> and  now  libya  as  you  see  it <period> and  then  you  have  yemen <period> and  you  have  many  other  countries  trying  to  see  and  to  rediscover  that  feeling  of <comma> how  do  we  imagine  a  future  which  is  magnificent  and  peaceful  and  tolerant  i  want  to  tell  you  something <comma> that  the  internet  and  connectivity  has  created  a  new  mindset <period> but  this  mindset  has  continued  to  be  faithful  to  the  soil  and  to  the  land  that  it  emerged  from <period> and  while  this  was  the  major  difference  between  many  initiatives  before  to  create  change <comma> before  we  thought <comma> and  governments  told  us <comma> and  even  sometimes  it  was  true <comma> that  change  was  imposed  on  us <comma> and  people  rejected  that <comma> because  they  thought  that  it  is  alien  to  their  culture <period> always <comma> we  believed  that  change  will  spring  from  within <comma> that  change  should  be  a  reconciliation  with  culture <comma> cultural  diversity <comma> with  our  faith  in  our  tradition  and  in  our  history <comma> but  at  the  same  time <comma> open  to  universal  values <comma> connected  with  the  world <comma> tolerant  to  the  outside <period> and  this  is  the  moment  that  is  happening  right  now  in  the  arab  world <period> this  is  the  right  moment <comma> and  this  is  the  actual  moment  that  we  see  all  of  these  meanings  meet  together  and  then  create  the  beginning  of  this  magnificent  era  that  will  emerge  from  the  region <period> how  did  the  elite  deal  with  that <comma> the  so-called  political  elite <questionmark> in  front  of  facebook <comma> they  brought  the  camels  in  tahrir  square <period> in  front  of  al  jazeera <comma> they  started  creating  tribalism <period> and  then  when  they  failed <comma> they  started  speaking  about  conspiracies  that  emerged  from  tel  aviv  and  washington  in  order  to  divide  the  arab  world <period> they  started  telling  the  west <comma> be  aware  of  al-qaeda <period> al-qaeda  is  taking  over  our  territories <period> these  are  islamists  trying  to  create  new  imaras <period> be  aware  of  these  people  who  are  coming  to  you  in  order  to  ruin  your  great  civilization  fortunately <comma> people  right  now  cannot  be  deceived <period> because  this  corrupt  elite  in  that  region  has  lost  even  the  power  of  deception <period> they  could  not <comma> and  they  cannot <comma> imagine  how  they  could  really  deal  with  this  reality <period> they  have  lost <period> they  have  been  detached  from  their  people <comma> from  the  masses <comma> and  now  we  are  seeing  them  collapsing  one  after  the  other <period> al  jazeera  is  not  a  tool  of  revolution <period> we  do  not  create  revolutions <period> however <comma> when  something  of  that  magnitude  happens <comma> we  are  at  the  center  of  the  coverage <period> we  were  banned  from  egypt <comma> and  our  correspondents <comma> some  of  them  were  arrested <period> but  most  of  our  camera  people  and  our  journalists <comma> they  went  underground  in  egypt <comma> voluntarily <comma> to  report  what  happened  in  tahrir  square <period> for  18  days <comma> our  cameras  were  broadcasting <comma> live <comma> the  voices  of  the  people  in  tahrir  square <period> i  remember  one  night  when  someone  phoned  me  on  my  cellphone <comma> ordinary  person  who  i  do  n't  know <comma> from  tahrir  square <period> he  told  me <comma> we  appeal  to  you  not  to  switch  off  the  cameras <period> if  you  switch  off  the  cameras  tonight <comma> there  will  be  a  genocide <period> you  are  protecting  us  by  showing  what  is  happening  at  tahrir  square  i  felt  the  responsibility  to  phone  our  correspondents  there  and  to  phone  our  newsroom  and  to  tell  them <comma> make  your  best  not  to  switch  off  the  cameras  at  night <comma> because  the  guys  there  really  feel  confident  when  someone  is  reporting  their  story <comma> and  they  feel  protected  as  well  so  we  have  a  chance  to  create  a  new  future  in  that  part  of  the  world <period> we  have  a  chance  to  go  and  to  think  of  the  future  as  something  which  is  open  to  the  world <period> let  us  not  repeat  the  mistake  of  iran <comma> of  the  mosaddeq  revolution <period> let  us  free  ourselves <comma> especially  in  the  west <comma> from  thinking  about  that  part  of  the  world  based  on  oil  interest <comma> or  based  on  interests  of  the  illusion  of  stability  and  security <period> the  stability  and  security  of  authoritarian  regimes  cannot  create  but  terrorism  and  violence  and  destruction <period> let  us  accept  the  choice  of  the  people <period> let  us  not  pick  and  choose  who  we  would  like  to  rule  their  future <period> the  future  should  be  ruled  by  people  themselves <comma> even  sometimes  if  they  are  voices  that  might  now  scare  us <period> but  the  values  of  democracy  and  the  freedom  of  choice  that  is  sweeping  the  middle  east  at  this  moment  in  time  is  the  best  opportunity  for  the  world <comma> for  the  west  and  the  east <comma> to  see  stability  and  to  see  security  and  to  see  friendship  and  to  see  tolerance  emerging  from  the  arab  world <comma> rather  than  the  images  of  violence  and  terrorism <period> let  us  support  these  people <period> let  us  stand  for  them <period> and  let  us  give  up  our  narrow  selfishness  in  order  to  embrace  change <comma> and  in  order  to  celebrate  with  the  people  of  that  region  a  great  future  and  hope  and  tolerance <period> the  future  has  arrived <comma> and  the  future  is  now <period> i  thank  you  very  much <period> thank  you  very  much <period> chris  anderson <comma> i  just  have  a  couple  of  questions  for  you <period> thank  you  for  coming  here <period> how  would  you  characterize  the  historical  significance  of  what  's  happened <questionmark> is  this  a  story-of-the-year <comma> a  story-of-the-decade  or  something  more <questionmark> wadah  khanfar <comma> actually <comma> this  may  be  the  biggest  story  that  we  have  ever  covered <period> we  have  covered  many  wars <period> we  have  covered  a  lot  of  tragedies <comma> a  lot  of  problems <comma> a  lot  of  conflict  zones <comma> a  lot  of  hot  spots  in  the  region <comma> because  we  were  centered  at  the  middle  of  it <period> but  this  is  a  story <comma> it  is  a  great  story <period> it  is  beautiful <period> it  is  not  something  that  you  only  cover  because  you  have  to  cover  a  great  incident <period> you  are  witnessing  change  in  history <period> you  are  witnessing  the  birth  of  a  new  era <period> and  this  is  what  the  story  's  all  about <period> ca <comma> there  are  a  lot  of  people  in  the  west  who  are  still  skeptical <comma> or  think  this  may  just  be  an  intermediate  stage  before  much  more  alarming  chaos <period> you  really  believe  that  if  there  are  democratic  elections  in  egypt  now <comma> that  a  government  could  emerge  that  espouses  some  of  the  values  you've  spoken  about  so  inspiringly <questionmark> wk <comma> and  people  actually <comma> after  the  collapse  of  the  hosni  mubarak  regime <comma> the  youth  who  have  organized  themselves  in  certain  groups  and  councils <comma> they  are  guarding  the  transformation  and  they  are  trying  to  put  it  on  a  track  in  order  to  satisfy  the  values  of  democracy <comma> but  at  the  same  time  also  to  make  it  reasonable  and  to  make  it  rational <comma> not  to  go  out  of  order <period> in  my  opinion <comma> these  people  are  much  more  wiser  than <comma> not  only  the  political  elite <comma> even  the  intellectual  elite <comma> even  opposition  leaders  including  political  parties <period> at  this  moment  in  time <comma> the  youth  in  the  arab  world  are  much  more  wiser  and  capable  of  creating  the  change  than  the  old <comma> including  the  political  and  cultural  and  ideological  old  regimes <period> ca <comma> we  are  not  to  get  involved  politically  and  interfere  in  that  way <period> what  should  people  here  at  ted <comma> here  in  the  west <comma> do  if  they  want  to  connect  or  make  a  difference  and  they  believe  in  what  's  happening  here <questionmark> wk <comma> i  think  we  have  discovered  a  very  important  issue  in  the  arab  world <comma> that  people  care <comma> people  care  about  this  great  transformation <period> mohamed  nanabhay  who  's  sitting  with  us <comma> the  head  of  aljazeeranet <comma> he  told  me  that  a  2,500  percent  increase  of  accessing  our  website  from  various  parts  of  the  world <period> fifty  percent  of  it  is  coming  from  america <period> because  we  discovered  that  people  care <comma> and  people  would  like  to  know <comma> they  are  receiving  the  stream  through  our  internet <period> unfortunately  in  the  united  states <comma> we  are  not  covering  but  washington  dc <period> at  this  moment  in  time  for  al  jazeera  english <period> but  i  can  tell  you <comma> this  is  the  moment  to  celebrate  through  connecting  ourselves  with  those  people  in  the  street  and  expressing  our  support  to  them  and  expressing  this  kind  of  feeling <comma> universal  feeling <comma> of  supporting  the  weak  and  the  oppressed  to  create  a  much  better  future  for  all  of  us <period> ca <comma> well  wadah <comma> a  group  of  members  of  the  ted  community <comma> tedxcairo <comma> are  meeting  as  we  speak <period> they've  had  some  speakers  there <period> i  believe  they've  heard  your  talk <period> thank  you  for  inspiring  them  and  for  inspiring  all  of  us <period> thank  you  so  much <period> pat  mitchell <comma> what  is  the  story  of  this  pin <questionmark> madeleine  albright <comma> this  is  breaking  the  glass  ceiling <period> pm <comma> oh <period> that  was  well  chosen <comma> i  would  say <comma> for  tedwomen <period> ma <comma> most  of  the  time  i  spend  when  i  get  up  in  the  morning  is  trying  to  figure  out  what  is  going  to  happen <period> and  none  of  this  pin  stuff  would  have  happened  if  it  had  n't  been  for  saddam  hussein <period> i  'll  tell  you  what  happened <period> i  went  to  the  united  nations  as  an  ambassador <period> and  it  was  after  the  gulf  war <period> and  i  was  an  instructed  ambassador <period> and  the  cease-fire  had  been  translated  into  a  series  of  sanctions  resolutions <comma> and  my  instructions  were  to  say  perfectly  terrible  things  about  saddam  hussein  constantly <comma> which  he  deserved <comma> he  had  invaded  another  country <period> and  so  all  of  a  sudden <comma> a  poem  appeared  in  the  papers  in  baghdad  comparing  me  to  many  things <comma> but  among  them  an  unparalleled  serpent <period> and  so  i  happened  to  have  a  snake  pin <period> so  i  wore  it  when  we  talked  about  iraq <period> and  when  i  went  out  to  meet  the  press <comma> they  zeroed  in <comma> said <comma> why  are  you  wearing  that  snake  pin <questionmark> i  said <comma> because  saddam  hussein  compared  me  to  an  unparalleled  serpent <period> and  then  i  thought <comma> well  this  is  fun <period> so  i  went  out  and  i  bought  a  lot  of  pins  that  would <comma> in  fact <comma> reflect  what  i  thought  we  were  going  to  do  on  any  given  day <period> so  that  's  how  it  all  started <period> pm <comma> so  how  large  is  the  collection <questionmark> ma <comma> pretty  big <period> it  's  now  traveling <period> at  the  moment  it  's  in  indianapolis <comma> but  it  was  at  the  smithsonian <period> and  it  goes  with  a  book  that  says <comma> read  my  pins  pm <comma> so  is  this  a  good  idea <period> i  remember  when  you  were  the  first  woman  as  secretary  of  state <comma> and  there  was  a  lot  of  conversation  always  about  what  you  were  wearing <comma> how  you  looked <comma> the  thing  that  happens  to  a  lot  of  women <comma> especially  if  they  're  the  first  in  a  position <period> so  how  do  you  feel  about  that <comma> the  whole  -- <period> ma <comma> well <comma> it  's  pretty  irritating  actually  because  nobody  ever  describes  what  a  man  is  wearing <period> but  people  did  pay  attention  to  what  clothes  i  had <period> what  was  interesting  was  that <comma> before  i  went  up  to  new  york  as  un <period> ambassador <comma> i  talked  to  jeane  kirkpatrick <comma> who'd  been  ambassador  before  me <comma> and  she  said <comma> you've  got  to  get  rid  of  your  professor  clothes <period> go  out  and  look  like  a  diplomat <period> so  that  did  give  me  a  lot  of  opportunities  to  go  shopping <period> but  still <comma> there  were  all  kinds  of  questions  about <comma> did  you  wear  a  hat  how  short  was  your  skirt <questionmark> and  one  of  the  things <comma> if  you  remember  condoleezza  rice  was  at  some  event  and  she  wore  boots <comma> and  she  got  criticized  over  that <period> and  no  guy  ever  gets  criticized <period> but  that  's  the  least  of  it <period> pm <comma> it  is <comma> for  all  of  us <comma> men  and  women <comma> finding  our  ways  of  defining  our  roles <comma> and  doing  them  in  ways  that  make  a  difference  in  the  world  and  shape  the  future <period> how  did  you  handle  that  balance  between  being  the  tough  diplomatic  and  strong  voice  of  this  country  to  the  rest  of  the  world  and  also  how  you  felt  about  yourself  as  a  mother <comma> a  grandmother <comma> nurturing <period> and  so  how  did  you  handle  that <questionmark> ma <comma> well  the  interesting  part  was  i  was  asked  what  it  was  like  to  be  the  first  woman  secretary  of  state  a  few  minutes  after  i'd  been  named <period> and  i  said <comma> well  i've  been  a  woman  for  60  years <comma> but  i've  only  been  secretary  of  state  for  a  few  minutes <period> so  it  evolved <period> but  basically  i  love  being  a  woman <period> and  so  what  happened <comma> and  i  think  there  will  probably  be  some  people  in  the  audience  that  will  identify  with  this <comma> i  went  to  my  first  meeting <comma> first  at  the  un <comma> and  that  's  when  this  all  started <comma> because  that  is  a  very  male  organization <period> and  i  'm  sitting  there <comma> there  are  15  members  of  the  security  council <comma> so  14  men  sat  there  staring  at  me <comma> and  i  thought <comma> well  you  know  how  we  all  are <period> you  want  to  get  the  feeling  of  the  room <comma> and  do  people  like  me  and  will  i  really  say  something  intelligent <questionmark> and  all  of  a  sudden  i  thought <comma> well <comma> wait  a  minute <period> i  am  sitting  behind  a  sign  that  says  the  united  states,' <period> and  if  i  do  n't  speak  today  then  the  voice  of  the  united  states  will  not  be  heard <period> and  it  was  the  first  time  that  i  had  that  feeling  that  i  had  to  step  out  of  myself  in  my  normal <comma> reluctant  female  mode  and  decide  that  i  had  to  speak  on  behalf  of  our  country <period> and  so  that  happened  more  at  various  times <comma> but  i  really  think  that  there  was  a  great  advantage  in  many  ways  to  being  a  woman <period> i  think  we  are  a  lot  better  at  personal  relationships <comma> and  then  have  the  capability  obviously  of  telling  it  like  it  is  when  it  's  necessary <period> but  i  have  to  tell  you <comma> i  have  my  youngest  granddaughter <comma> when  she  turned  seven  last  year <comma> said  to  her  mother <comma> my  daughter <comma> so  what  's  the  big  deal  about  grandma  maddie  being  secretary  of  state <questionmark> only  girls  are  secretary  of  state <period> pm <comma> because  in  her  lifetime <comma> ma <comma> that  would  be  so <period> as  you  travel  now  all  over  the  world <comma> which  you  do  frequently <comma> how  do  you  assess  this  global  narrative  around  the  story  of  women  and  girls <questionmark> where  are  we <questionmark> ma <comma> i  think  we  're  slowly  changing <comma> but  obviously  there  are  whole  pockets  in  countries  where  nothing  is  different <period> and  therefore  it  means  that  we  have  to  remember  that <comma> while  many  of  us  have  had  huge  opportunities <comma> and  pat <comma> you  have  been  a  real  leader  in  your  field <comma> is  that  there  are  a  lot  of  women  that  are  not  capable  of  worrying  and  taking  care  of  themselves  and  understanding  that  women  have  to  help  other  women <period> and  so  what  i  have  felt <comma> and  i  have  looked  at  this  from  a  national  security  issue <comma> when  i  was  secretary  of  state <comma> i  decided  that  women  's  issues  had  to  be  central  to  american  foreign  policy <comma> not  just  because  i  'm  a  feminist <comma> but  because  i  believe  that  societies  are  better  off  when  women  are  politically  and  economically  empowered <comma> that  values  are  passed  down <comma> the  health  situation  is  better <comma> education  is  better <comma> there  is  greater  economic  prosperity <period> so  i  think  that  it  behooves  us <comma> those  of  us  that  live  in  various  countries  where  we  do  have  economic  and  political  voice <comma> that  we  need  to  help  other  women <period> and  i  really  dedicated  myself  to  that <comma> both  at  the  un <period> and  then  as  secretary  of  state <period> pm <comma> and  did  you  get  pushback  from  making  that  a  central  tenant  of  foreign  policy <questionmark> ma <comma> from  some  people <period> i  think  that  they  thought  that  it  was  a  soft  issue <period> the  bottom  line  that  i  decided  was  actually  women  's  issues  are  the  hardest  issues <comma> because  they  are  the  ones  that  have  to  do  with  life  and  death  in  so  many  aspects <comma> and  because <comma> as  i  said <comma> it  is  really  central  to  the  way  that  we  think  about  things <period> now  for  instance <comma> some  of  the  wars  that  took  place  when  i  was  in  office <comma> a  lot  of  them <comma> the  women  were  the  main  victims  of  it <period> for  instance <comma> when  i  started <comma> there  were  wars  in  the  balkans <period> the  women  in  bosnia  were  being  raped <period> we  then  managed  to  set  up  a  war  crimes  tribunal  to  deal  specifically  with  those  kinds  of  issues <period> and  by  the  way <comma> one  of  the  things  that  i  did  at  that  stage  was <comma> i  had  just  arrived  at  the  un <comma> and  when  i  was  there <comma> there  were  183  countries  in  the  un <period> now  there  are  192 <period> but  it  was  one  of  the  first  times  that  i  did  n't  have  to  cook  lunch  myself <period> so  i  said  to  my  assistant <comma> invite  the  other  women  permanent  representatives <period> and  i  thought  when  i'd  get  to  my  apartment  that  there'd  be  a  lot  of  women  there <period> i  get  there <comma> and  there  are  six  other  women <comma> out  of  183 <period> so  the  countries  that  had  women  representatives  were  canada <comma> kazakhstan <comma> philippines <comma> trinidad  tobago <comma> jamaica <comma> lichtenstein  and  me <period> so  being  an  american <comma> i  decided  to  set  up  a  caucus <period> and  so  we  set  it  up <comma> and  we  called  ourselves  the  g7 <period> pm <comma> is  that  girl  7  ma <comma> girl  7 <period> and  we  lobbied  on  behalf  of  women  's  issues <period> so  we  managed  to  get  two  women  judges  on  this  war  crimes  tribunal <period> and  then  what  happened  was  that  they  were  able  to  declare  that  rape  was  a  weapon  of  war <comma> that  it  was  against  humanity <period> pm <comma> so  when  you  look  around  the  world  and  you  see  that <comma> in  many  cases <comma> certainly  in  the  western  world <comma> women  are  evolving  into  more  leadership  positions <comma> and  even  other  places  some  barriers  are  being  brought  down <comma> but  there  's  still  so  much  violence <comma> still  so  many  problems <comma> and  yet  we  hear  there  are  more  women  at  the  negotiating  tables <period> now  you  were  at  those  negotiating  tables  when  they  were  n't <comma> when  there  was  maybe  you <comma> one  voice <comma> maybe  one  or  two  others <period> do  you  believe <comma> and  can  you  tell  us  why <comma> there  is  going  to  be  a  significant  shift  in  things  like  violence  and  peace  and  conflict  and  resolution  on  a  sustainable  basis <questionmark> ma <comma> well  i  do  think <comma> when  there  are  more  women <comma> that  the  tone  of  the  conversation  changes <comma> and  also  the  goals  of  the  conversation  change <period> but  it  does  n't  mean  that  the  whole  world  would  be  a  lot  better  if  it  were  totally  run  by  women <period> if  you  think  that <comma> you've  forgotten  high  school <period> but  the  bottom  line  is  that  there  is  a  way <comma> when  there  are  more  women  at  the  table <comma> that  there  's  an  attempt  to  develop  some  understanding <period> so  for  instance <comma> what  i  did  when  i  went  to  burundi <comma> we'd  got  tutsi  and  hutu  women  together  to  talk  about  some  of  the  problems  that  had  taken  place  in  rwanda <period> and  so  i  think  the  capability  of  women  to  put  themselves <comma> i  think  we  're  better  about  putting  ourselves  into  the  other  guy  's  shoes <period> and  having  more  empathy <period> i  think  it  helps  in  terms  of  the  support  if  there  are  other  women  in  the  room <period> when  i  was  secretary  of  state <comma> there  were  only  13  other  women  foreign  ministers <period> and  so  it  was  nice  when  one  of  them  would  show  up <period> for  instance <comma> she  is  now  the  president  of  finland <comma> but  tarja  halonen  was  the  foreign  minister  of  finland  and <comma> at  a  certain  stage <comma> head  of  the  european  union <period> and  it  was  really  terrific <period> because  one  of  the  things  i  think  you  'll  understand <period> we  went  to  a  meeting <comma> and  the  men  in  my  delegation <comma> when  i  would  say <comma> well  i  feel  we  should  do  something  about  this <comma> and  they'd  say <comma> what  do  you  mean <comma> you  feel <questionmark> and  so  then  tarja  was  sitting  across  the  table  from  me <period> and  all  of  a  sudden  we  were  talking  about  arms  control <comma> and  she  said <comma> well  i  feel  we  should  do  this <period> and  my  male  colleagues  kind  of  got  it  all  of  a  sudden <period> but  i  think  it  really  does  help  to  have  a  critical  mass  of  women  in  a  series  of  foreign  policy  positions <period> the  other  thing  that  i  think  is  really  important <comma> a  lot  of  national  security  policy  is  n't  just  about  foreign  policy <comma> but  it  's  about  budgets <comma> military  budgets <comma> and  how  the  debts  of  countries  work  out <period> so  if  you  have  women  in  a  variety  of  foreign  policy  posts <comma> they  can  support  each  other  when  there  are  budget  decisions  being  made  in  their  own  countries <period> pm <comma> so  how  do  we  get  this  balance  we  're  looking  for <comma> then <comma> in  the  world <questionmark> more  women  's  voices  at  the  table <questionmark> more  men  who  believe  that  the  balance  is  best <questionmark> ma <comma> well  i  think  one  of  the  things <comma> i  'm  chairman  of  the  board  of  an  organization  called  the  national  democratic  institute  that  works  to  support  women  candidates <period> i  think  that  we  need  to  help  in  other  countries  to  train  women  to  be  in  political  office <comma> to  figure  out  how  they  can  in  fact  develop  political  voices <period> i  think  we  also  need  to  be  supportive  when  businesses  are  being  created  and  just  make  sure  that  women  help  each  other <period> now  i  have  a  saying  that  i  feel  very  strongly  about <comma> because  i  am  of  a  certain  age  where <comma> when  i  started  in  my  career <comma> believe  it  or  not <comma> there  were  other  women  who  criticized  me <comma> why  are  n't  you  in  the  carpool  line <questionmark> or  are  n't  your  children  suffering  because  you  're  not  there  all  the  time <questionmark> and  i  think  we  have  a  tendency  to  make  each  other  feel  guilty <period> in  fact <comma> i  think  guilt  is  every  woman  's  middle  name <period> and  so  i  think  what  needs  to  happen  is  we  need  to  help  each  other <period> and  my  motto  is  that  there  's  a  special  place  in  hell  for  women  who  do  n't  help  each  other <period> pm <comma> well  secretary  albright <comma> i  guess  you  'll  be  going  to  heaven <period> thank  you  for  joining  us  today <period> ma <comma> thank  you  all <period> thanks  pat <period> i  'm  going  to  try  to  give  you  a  view  of  the  world  as  i  see  it <comma> the  problems  and  the  opportunities  that  we  face <comma> and  then  ask  the  question  if  we  should  be  optimistic  or  pessimistic <period> and  then  i  'll  let  you  in  on  a  secret <comma> which  is  why  i  am  an  incurable  optimist <period> let  me  start  off  showing  you  an  al  gore  movie  that  you  may  have  seen  before <period> now <comma> you've  all  seen  inconvenient  truth  this  is  a  little  more  inconvenient <period>  <comma> man <period> extremely  dangerous  questions <period> because <comma> with  our  present  knowledge <comma> we  have  no  idea  what  would  happen <period> even  now <comma> man  may  be  unwittingly  changing  the  world  's  climate  through  the  waste  products  of  his  civilization <period> due  to  our  release <comma> through  factories  and  automobiles  every  year <comma> of  more  than  six  billion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide <comma> which  helps  air  absorb  heat  from  the  sun <comma> our  atmosphere  seems  to  be  getting  warmer <period> this  is  bad <questionmark> well <comma> it  's  been  calculated  a  few  degrees  rise  in  the  earth  's  temperature  would  melt  the  polar  ice  caps <period> and  if  this  happens <comma> an  inland  sea  would  fill  a  good  portion  of  the  mississippi  valley <period> tourists  in  glass-bottomed  boats  would  be  viewing  the  drowned  towers  of  miami  through  150  feet  of  tropical  water <period> for <comma> in  weather <comma> we  're  not  only  dealing  with  forces  of  a  far  greater  variety  than  even  the  atomic  physicist  encounters <comma> but  with  life  itself <period> larry  brilliant <comma> should  we  feel  good <comma> or  should  we  feel  bad  that  50  years  of  foreknowledge  accomplished  so  little <questionmark> well <comma> it  depends <comma> really <comma> on  what  your  goals  are <period> and  i  think <comma> as  my  goals <comma> i  always  go  back  to  gandhi  's  talisman <period> when  mahatma  gandhi  was  asked <comma> how  do  you  know  if  the  next  act  that  you  are  about  to  do  is  the  right  one  or  the  wrong  one  he  said <comma> consider  the  face  of  the  poorest <comma> most  vulnerable  human  being  that  you  ever  chanced  upon <comma> and  ask  yourself  if  the  act  that  you  contemplate  will  be  of  benefit  to  that  person <period> and  if  it  will  be <comma> it  's  the  right  thing  to  do <comma> and  if  not <comma> rethink  it <period> for  those  of  us  in  this  room <comma> it  's  not  just  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable  individual <comma> it  's  the  community <comma> it  's  the  culture <comma> it  's  the  world  itself <period> and  the  trends  for  those  who  are  at  the  periphery  of  our  society <comma> who  are  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable <comma> the  trends  give  rise  to  a  great  case  for  pessimism <period> but  there  's  also  a  wonderful  case  for  optimism <period> let  's  review  them  both <period> first  of  all <comma> the  megatrends <period> there  's  two  degrees <comma> or  three  degrees  of  climate  change  baked  into  the  system <period> it  will  cause  rising  seas <period> it  will  cause  saline  deposited  into  wells  and  into  lands <period> it  will  disproportionately  harm  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable <comma> as  will  the  increasing  rise  of  population <period> even  though  we've  dodged  paul  ehrlich  's  population  bomb <comma> and  we  will  not  see  20  billion  people  in  this  decade <comma> as  he  had  forecast <comma> we  eat  as  if  we  were  20  billion <period> and  we  consume  so  much  that  again <comma> a  rise  of  65  billion  to  95  billion  in  our  grandchildren  's  lifetime  will  disproportionately  hurt  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable <period> that  's  why  they  migrate  to  cities <period> that  's  why  in  june  of  this  year <comma> we  passed <comma> as  a  species <comma> 51  percent  of  us  living  in  cities <comma> and  bustees <comma> and  slums <comma> and  shantytowns <period> the  rural  areas  are  no  longer  producing  as  much  food  as  they  did <period> the  green  revolution  never  reached  africa <period> and  with  desertification <comma> sandstorms <comma> the  gobi  desert <comma> the  ogaden <comma> we  are  finding  increasing  difficulty  of  a  hectare  to  produce  as  many  calories  as  it  did  even  15  years  ago <period> so  humans  are  turning  more  towards  animal  consumption <period> in  africa  last  year <comma> africans  ate  600  million  wild  animals <comma> and  consumed  two  billion  kilograms  of  bush  meat <period> and  every  kilogram  of  bush  meat  contained  hundreds  of  thousands  of  novel  viruses  that  have  never  been  charted <comma> the  genomic  sequences  of  which  we  do  n't  know <period> their  fitness  for  creating  pandemics  we  are  unaware  of <comma> but  we  are  ripe  for  zoonotic-borne <comma> emerging  communicable  diseases <period> increasingly <comma> i  would  say  explosive  growth  of  technology <period> most  of  us  are  the  beneficiaries  of  that  growth <period> but  it  has  a  dark  side <comma> in  bioweapons <comma> and  in  technology  that  puts  us  on  a  collision  course  to  magnify  any  anger <comma> hatred  or  feeling  of  marginalization <period> and  in  fact <comma> with  increasing  globalization <comma> for  which  there  are  big  winners  and  even  bigger  losers <comma> today  the  world  is  more  diverse  and  unfair  than  perhaps  it  has  ever  been  in  history <period> one  percent  of  us  own  40  percent  of  all  the  goods  and  services <period> what  will  happen  if  the  billion  people  today  who  live  on  less  than  one  dollar  a  day  rise  to  three  billion  in  the  next  30  years <questionmark> the  one  percent  will  own  even  more  than  40  percent  of  all  the  world  's  goods  and  services <period> not  because  they've  grown  richer <comma> but  because  the  rest  of  the  world  has  grown  increasingly  poorer <period> last  week <comma> bill  clinton  at  the  ted  awards  said <comma> this  situation  is  unprecedented <comma> unequal <comma> unfair  and  unstable <period> so  there  's  lots  of  reason  for  pessimism <period> darfur  is <comma> at  its  origin <comma> a  resource  war <period> last  year <comma> there  were  85,000  riots  in  china <comma> 230  a  day <comma> that  required  police  or  military  intervention <period> most  of  them  were  about  resources <period> we  are  facing  an  unprecedented  number <comma> scale  of  disasters <period> some  are  weather-related <comma> human-rights  related <comma> epidemics <period> and  the  newly  emerging  diseases  may  make  h5n1  and  bird  flu  a  quaint  forerunner  of  things  to  come <period> it  's  a  destabilized  world <period> and  unlike  destabilized  world  in  the  past <comma> it  will  be  broadcast  to  you  on  youtube <comma> you  will  see  it  on  digital  television  and  on  your  cell  phones <period> what  will  that  lead  to <questionmark> for  some <comma> it  will  lead  to  anger <comma> religious  and  sectarian  violence  and  terrorism <period> for  others <comma> withdrawal <comma> nihilism <comma> materialism <period> for  us <comma> where  does  it  take  us <comma> as  social  activists  and  entrepreneurs <questionmark> as  we  look  at  these  trends <comma> do  we  become  despondent <comma> or  will  we  become  energized <questionmark> let  's  look  at  one  case <comma> the  case  of  bangladesh <period> first <comma> even  if  carbon  dioxide  emissions  stopped  today <comma> global  warming  would  continue <period> and  even  with  global  warming <comma> if  you  can  see  these  blue  lines <comma> the  dotted  line  shows  that  even  if  emissions  of  greenhouse  gasses  stopped  today <comma> the  next  decades  will  see  rising  sea  levels <period> a  minimum  of  20  to  30  inches  of  increase  in  sea  levels  is  the  best  case  that  we  can  hope  for <comma> and  it  could  be  10  times  that <period> what  will  that  do  to  bangladesh <questionmark> let  's  take  a  look <period> so  here  's  bangladesh <period> 70  percent  of  bangladesh  is  at  less  than  five  feet  above  sea  level <period> let  's  go  up  and  take  a  look  at  the  himalayas <period> and  we  'll  watch  as  global  warming  makes  them  melt <period> more  water  comes  down <comma> the  deforested  areas <comma> here  in  the  tarai <comma> will  be  unable  to  absorb  the  effluent <comma> because  trees  are  like  straws  that  suck  up  the  extra  seasonal  water <period> now  we  're  looking  down  south <comma> through  the  kali  gandaki <period> many  of  you <comma> i  think <comma> have  probably  trekked  here <period> and  we  're  going  to  cruise  down  and  take  a  look  at  bangladesh  and  see  what  the  impact  will  be  of  twin  increases  in  water  coming  from  the  north <comma> and  in  the  seas  rising  from  the  south <period> looking  at  the  five  major  rivers  that  feed  bangladesh <period> and  now  let  's  look  from  the  south <comma> looking  up <comma> and  let  's  see  this  in  relief <period> a  minimum  of  20  to  40  inches  of  increase  in  seas <comma> coupled  with  increasing  flows  from  the  himalayas <period> and  take  a  look  at  this <period> as  many  as  100  million  refugees  from  bangladesh  could  be  expected  to  migrate  into  india  and  into  china <period> this  is  the  difficulty  that  one  country  faces <period> but  if  you  look  at  the  globe <comma> all  around  the  earth <comma> wherever  there  is  low-lying  area <comma> populated  areas  near  the  water <comma> you  will  find  increase  in  sea  level  that  will  challenge  our  way  of  life <period> sub-saharan  africa <comma> and  even  our  own  san  francisco  bay  area <period> we  're  all  in  this  together <period> this  is  not  something  that  happens  far  away  to  people  that  we  do  n't  know <period> global  warming  is  something  that  happens  to  all  of  us <comma> all  at  once <period> as  are  these  newly  emerging  communicable  diseases <comma> names  that  you  had  n't  heard  20  years  ago <comma> ebola <comma> lhasa  fever <comma> monkey  pox <period> with  the  erosion  of  the  green  belt  separating  animals  from  humans <comma> we  live  in  each  other  's  viral  environment <period> do  you  remember <comma> 20  years  ago <comma> no  one  had  ever  heard  of  west  nile  fever <questionmark> and  then  we  watched <comma> as  one  case  arrived  on  the  east  coast  of  the  united  states  and  it  marched  every  year <comma> westwardly <period> do  you  remember  no  one  had  heard  of  ebola  until  we  heard  of  hundreds  of  people  dying  in  central  africa  from  it <questionmark> it  's  just  the  beginning <comma> unfortunately <period> there  have  been  30  novel  emerging  communicable  diseases  that  begin  in  animals  that  have  jumped  species  in  the  last  30  years <period> it  's  more  than  enough  reason  for  pessimism <period> but  now  let  's  look  at  the  case  for  optimism <period> enough  of  the  bad  news <period> human  beings  have  always  risen  to  the  challenge <period> you  just  need  to  look  at  the  list  of  nobel  laureates  to  remind  ourselves <period> we've  been  here  before <comma> paralyzed  by  fear <comma> paralyzed  into  inaction <comma> when  some <comma> probably  one  of  you  in  this  room <comma> jumped  into  the  breach  and  created  an  organization  like  physicians  for  social  responsibility <comma> which  fought  against  the  nuclear  threat <comma> medicins  sans  frontieres <comma> that  renewed  our  commitment  to  disaster  relief <comma> mohamed  elbaradei <comma> and  the  tremendous  hope  and  optimism  that  he  brought  all  of  us <comma> and  our  own  muhammad  yunus <period> we've  seen  the  eradication  of  smallpox <period> we  may  see  the  eradication  of  polio  this  year <period> last  year <comma> there  were  only  2,000  cases  in  the  world <period> we  may  see  the  eradication  of  guinea  worm  next  year <comma> there  are  only  35,000  cases  left  in  the  world <period> 20  years  ago <comma> there  were  three  and  a  half  million <period> and  we've  seen  a  new  disease <comma> not  like  the  30  novel  emerging  communicable  diseases <period> this  disease  is  called  sudden  wealth  syndrome <period> it  's  an  amazing  phenomenon <period> all  throughout  the  technology  world <comma> we  're  seeing  young  people  bitten  by  this  disease  of  sudden  wealth  syndrome <period> but  they  're  using  their  wealth  in  a  way  that  their  forefathers  never  did <period> they  're  not  waiting  until  they  die  to  create  foundations <period> they  're  actively  guiding  their  money <comma> their  resources <comma> their  hearts <comma> their  commitments <comma> to  make  the  world  a  better  place <period> certainly <comma> nothing  can  give  you  more  optimism  than  that <period> more  reasons  to  be  optimistic <comma> in  the  60s <comma> and  i  am  a  creature  of  the  60s <comma> there  was  a  movement <period> we  all  felt  that  we  were  part  of  it <comma> that  a  better  world  was  right  around  the  corner <comma> that  we  were  watching  the  birth  of  a  world  free  of  hatred  and  violence  and  prejudice <period> today <comma> there  's  another  kind  of  movement <period> it  's  a  movement  to  save  the  earth <period> it  's  just  beginning <period> five  weeks  ago <comma> a  group  of  activists  from  the  business  community  gathered  together  to  stop  a  texas  utility  from  building  nine  coal-fired  electrical  plants  that  would  have  contributed  to  destroying  the  environment <period> six  months  ago <comma> a  group  of  business  activists  gathered  together  to  join  with  the  republican  governor  in  california  to  pass  ab  32 <comma> the  most  far-reaching  legislation  in  environmental  history <period> al  gore  made  presentations  in  the  house  and  the  senate  as  an  expert  witness <period> can  you  imagine <questionmark> we  're  seeing  an  entente  cordiale  between  science  and  religion  that  five  years  ago  i  would  not  have  believed <comma> as  the  evangelical  community  has  understood  the  desperate  situation  of  global  warming <period> and  now  4,000  churches  have  joined  the  environmental  movement <period> it  is  something  to  be  greatly  optimistic  about <period> the  european  20-20-20  plan  is  an  amazing  breakthrough <comma> something  that  should  make  all  of  us  feel  that  hope  is  on  the  horizon <period> and  on  april  14th <comma> there  will  be  step  up  day <comma> where  there  will  be  a  thousand  individual  mobilized  social  activist  movements  in  the  united  states  on  protest  against  legislation <comma> pushing  for  legislation  to  stop  global  warming <period> and  on  july  7th <comma> around  the  world <comma> i  learned  only  yesterday <comma> there  will  be  global  live  earth  concerts <period> and  you  can  feel  this  optimistic  move  to  save  the  earth  in  the  air <period> now <comma> that  does  n't  mean  that  people  understand  that  global  warming  hurts  the  poorest  and  the  weakest  the  most <period> that  means  that  people  are  beginning  the  first  step <comma> which  is  acting  out  of  their  own  self-interest <period> but  i  am  seeing  in  the  major  funders <comma> in  care <comma> rockefeller <comma> rockefeller  brothers  fund <comma> hewlett <comma> mercy  corps <comma> you  guys <comma> google <comma> so  many  other  organizations <comma> a  beginning  of  understanding  that  we  need  to  work  not  just  on  primary  prevention  of  global  warming <comma> but  on  the  secondary  prevention  of  the  consequences  of  global  warming  on  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable <period> but  for  me <comma> i  have  another  reason  to  be  an  incurable  optimist <period> and  you've  heard  so  many  inspiring  stories  here <comma> and  i  heard  so  many  last  night  that  i  thought  i  would  share  a  little  bit  of  mine <period> my  background  is  not  exactly  conventional  medical  training <period> and  i  lived  in  a  himalayan  monastery <comma> and  i  studied  with  a  very  wise  teacher <comma> who  kicked  me  out  of  the  monastery  one  day  and  told  me  that  it  was  my  destiny <comma> it  felt  like  yoda <comma> it  is  your  destiny  to  go  to  work  for  who  and  to  help  eradicate  smallpox <comma> at  a  time  when  there  was  no  smallpox  program <period> it  should  make  you  optimistic  that  smallpox  no  longer  exists  because  it  was  the  worst  disease  in  history <period> in  the  last  century <comma> that  's  the  one  that  was  seven  years  ago <comma> half  a  billion  people  died  from  smallpox: <period> more  than  all  the  wars  in  history <comma> more  than  any  other  infectious  disease  in  the  history  of  the  world <period> in  the  summer  of  love <comma> in  1967 <comma> two  million  people <comma> children <comma> died  of  smallpox <period> it  's  not  ancient  history <period> when  you  read  the  biblical  plague  of  boils <comma> that  was  smallpox <period> pharaoh  ramses  the  fifth <comma> whose  picture  is  here <comma> died  of  smallpox <period> to  eradicate  smallpox <comma> we  had  to  gather  the  largest  united  nations  army  in  history <period> we  visited  every  house  in  india <comma> searching  for  smallpox <comma> 120  million  houses <comma> once  every  month <comma> for  nearly  two  years <period> in  a  cruel  reversal <comma> after  we  had  almost  conquered  smallpox <comma> and  this  is  what  you  must  learn  as  a  social  entrepreneur <comma> the  realm  of  the  final  inch <period> when  we  had  almost  eradicated  smallpox <comma> it  came  back  again <comma> because  the  company  town  of  tatanagar  drew  laborers <comma> who  could  come  there  and  get  employment <period> and  they  caught  smallpox  in  the  one  remaining  place  that  had  smallpox <comma> and  they  went  home  to  die <period> and  when  they  did <comma> they  took  smallpox  to  10  other  countries  and  reignited  the  epidemic <period> and  we  had  to  start  all  over  again <period> but <comma> in  the  end <comma> we  succeeded <comma> and  the  last  case  of  smallpox <comma> this  little  girl <comma> rahima  banu <comma> barisal <comma> in  bangladesh <comma> when  she  coughed  or  breathed <comma> and  the  last  virus  of  smallpox  left  her  lungs  and  fell  on  the  dirt  and  the  sun  killed  that  last  virus <comma> thus  ended  a  chain  of  transmission  of  history  's  greatest  horror <period> how  can  that  not  make  you  optimistic <questionmark> a  disease  which  killed  hundreds  of  thousands  in  india <comma> and  blinded  half  of  all  of  those  who  were  made  blind  in  india <comma> ended <period> and  most  importantly  for  us  here  in  this  room <comma> a  bond  was  created <period> doctors <comma> health  workers <comma> from  30  different  countries <comma> of  every  race <comma> every  religion <comma> every  color <comma> worked  together <comma> fought  alongside  each  other <comma> fought  against  a  common  enemy <comma> did  n't  fight  against  each  other <period> how  can  that  not  make  you  feel  optimistic  for  the  future <questionmark> thank  you  very  much <period> /transcript <period> i  'm  an  ecologist <comma> mostly  a  coral  reef  ecologist <period> i  started  out  in  chesapeake  bay  and  went  diving  in  the  winter <period> and  became  a  tropical  ecologist  overnight <period> and  it  was  really  a  lot  of  fun  for  about  10  years <period> i  mean <comma> somebody  pays  you  to  go  around  and  travel  and  look  at  some  of  the  most  beautiful  places  on  the  planet <period> and  that  was  what  i  did <period> and  i  ended  up  in  jamaica <comma> in  the  west  indies <comma> where  the  coral  reefs  were  really  among  the  most  extraordinary <comma> structurally <comma> that  i  ever  saw  in  my  life <period> and  this  picture  here <comma> it  's  really  interesting <comma> it  shows  two  things: <period> first  of  all <comma> it  's  in  black  and  white  because  the  water  was  so  clear  and  you  could  see  so  far <comma> and  film  was  so  slow  in  the  1960s  and  early  70s <comma> you  took  pictures  in  black  and  white <period> the  other  thing  it  shows  you  is  that <comma> although  there  's  this  beautiful  forest  of  coral <comma> there  are  no  fish  in  that  picture <period> those  reefs  at  discovery  bay <comma> jamaica  were  the  most  studied  coral  reefs  in  the  world  for  20  years <period> we  were  the  best  and  the  brightest <period> people  came  to  study  our  reefs  from  australia <comma> which  is  sort  of  funny  because  now  we  go  to  theirs <period> and  the  view  of  scientists  about  how  coral  reefs  work <comma> how  they  ought  to  be <comma> was  based  on  these  reefs  without  any  fish <period> then <comma> in  1980 <comma> there  was  a  hurricane <comma> hurricane  allen <period> i  put  half  the  lab  up  in  my  house <period> the  wind  blew  very  strong <period> the  waves  were  25  to  50  feet  high <period> and  the  reefs  disappeared <comma> and  new  islands  formed <period> and  we  thought <comma> well <comma> we  're  real  smart <period> we  know  that  hurricanes  have  always  happened  in  the  past <period> and  we  published  a  paper  in  science <comma> the  first  time  that  anybody  ever  described  the  destruction  on  a  coral  reef  by  a  major  hurricane <period> and  we  predicted  what  would  happen <period> and  we  got  it  all  wrong <period> and  the  reason  was  because  of  overfishing <period> and  the  fact  that  a  last  common  grazer <comma> a  sea  urchin <comma> died <period> and  within  a  few  months  after  that  sea  urchin  dying <comma> the  seaweed  started  to  grow <period> and  that  is  the  same  reef <period> that  's  the  same  reef  15  years  ago <period> that  's  the  same  reef  today <period> the  coral  reefs  of  the  north  coast  of  jamaica  have  a  few  percent  live  coral  cover  and  a  lot  of  seaweed  and  slime <period> and  that  's  more  or  less  the  story  of  the  coral  reefs  of  the  caribbean <comma> and  increasingly <comma> tragically <comma> the  coral  reefs  worldwide <period> now <comma> that  's  my  little <comma> depressing  story <period> all  of  us  in  our  60s  and  70s  have  comparable  depressing  stories <period> there  are  tens  of  thousands  of  those  stories  out  there <period> and  it  's  really  hard  to  conjure  up  much  of  a  sense  of  well-being <comma> because  it  just  keeps  getting  worse <period> and  the  reason  it  keeps  getting  worse  is  that  after  a  natural  catastrophe <comma> like  a  hurricane <comma> some  kind  of  successional  sequence  of  recovery <comma> but  what  's  going  on  now  is  that  overfishing  and  pollution  and  climate  change  are  all  interacting  in  a  way  that  prevents  that <period> and  so  i  'm  going  to  sort  of  go  through  and  talk  about  those  three  kinds  of  things <period> we  hear  a  lot  about  the  collapse  of  cod <period> it  's  difficult  to  imagine  that  two <comma> or  some  historians  would  say  three  world  wars  were  fought  during  the  colonial  era  for  the  control  of  cod <period> cod  fed  most  of  the  people  of  western  europe <period> it  fed  the  slaves  brought  to  the  antilles <period> the  song  jamaica  farewell <comma> ackee  rice  salt  fish  are  nice <comma> is  an  emblem  of  the  importance  of  salt  cod  from  northeastern  canada <period> it  all  collapsed  in  the  80s  and  the  90s: <period> 35,000  people  lost  their  jobs <period> and  that  was  the  beginning  of  a  kind  of  serial  depletion <period> from  bigger  and  tastier  species  to  smaller  and  not-so-tasty  species <comma> from  species  that  were  near  to  home  to  species  that  were  all  around  the  world <period> and  what  have  you <period> it  's  a  little  hard  to  understand  that <comma> because  you  can  go  to  a  costco  in  the  united  states  and  buy  cheap  fish <period> you  ought  to  read  the  label  to  find  out  where  it  came  from <comma> but  it  's  still  cheap <comma> and  everybody  thinks  it  's  okay <period> it  's  hard  to  communicate  this <period> and  one  way  that  i  think  is  really  interesting  is  to  talk  about  sport  fish <comma> because  people  like  to  go  out  and  catch  fish <period> it  's  one  of  those  things <period> this  picture  here  shows  the  trophy  fish <comma> the  biggest  fish  caught  by  people  who  pay  a  lot  of  money  to  get  on  a  boat <comma> go  to  a  place  off  of  key  west  in  florida <comma> drink  a  lot  of  beer <comma> throw  a  lot  of  hooks  and  lines  into  the  water <comma> come  back  with  the  biggest  and  the  best  fish <comma> and  the  champion  trophy  fish  are  put  on  this  board <comma> where  people  take  a  picture <comma> and  this  guy  is  obviously  really  excited  about  that  fish <period> well <comma> that  's  what  it  's  like  now <comma> but  this  is  what  it  was  like  in  the  1950s  from  the  same  boat  in  the  same  place  on  the  same  board  on  the  same  dock <period> the  trophy  fish  were  so  big  that  you  could  n't  put  any  of  those  small  fish  up  on  it <period> and  the  average  size  trophy  fish  weighed  250  to  300  pounds <comma> goliath  grouper <comma> and  if  you  wanted  to  go  out  and  kill  something <comma> you  could  pretty  much  count  on  being  able  to  catch  one  of  those  fish <period> and  they  tasted  really  good <period> and  people  paid  less  in  1950  dollars  to  catch  that  than  what  people  pay  now  to  catch  those  little <comma> tiny  fish <period> and  that  's  everywhere <period> it  's  not  just  the  fish <comma> though <comma> that  are  disappearing <period> industrial  fishing  uses  big  stuff <comma> big  machinery <period> we  use  nets  that  are  20  miles  long <period> we  use  longlines  that  have  one  million  or  two  million  hooks <period> and  we  trawl <comma> which  means  to  take  something  the  size  of  a  tractor  trailer  truck  that  weighs  thousands  and  thousands  of  pounds <comma> put  it  on  a  big  chain <comma> and  drag  it  across  the  sea  floor  to  stir  up  the  bottom  and  catch  the  fish <period> think  of  it  as  being  kind  of  the  bulldozing  of  a  city  or  of  a  forest <comma> because  it  clears  it  away <period> and  the  habitat  destruction  is  unbelievable <period> this  is  a  photograph <comma> a  typical  photograph <comma> of  what  the  continental  shelves  of  the  world  look  like <period> you  can  see  the  rows  in  the  bottom <comma> the  way  you  can  see  the  rows  in  a  field  that  has  just  been  plowed  to  plant  corn <period> what  that  was <comma> was  a  forest  of  sponges  and  coral <comma> which  is  a  critical  habitat  for  the  development  of  fish <period> what  it  is  now  is  mud <period> and  the  area  of  the  ocean  floor  that  has  been  transformed  from  forest  to  level  mud <comma> to  parking  lot <comma> is  equivalent  to  the  entire  area  of  all  the  forests  that  have  ever  been  cut  down  on  all  of  the  earth  in  the  history  of  humanity <period> we've  managed  to  do  that  in  the  last  100  to  150  years <period> we  tend  to  think  of  oil  spills  and  mercury  and  we  hear  a  lot  about  plastic  these  days <period> and  all  of  that  stuff  is  really  disgusting <comma> but  what  's  really  insidious  is  the  biological  pollution  that  happens  because  of  the  magnitude  of  the  shifts  that  it  causes  to  entire  ecosystems <period> and  i  'm  going  to  just  talk  very  briefly  about  two  kinds  of  biological  pollution: <period> one  is  introduced  species  and  the  other  is  what  comes  from  nutrients <period> so  this  is  the  infamous  caulerpa  taxifolia <comma> the  so-called  killer  algae <period> a  book  was  written  about  it <period> it  's  a  bit  of  an  embarrassment <period> it  was  accidentally  released  from  the  aquarium  in  monaco <period> it  was  bred  to  be  cold  tolerant  to  have  in  peoples  aquaria <period> it  's  very  pretty <comma> and  it  has  rapidly  started  to  overgrow  the  once  very  rich  biodiversity  of  the  northwestern  mediterranean <period> i  do  n't  know  how  many  of  you  remember  the  movie  the  little  shop  of  horrors <comma> but  this  is  the  plant  of  the  little  shop  of  horrors <period> but <comma> instead  of  devouring  the  people  in  the  shop <comma> what  it  's  doing  is  overgrowing  and  smothering  virtually  all  of  the  bottom-dwelling  life  of  the  entire  northwestern  mediterranean  sea <period> we  do  n't  know  anything  that  eats  it <period> we  're  trying  to  do  all  sorts  of  genetics  and  figure  out  something  that  could  be  done <comma> but <comma> as  it  stands <comma> it  's  the  monster  from  hell <comma> about  which  nobody  knows  what  to  do <period> now  another  form  of  pollution  that  's  biological  pollution  is  what  happens  from  excess  nutrients <period> the  green  revolution <comma> all  of  this  artificial  nitrogen  fertilizer <comma> we  use  too  much  of  it <period> it  's  subsidized <comma> which  is  one  of  the  reasons  we  used  too  much  of  it <period> it  runs  down  the  rivers <comma> and  it  feeds  the  plankton <comma> the  little  microscopic  plant  cells  in  the  coastal  water <period> but  since  we  ate  all  the  oysters  and  we  ate  all  the  fish  that  would  eat  the  plankton <comma> there  's  nothing  to  eat  the  plankton <period> and  there  's  more  and  more  of  it <comma> so  it  dies  of  old  age <comma> which  is  unheard  of  for  plankton <period> and  when  it  dies <comma> it  falls  to  the  bottom  and  then  it  rots <comma> which  means  that  bacteria  break  it  down <period> and  in  the  process  they  use  up  all  the  oxygen <period> and  in  using  up  all  the  oxygen  they  make  the  environment  utterly  lethal  for  anything  that  cannot  swim  away <period> so <comma> what  we  end  up  with  is  a  microbial  zoo  dominated  by  bacteria  and  jellyfish <comma> as  you  see  on  the  left  in  front  of  you <period> and  the  only  fishery  left <comma> and  it  is  a  commercial  fishery <comma> is  the  jellyfish  fishery  you  see  on  the  right <comma> where  there  used  to  be  prawns <period> even  in  newfoundland  where  we  used  to  catch  cod <comma> we  now  have  a  jellyfish  fishery <period> and  another  version  of  this  sort  of  thing  is  what  is  often  called  red  tides  or  toxic  blooms <period> that  picture  on  the  left  is  just  staggering  to  me <period> i  have  talked  about  it  a  million  times <comma> but  it  's  unbelievable <period> in  the  upper  right  of  that  picture  on  the  left  is  almost  the  mississippi  delta <comma> and  the  lower  left  of  that  picture  is  the  texas-mexico  border <period> you  're  looking  at  the  entire  northwestern  gulf  of  mexico <period> you  're  looking  at  one  toxic  dinoflagellate  bloom  that  can  kill  fish <comma> made  by  that  beautiful  little  creature  on  the  lower  right <period> and  in  the  upper  right  you  see  this  black  sort  of  cloud  moving  ashore <period> that  's  the  same  species <period> and  as  it  comes  to  shore  and  the  wind  blows <comma> and  little  droplets  of  the  water  get  into  the  air <comma> the  emergency  rooms  of  all  the  hospitals  fill  up  with  people  with  acute  respiratory  distress <period> and  that  's  retirement  homes  on  the  west  coast  of  florida <period> a  friend  and  i  did  this  thing  in  hollywood  we  called  hollywood  ocean  night <period> and  i  was  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  explain  to  actors  what  's  going  on <period> and  i  said <comma> so <comma> imagine  you  're  in  a  movie  called  escape  from  malibu' <period> because  all  the  beautiful  people  have  moved  to  north  dakota <comma> where  it  's  clean  and  safe <period> and  the  only  people  who  are  left  there  are  the  people  who  cannot  afford  to  move  away  from  the  coast <comma> because  the  coast <comma> instead  of  being  paradise <comma> is  harmful  to  your  health <period> and  then  this  is  amazing <period> it  was  when  i  was  on  holiday  last  early  autumn  in  france <period> this  is  from  the  coast  of  brittany <comma> which  is  being  enveloped  in  this  green <comma> algal  slime <period> the  reason  that  it  attracted  so  much  attention <comma> besides  the  fact  that  it  's  disgusting <comma> is  that  sea  birds  flying  over  it  are  asphyxiated  by  the  smell  and  die <comma> and  a  farmer  died  of  it <comma> and  you  can  imagine  the  scandal  that  happened <period> and  so  there  's  this  war  between  the  farmers  and  the  fishermen  about  it  all <period> and  the  net  result  is  that  the  beaches  of  brittany  have  to  be  bulldozed  of  this  stuff  and  then <comma> of  course <comma> there  's  climate  change <comma> and  we  all  know  about  climate  change <period> i  guess  the  iconic  figure  of  it  is  the  melting  of  the  ice  in  the  arctic  sea <period> think  about  the  thousands  and  thousands  of  people  who  died  trying  to  find  the  northwest  passage <period> well <comma> the  northwest  passage  is  already  there <period> i  think  it  's  sort  of  funny <period> it  's  on  the  siberian  coast <period> maybe  the  russians  will  charge  tolls <period> the  governments  of  the  world  are  taking  this  really  seriously <period> the  military  of  the  arctic  nations  is  taking  it  really  seriously <period> for  all  the  denial  of  climate  change  by  government  leaders <comma> the  cia <period> and  the  navies  of  norway  and  the  us <period> and  canada <comma> whatever  are  busily  thinking  about  how  they  will  secure  their  territory  in  this  inevitability  from  their  point  of  view <period> and <comma> of  course <comma> arctic  communities  are  toast <period> the  other  kinds  of  effects  of  climate  change <comma> this  is  coral  bleaching <period> it  's  a  beautiful  picture <comma> right <questionmark> all  that  white  coral <period> except  it  's  supposed  to  be  brown <period> what  happens  is  that  the  corals  are  a  symbiosis <comma> and  they  have  these  little  algal  cells  that  live  inside  them <period> and  the  algae  give  the  corals  sugar <comma> and  the  corals  give  the  algae  nutrients  and  protection <period> but  when  it  gets  too  hot <comma> the  algae  cannot  make  the  sugar <period> the  corals  say <comma> you  cheated <period> you  did  n't  pay  your  rent <period> they  kick  them  out <comma> and  then  they  die <period> not  all  of  them  die <period> some  of  them  survive <period> some  more  are  surviving <comma> but  it  's  really  bad  news <period> to  try  and  give  you  a  sense  of  this <comma> imagine  you  go  camping  in  july  somewhere  in  europe  or  in  north  america <comma> and  you  wake  up  the  next  morning <comma> and  you  look  around  you <comma> and  you  see  that  80  percent  of  the  trees <comma> as  far  as  you  can  see <comma> have  dropped  their  leaves  and  are  standing  there  naked <period> and  you  come  home <comma> and  you  discover  that  80  percent  of  all  the  trees  in  north  america  and  in  europe  have  dropped  their  leaves <period> and  then  you  read  in  the  paper  a  few  weeks  later <comma> oh <comma> by  the  way <comma> a  quarter  of  those  died <period> well <comma> that  's  what  happened  in  the  indian  ocean  during  the  1998  el  nino <comma> an  area  vastly  greater  than  the  size  of  north  america  and  europe <comma> when  80  percent  of  all  the  corals  bleached  and  a  quarter  of  them  died <period> and  then  the  really  scary  thing  about  all  of  this <comma> the  overfishing <comma> the  pollution  and  the  climate  change <comma> is  that  each  thing  does  n't  happen  in  a  vacuum <period> but  there  are  these <comma> what  we  call <comma> positive  feedbacks <period> the  synergies  among  them  that  make  the  whole  vastly  greater  than  the  sum  of  the  parts <period> and  the  great  scientific  challenge  for  people  like  me  in  thinking  about  all  this <comma> is  do  we  know  how  to  put  humpty  dumpty  back  together  again <questionmark> i  mean <comma> because  we <comma> at  this  point <comma> we  can  protect  it <period> but  what  does  that  mean <questionmark> we  really  do  n't  know <period> so  what  are  the  oceans  going  to  be  like  in  20  or  50  years <questionmark> well <comma> there  wo  n't  be  any  fish  except  for  minnows <comma> and  the  water  will  be  pretty  dirty <comma> and  all  those  kinds  of  things  and  full  of  mercury <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> and  dead  zones  will  get  bigger  and  bigger  and  they  'll  start  to  merge <period> and  we  can  imagine  something  like  the  dead-zonification  of  the  global <comma> coastal  ocean <period> then  you  sure  wo  n't  want  to  eat  fish  that  were  raised  in  it <comma> because  it  would  be  a  kind  of  gastronomic  russian  roulette <period> sometimes  you  have  a  toxic  bloom <period> sometimes  you  do  n't <period> that  does  n't  sell <period> the  really  scary  things  though  are  the  physical <comma> chemical <comma> oceanographic  things  that  are  happening <period> as  the  surface  of  the  ocean  gets  warmer <comma> the  water  is  lighter  when  it  's  warmer <comma> it  becomes  harder  and  harder  to  turn  the  ocean  over <period> we  say  it  becomes  more  strongly  stratified <period> the  consequence  of  that  is  that  all  those  nutrients  that  fuel  the  great  anchoveta  fisheries <comma> of  the  sardines  of  california  or  in  peru  or  whatever <comma> those  slow  down  and  those  fisheries  collapse <period> and <comma> at  the  same  time <comma> water  from  the  surface <comma> which  is  rich  in  oxygen <comma> does  n't  make  it  down  and  the  ocean  turns  into  a  desert <period> so  the  question  is <comma> how  are  we  all  going  to  respond  to  this <questionmark> and  we  can  do  all  sorts  of  things  to  fix  it <comma> but  in  the  final  analysis <comma> the  thing  we  really  need  to  fix  is  ourselves <period> it  's  not  about  the  fish <period> it  's  not  about  the  pollution <period> it  's  not  about  the  climate  change <period> it  's  about  us  and  our  greed  and  our  need  for  growth  and  our  inability  to  imagine  a  world  that  is  different  from  the  selfish  world  we  live  in  today <period> so  the  question  is <comma> will  we  respond  to  this  or  not <questionmark> i  would  say  that  the  future  of  life  and  the  dignity  of  human  beings  depends  on  our  doing  that <period> thank  you <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  your  mindset <period> does  your  mindset  correspond  to  my  dataset <questionmark> if  not <comma> one  or  the  other  needs  upgrading <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> when  i  talk  to  my  students  about  global  issues <comma> and  i  listen  to  them  in  the  coffee  break <comma> they  always  talk  about  we  and  them <period> and  when  they  come  back  into  the  lecture  room  i  ask  them <comma> what  do  you  mean  with  we  and  them <questionmark> oh <comma> it  's  very  easy <period> it  's  the  western  world  and  it  's  the  developing  world <comma> they  say <period> we  learned  it  in  college  and  what  is  the  definition  then <questionmark> the  definition <questionmark> everyone  knows <comma> they  say <period> but  then  you  know <comma> i  press  them  like  this <period> so  one  girl  said <comma> very  cleverly <comma> it  's  very  easy <period> western  world  is  a  long  life  in  a  small  family <period> developing  world  is  a  short  life  in  a  large  family  and  i  like  that  definition <comma> because  it  enabled  me  to  transfer  their  mindset  into  the  dataset <period> and  here  you  have  the  dataset <period> so <comma> you  can  see  that  what  we  have  on  this  axis  here  is  size  of  family <period> one <comma> two <comma> three <comma> four <comma> five  children  per  woman  on  this  axis <period> and  here <comma> length  of  life <comma> life  expectancy <comma> 30 <comma> 40 <comma> 50 <period> exactly  what  the  students  said  was  their  concept  about  the  world <period> and  really  this  is  about  the  bedroom <period> whether  the  man  and  woman  decide  to  have  small  family <comma> and  take  care  of  their  kids <comma> and  how  long  they  will  live <period> it  's  about  the  bathroom  and  the  kitchen <period> if  you  have  soap <comma> water  and  food <comma> you  know <comma> you  can  live  long <period> and  the  students  were  right <period> it  was  n't  that  the  world  consisted <comma> the  world  consisted  here <comma> of  one  set  of  countries  over  here <comma> which  had  large  families  and  short  life <period> developing  world <period> and  we  had  one  set  of  countries  up  there  which  was  the  western  world <period> they  had  small  families  and  long  life <period> and  you  are  going  to  see  here  the  amazing  thing  that  has  happened  in  the  world  during  my  lifetime <period> then  the  developing  countries  applied  soap  and  water <comma> vaccination <period> and  all  the  developing  world  started  to  apply  family  planning <period> and  partly  to  usa  who  help  to  provide  technical  advice  and  investment <period> and  you  see  all  the  world  moves  over  to  a  two  child  family <comma> and  a  life  with  60  to  70  years <period> but  some  countries  remain  back  in  this  area  here <period> and  you  can  see  we  still  have  afghanistan  down  here <period> we  have  liberia <period> we  have  congo <period> so  we  have  countries  living  there <period> so  the  problem  i  had  is  that  the  worldview  that  my  students  had  corresponds  to  reality  in  the  world  the  year  their  teachers  were  born <period> and  we <comma> in  fact <comma> when  we  have  played  this  over  the  world <period> i  was  at  the  global  health  conference  here  in  washington  last  week <comma> and  i  could  see  the  wrong  concept  even  active  people  in  united  states  had <period> that  they  did  n't  realize  the  improvement  of  mexico  there <comma> and  china <comma> in  relation  to  united  states <period> look  here  when  i  move  them  forward <period> here  we  go <period> they  catch  up <period> there  's  mexico <period> it  's  on  par  with  united  states  in  these  two  social  dimensions <period> there  was  less  than  five  percent  of  the  specialists  in  global  health  that  was  aware  of  this <period> this  great  nation <comma> mexico <comma> has  the  problem  that  arms  are  coming  from  north <comma> across  the  borders <comma> so  they  had  to  stop  that <period> because  they  have  this  strange  relationship  to  the  united  states <comma> you  know <period> but  if  i  would  change  this  axis  here <comma> i  would  instead  put  income  per  person <period> income  per  person <period> i  can  put  that  here <period> and  we  will  then  see  a  completely  different  picture <period> by  the  way <comma> i  'm  teaching  you  how  to  use  our  website <comma> gapminder  world <comma> while  i  'm  correcting  this <comma> because  this  is  a  free  utility  on  the  net <period> and  when  i  now  finally  got  it  right <comma> i  can  go  back  200  years  in  history <period> and  i  can  find  united  states  up  there <period> and  i  can  let  the  other  countries  be  shown <period> and  now  i  have  income  per  person  on  this  axis <period> and  united  states  only  had  some <comma> one <comma> two  thousand  dollars  at  that  time <period> and  the  life  expectancy  was  35  to  40  years <comma> on  par  with  afghanistan  today <period> and  what  has  happened  in  the  world <comma> i  will  show  now <period> this  is  instead  of  studying  history  for  one  year  at  university <period> you  can  watch  me  for  one  minute  now  and  you  'll  see  the  whole  thing <period> you  can  see  how  the  brown  bubbles <comma> which  is  west  europe <comma> and  the  yellow  one <comma> which  is  the  united  states <comma> they  get  richer  and  richer  and  also  start  to  get  healthier  and  healthier <period> and  this  is  now  100  years  ago <comma> where  the  rest  of  the  world  remains  behind <period> here  we  come <period> and  that  was  the  influenza <period> that  's  why  we  are  so  scared  about  flu <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> it  's  still  remembered <period> the  fall  of  life  expectancy <period> and  then  we  come  up <period> not  until  independence  started <period> look  here  you  have  china  over  there <comma> you  have  india  over  there <comma> and  this  is  what  has  happened <period> did  you  note  there <comma> that  we  have  mexico  up  there <questionmark> mexico  is  not  at  all  on  par  with  the  united  states <period> but  they  are  quite  close <period> and  especially <comma> it  's  interesting  to  see  china  and  the  united  states  during  200  years <period> because  i  have  my  oldest  son  now  working  for  google <comma> after  google  acquired  this  software <period> because  in  fact <comma> this  is  child  labor <period> my  son  and  his  wife  sat  in  a  closet  for  many  years  and  developed  this <period> and  my  youngest  son <comma> who  studied  chinese  in  beijing <period> so  they  come  in  with  the  two  perspectives  i  have <comma> you  know <questionmark> and  my  son <comma> youngest  son  who  studied  in  beijing <comma> in  china <comma> he  got  a  long-term  perspective <period> whereas  when  my  oldest  son <comma> who  works  for  google <comma> he  should  develop  by  quarter <comma> or  by  half-year <period> or  google  is  quite  generous <comma> so  he  can  have  one  or  two  years  to  go <period> but  in  china  they  look  generation  after  generation  because  they  remember  the  very  embarrassing  period <comma> for  100  years <comma> when  they  went  backwards <period> and  then  they  would  remember  the  first  part  of  last  century <comma> which  was  really  bad <period> and  we  could  go  by  this  so-called  great  leap  forward <period> but  this  was  1963 <period> mao  tse-tung  eventually  brought  health  to  china <period> and  then  he  died <comma> and  then  deng  xiaoping  started  this  amazing  move  forward <period> is  n't  it  strange  to  see  that  the  united  states  first  grew  the  economy <comma> and  then  gradually  got  rich <questionmark> whereas  china  could  get  healthy  much  earlier <period> because  they  applied  the  knowledge  of  education <comma> nutrition <comma> and  then  also  benefits  of  penicillin  and  vaccines  and  family  planning <period> and  asia  could  have  social  development  before  they  got  the  economic  development <period> so  to  me <comma> as  a  public  health  professor <comma> it  's  not  strange  that  all  these  countries  grow  so  fast  now <period> because  what  you  see  here <comma> what  you  see  here  is  the  flat  world  of  thomas  friedman <period> is  n't  it <period> it  's  not  really <comma> really  flat <period> but  the  middle  income  countries <comma> and  this  is  where  i  suggest  to  my  students <comma> stop  using  the  concept  developing  world  because  after  all <comma> talking  about  the  developing  world  is  like  having  two  chapters  in  the  history  of  the  united  states <period> the  last  chapter  is  about  present <comma> and  president  obama <period> and  the  other  is  about  the  past <comma> where  you  cover  everything  from  washington  to  eisenhower <period> because  washington  to  eisenhower <comma> that  is  what  we  find  in  the  developing  world <period> we  could  actually  go  to  mayflower  to  eisenhower <comma> and  that  would  be  put  together  into  a  developing  world <period> which  is  rightly  growing  its  cities  in  a  very  amazing  way <period> which  have  great  entrepreneurs <comma> but  also  have  the  collapsing  countries <period> so <comma> how  could  we  make  better  sense  about  this <questionmark> well <comma> one  way  of  trying  is  to  see  whether  we  could  look  at  income  distribution <period> this  is  the  income  distribution  of  peoples  in  the  world <comma> from  $1 <period> this  is  where  you  have  food  to  eat <period> these  people  go  to  bed  hungry <period> and  this  is  the  number  of  people <period> this  is  $10 <comma> whether  you  have  a  public  or  a  private  health  service  system <period> this  is  where  you  can  provide  health  service  for  your  family  and  school  for  your  children <period> and  this  is  oecd  countries: <period> green <comma> latin  america <comma> east  europe <period> this  is  east  asia <comma> and  the  light  blue  there  is  south  asia <period> and  this  is  how  the  world  changed <period> it  changed  like  this <period> can  you  see  how  it  's  growing <questionmark> and  how  hundreds  of  millions  and  billions  is  coming  out  of  poverty  in  asia <questionmark> and  it  goes  over  here <questionmark> and  i  come  now <comma> into  projections <period> but  i  have  to  stop  at  the  door  of  lehman  brothers  there <comma> you  know <comma> because <comma> that  's  where  the  projections  are  not  valid  any  longer <period> probably  the  world  will  do  this <period> and  then  it  will  continue  forward  like  this <period> but  more  or  less <comma> this  is  what  will  happen <period> and  we  have  a  world  which  cannot  be  looked  upon  as  divided <period> we  have  the  high  income  countries  here <comma> with  the  united  states  as  a  leading  power <period> we  have  the  emerging  economies  in  the  middle <comma> which  provide  a  lot  of  the  funding  for  the  bailout <period> and  we  have  the  low  income  countries  here <period> yeah <comma> this  is  a  fact  that  from  where  the  money  comes <period> they  have  been  saving <comma> you  know <comma> over  the  last  decade <period> and  here  we  have  the  low  income  countries  where  entrepreneurs  are <period> and  here  we  have  the  countries  in  collapse  and  war <comma> like  afghanistan <comma> somalia <comma> parts  of  congo <comma> darfur <period> we  have  all  this  at  the  same  time <period> that  's  why  it  's  so  problematic  to  describe  what  has  happened  in  the  developing  world <period> because  it  's  so  different <comma> what  has  happened  there <period> and  that  's  why  i  suggest  a  slightly  different  approach  of  what  you  would  call  it <period> and  you  have  huge  differences  within  countries  also <period> i  heard  that  your  departments  here  were  by  regions <period> here  you  have  sub-saharan  africa <comma> south  asia <comma> east  asia <comma> arab  states <comma> east  europe <comma> latin  america <comma> and  oecd <period> and  on  this  axis <comma> gdp <period> and  on  this <comma> heath <comma> child  survival <period> and  it  does  n't  come  as  a  surprise  that  africa  south  of  sahara  is  at  the  bottom <period> but  when  i  split  it <comma> when  i  split  it  into  country  bubbles <comma> the  size  of  the  bubbles  here  is  the  population <period> then  you  see  sierra  leone  and  mauritius <comma> completely  different <period> there  is  such  a  difference  within  sub-saharan  africa <period> and  i  can  split  the  others <period> here  is  the  south  asian <comma> arab  world <period> now  all  your  different  departments <period> east  europe <comma> latin  america <comma> and  oecd  countries <period> and  here  were  are <period> we  have  a  continuum  in  the  world <period> we  cannot  put  it  into  two  parts <period> it  is  mayflower  down  here <period> it  is  washington  here <comma> building <comma> building  countries <period> it  's  lincoln  here <comma> advancing  them <period> it  's  eisenhower  bringing  modernity  into  the  countries <period> and  then  it  's  united  states  today <comma> up  here <period> and  we  have  countries  all  this  way <period> now <comma> this  is  the  important  thing  of  understanding  how  the  world  has  changed <period> at  this  point  i  decided  to  make  a  pause <period> and  it  is  my  task <comma> on  behalf  of  the  rest  of  the  world <comma> to  convey  a  thanks  to  the  us <period> taxpayers <comma> for  demographic  health  survey <period> many  are  not  aware  of <comma> no <comma> this  is  not  a  joke <period> this  is  very  serious <period> it  is  due  to  usa  's  continuous  sponsoring  during  25  years  of  the  very  good  methodology  for  measuring  child  mortality  that  we  have  a  grasp  of  what  's  happening  in  the  world <period> and  it  is  us <period> government  at  its  best <comma> without  advocacy <comma> providing  facts <comma> that  it  's  useful  for  the  society <period> and  providing  data  free  of  charge  on  the  internet <comma> for  the  world  to  use <period> thank  you  very  much <period> quite  the  opposite  of  the  world  bank <comma> who  compiled  data  with  government  money <comma> tax  money <comma> and  then  they  sell  it  to  add  a  little  profit <comma> in  a  very  inefficient <comma> gutenberg  way <period> but  the  people  doing  that  at  the  world  bank  are  among  the  best  in  the  world <period> and  they  are  highly  skilled  professionals <period> it  's  just  that  we  would  like  to  upgrade  our  international  agencies  to  deal  with  the  world  in  the  modern  way <comma> as  we  do <period> and  when  it  comes  to  free  data  and  transparency <comma> united  states  of  america  is  one  of  the  best <period> and  that  does  n't  come  easy  from  the  mouth  of  a  swedish  public  health  professor <period> and  i  'm  not  paid  to  come  here <comma> no <period> i  would  like  to  show  you  what  happens  with  the  data <comma> what  we  can  show  with  this  data <period> look  here <period> this  is  the  world <period> with  income  down  there  and  child  mortality <period> and  what  has  happened  in  the  world <questionmark> since  1950 <comma> during  the  last  50  years  we  have  had  a  fall  in  child  mortality <period> and  it  is  the  dhs  that  makes  it  possible  to  know  this <period> and  we  had  an  increase  in  income <period> and  the  blue  former  developing  countries  are  mixing  up  with  the  former  industrialized  western  world <period> we  have  a  continuum <period> but  we  still  have <comma> of  course <comma> congo <comma> up  there <period> we  still  have  as  poor  countries  as  we  have  had <comma> always <comma> in  history <period> and  that  's  the  bottom  billion <comma> where  we've  heard  today  about  a  completely  new  approach  to  do  it <period> and  how  fast  has  this  happened <questionmark> well <comma> mdg  4 <period> the  united  states  has  not  been  so  eager  to  use  mdg  4 <period> but  you  have  been  the  main  sponsor  that  has  enabled  us  to  measure  it <period> because  it  's  the  only  child  mortality  that  we  can  measure <period> and  we  used  to  say  that  it  should  fall  four  percent  per  year <period> let  's  see  what  sweden  has  done <period> we  used  to  boast  about  fast  social  progress <period> that  's  where  we  were <comma> 1900 <period> 1900 <comma> sweden  was  there <period> same  child  mortality  as  bangladesh  had <comma> 1990 <period> though  they  had  lower  income <period> they  started  very  well <period> they  used  the  aid  well <period> they  vaccinated  the  kids <period> they  get  better  water <period> and  they  reduced  child  mortality <comma> with  an  amazing  47  percent  per  year <period> they  beat  sweden <period> i  run  sweden  the  same  16  year  period <period> second  round <comma> it  's  sweden <comma> 1916 <comma> against  egypt <comma> 1990 <period> here  we  go <period> once  again  the  usa  is  part  of  the  reason  here <period> they  get  safe  water <comma> they  get  food  for  the  poor <period> and  they  get  malaria  eradicated <period> 55  percent <period> they  are  faster  than  the  millennium  development  goal <period> and  third  chance  for  sweden <comma> against  brazil  here <period> brazil  here  has  amazing  social  improvement  over  the  last  16  years <period> and  they  go  faster  than  sweden <period> this  means  that  the  world  is  converging <period> the  middle  income  countries <comma> the  emerging  economy <comma> they  are  catching  up <period> they  are  moving  to  cities <comma> where  they  also  get  better  assistance  for  that <period> well  the  swedish  students  protest  at  this  point <period> they  say <comma> this  is  not  fair <comma> because  these  countries  had  vaccines  and  antibiotics  that  were  not  available  for  sweden <period> we  have  to  do  real-time  competition <period> okay <period> i  give  you  singapore <comma> the  year  i  was  born <period> singapore  had  twice  the  child  mortality  of  sweden <period> it  's  the  most  tropical  country  in  the  world <period> a  marshland  on  the  equator <period> and  here  we  go <period> it  took  a  little  time  for  them  to  get  independent <period> but  then  they  started  to  grow  their  economy <period> and  they  made  the  social  investment <period> they  got  away  malaria <period> they  got  a  magnificent  health  system  that  beat  both  the  us <period> and  sweden <period> we  never  thought  it  would  happen  that  they  would  win  over  sweden <period> all  these  green  countries  are  achieving  millennium  development  goals <period> these  yellow  are  just  about  to  be  doing  this <period> these  red  are  the  countries  that  does  n't  do  it <comma> and  the  policy  has  to  be  improved <period> not  simplistic  extrapolation <period> we  have  to  really  find  a  way  of  supporting  those  countries  in  a  better  way <period> we  have  to  respect  the  middle  income  countries  on  what  they  are  doing <period> and  we  have  to  fact-base  the  whole  way  we  look  at  the  world <period> this  is  dollar  per  person <period> this  is  hiv  in  the  countries <period> the  blue  is  africa <period> the  size  of  the  bubbles  is  how  many  are  hiv  affected <period> you  see  the  tragedy  in  south  africa  there <period> about  20  percent  of  the  adult  population  are  infected <period> and  in  spite  of  them  having  quite  a  high  income <comma> they  have  a  huge  number  of  hiv  infected <period> but  you  also  see  that  there  are  african  countries  down  here <period> there  is  no  such  thing  as  an  hiv  epidemic  in  africa <period> there  's  a  number <comma> five  to  10  countries  in  africa  that  has  the  same  level  as  sweden  and  united  states <period> and  there  are  others  who  are  extremely  high <period> and  i  will  show  you  that  what  has  happened  in  one  of  the  best  countries <comma> with  the  most  vibrant  economy  in  africa  and  a  good  governance <comma> botswana <period> they  have  a  very  high  level <period> it  's  coming  down <period> but  now  it  's  not  falling <period> because  there <comma> with  help  from  pepfar <comma> it  's  working  with  treatment <period> and  people  are  not  dying <period> and  you  can  see  it  's  not  that  easy <comma> that  it  is  war  which  caused  this <period> because  here <comma> in  congo <comma> there  is  war <period> and  here <comma> in  zambia <comma> there  is  peace <period> and  it  's  not  the  economy <period> richer  country  has  a  little  higher <period> if  i  split  tanzania  in  its  income <period> the  richer  20  percent  in  tanzania  has  more  hiv  than  the  poorest  one <period> and  it  's  really  different  within  each  country <period> look  at  the  provinces  of  kenya <period> they  are  very  different <period> and  this  is  the  situation  you  see <period> it  's  not  deep  poverty <period> it  's  the  special  situation <period> probably  of  concurrent  sexual  partnership  among  part  of  the  heterosexual  population  in  some  countries <comma> or  some  parts  of  countries <comma> in  south  and  eastern  africa <period> do  n't  make  it  africa <period> do  n't  make  it  a  race  issue <period> make  it  a  local  issue <period> and  do  prevention  at  each  place <comma> in  the  way  it  can  be  done  there <period> there  are  things  of  suffering  in  the  one  billion  poorest <comma> which  we  do  n't  know <period> those  who  live  beyond  the  cellphone <comma> those  who  have  yet  to  see  a  computer <comma> those  who  have  no  electricity  at  home <period> this  is  the  disease <comma> konzo <comma> i  spent  20  years  elucidating  in  africa <period> it  's  caused  by  fast  processing  of  toxic  cassava  root  in  famine  situation <period> it  's  similar  to  the  pellagra  epidemic  in  mississippi  in  the  30s <period> it  's  similar  to  other  nutritional  diseases <period> it  will  never  affect  a  rich  person <period> we  have  seen  it  here  in  mozambique <period> this  is  the  epidemic  in  mozambique <period> this  is  an  epidemic  in  northern  tanzania <period> you  never  heard  about  the  disease <period> but  it  's  much  more  than  ebola  that  has  been  affected  by  this  disease <period> cause  crippling  throughout  the  world <period> and  over  the  last  two  years <comma> 2,000  people  has  been  crippled  in  the  southern  tip  of  bandundu  region <period> that  used  to  be  the  illegal  diamond  trade <comma> from  the  unita-dominated  area  in  angola <period> that  has  now  disappeared <period> and  they  are  now  in  great  economic  problem <period> and  one  week  ago <comma> for  the  first  time <comma> there  were  four  lines  on  the  internet <period> do  n't  get  confused  of  the  progress  of  the  emerging  economies  and  the  great  capacity  of  people  in  the  middle  income  countries  and  in  peaceful  low  income  countries <period> there  is  still  mystery  in  one  billion <period> and  we  have  to  have  more  concepts  than  just  developing  countries  and  developing  world <period> we  need  a  new  mindset <period> the  world  is  converging <period> but <comma> but <comma> but  not  the  bottom  billion <period> they  are  still  as  poor  as  they've  ever  been <period> it  's  not  sustainable <comma> and  it  will  not  happen  around  one  superpower <period> but  you  will  remain  one  of  the  most  important  superpowers <period> and  the  most  hopeful  superpower <comma> for  the  time  to  be <period> and  this  institution  will  have  a  very  crucial  role <comma> not  for  united  states <comma> but  for  the  world <period> so  you  have  a  very  bad  name <comma> state  department <period> this  is  not  the  state  department <period> it  's  the  world  department <period> and  we  have  a  high  hope  in  you <period> thank  you  very  much <period> first  place  i'd  like  to  take  you  is  what  many  believe  will  be  the  world  's  deepest  natural  abyss <period> and  i  say  believe  because  this  process  is  still  ongoing <period> right  now  there  are  major  expeditions  being  planned  for  next  year  that  i  'll  talk  a  little  bit  about <period> one  of  the  things  that  's  changed  here <comma> in  the  last  150  years  since  jules  verne  had  great  science-fiction  concepts  of  what  the  underworld  was  like <comma> is  that  technology  has  enabled  us  to  go  to  these  places  that  were  previously  completely  unknown  and  speculated  about <period> we  can  now  descend  thousands  of  meters  into  the  earth  with  relative  impunity <period> along  the  way  we've  discovered  fantastic  abysses  and  chambers  so  large  that  you  can  see  for  hundreds  of  meters  without  a  break  in  the  line  of  sight <period> when  you  go  on  a  thing  like  this <comma> we  can  usually  be  in  the  field  for  anywhere  from  two  to  four  months <comma> with  a  team  as  small  as  20  or  30 <comma> to  as  big  as  150 <period> and  a  lot  of  people  ask  me <comma> you  know <comma> what  kind  of  people  do  you  get  for  a  project  like  this <questionmark> while  our  selection  process  is  not  as  rigorous  as  nasa <comma> it  's  nonetheless  thorough <period> we  're  looking  for  competence <comma> discipline <comma> endurance <comma> and  strength <period> in  case  you  're  wondering <comma> this  is  our  strength  test <period> but  we  also  value  esprit  de  corps  and  the  ability  to  diplomatically  resolve  inter-personal  conflict  while  under  great  stress  in  remote  locations <period> we  have  already  gone  far  beyond  the  limits  of  human  endurance <period> from  the  entrance <comma> this  is  nothing  like  a  commercial  cave <period> you  're  looking  at  camp  two  in  a  place  called  j2 <comma> not  k2 <comma> but  j2 <period> we  're  roughly  two  days  from  the  entrance  at  that  point <period> and  it  's  kind  of  like  a  high  altitude  mountaineering  trip  in  reverse <comma> except  that  you  're  now  running  a  string  of  these  things  down <period> the  idea  is  to  try  to  provide  some  measure  of  physical  comfort  while  you  're  down  there <comma> otherwise  in  damp <comma> moist <comma> cold  conditions  in  utterly  dark  places <period> i  should  mention  that  everything  you  're  seeing  here <comma> by  the  way <comma> is  artificially  illuminated  at  great  effort <period> otherwise  it  is  completely  dark  in  these  places <period> the  deeper  you  go <comma> the  more  you  run  into  a  conflict  with  water <period> it  's  basically  like  a  tree  collecting  water  coming  down <period> and  eventually  you  get  to  places  where  it  is  formidable  and  dangerous  and  unfortunately  slides  just  do  n't  do  justice <period> so  i've  got  a  very  brief  clip  here  that  was  taken  in  the  late  1980s <period> so  descend  into  huautla  plateau  in  mexico <period> now  i  have  to  tell  you  that  the  techniques  being  shown  here  are  obsolete  and  dangerous <period> we  would  not  do  this  today  unless  we  were  doing  it  for  film <period> along  that  same  line <comma> i  have  to  tell  you  that  with  the  spate  of  hollywood  movies  that  came  out  last  year <comma> we  have  never  seen  monsters  underground <comma> at  least  the  kind  that  eat  you <period> if  there  is  a  monster  underground <comma> it  is  the  crushing  psychological  remoteness  that  begins  to  hit  every  member  of  the  team  once  you  cross  about  three  days  inbound  from  the  nearest  entrance <period> next  year  i  'll  be  leading  an  international  team  to  j2 <period> we  're  going  to  be  shooting  from  minus  2,600  meters <comma> that  's  a  little  over  8,600  feet  down <comma> at  30  kilometers  from  the  entrance <period> the  lead  crews  will  be  underground  for  pushing  30  days  straight <period> i  do  n't  think  there  's  been  a  mission  like  that  in  a  long  time <period> eventually <comma> if  you  keep  going  down  in  these  things <comma> probability  says  that  you  're  going  to  run  into  a  place  like  this <period> it  's  a  place  where  there  's  a  fold  in  the  geologic  stratum  that  collects  water  and  fills  to  the  roof <period> and  when  you  used  to  find  these  things <comma> they  would  put  a  label  on  a  map  that  said  terminal  siphon <period> now  i  remember  that  term  really  well  for  two  reasons <period> number  one <comma> it  's  the  name  of  my  rock  band <comma> and  second <comma> is  because  the  confrontation  of  these  things  forced  me  to  become  an  inventor <period> and  we've  since  gone  on  to  develop  many  generations  of  gadgets  for  exploring  places  like  this <period> this  is  some  life-support  equipment  closed-cycle <period> and  you  can  use  that  now  to  go  for  many  kilometers  horizontally  underwater  and  to  depths  of  200  meters  straight  down  underwater <period> when  you  do  this  kind  of  stuff  it  's  like  doing  eva <period> it  's  like  doing  extra-vehicular  activity  in  space <comma> but  at  much  greater  distances <comma> and  at  much  greater  physical  peril <period> so  it  makes  you  think  about  how  to  design  your  equipment  for  long  range <comma> away  from  a  safe  haven <period> here  's  a  clip  from  a  national  geographic  movie  that  came  out  in  1999 <period> narrator <comma> exploration  is  a  physical  process  of  putting  your  foot  in  places  where  humans  have  never  stepped  before <period> this  is  where  the  last  little  nugget  of  totally  unknown  territory  remains  on  this  planet <period> to  experience  it  is  a  privilege <period> bill  stone <comma> that  was  taken  in  wakulla  springs <comma> florida <period> couple  of  things  to  note  about  that  movie <period> every  piece  of  equipment  that  you  saw  in  there  did  not  exist  before  1999 <period> it  was  developed  within  a  two-year  period  and  used  on  actual  exploratory  projects <period> this  gadget  you  see  right  here  was  called  the  digital  wall  mapper <comma> and  it  produced  the  first  three-dimensional  map  anybody  has  ever  done  of  a  cave <comma> and  it  happened  to  be  underwater  in  wakulla  springs <period> it  was  that  gadget  that  serendipitously  opened  a  door  to  another  unexplored  world <period> this  is  europa <period> carolyn  porco  mentioned  another  one  called  enceladus  the  other  day <period> this  is  one  of  the  places  where  planetary  scientists  believe  there  is  a  highest  probability  of  the  detection  of  the  first  life  off  earth  in  the  ocean  that  exists  below  there <period> for  those  who  have  never  seen  this  story <comma> jim  cameron  produced  a  really  wonderful  imax  movie  couple  of  years  ago <comma> called  aliens  of  the  deep  there  was  a  brief  clip <comma> narrator <comma> a  mission  to  explore  under  the  ice  of  europa  would  be  the  ultimate  robotic  challenge <period> europa  is  so  far  away  that  even  at  the  speed  of  light <comma> it  would  take  more  than  an  hour  for  the  command  just  to  reach  the  vehicle <period> it  has  to  be  smart  enough  to  avoid  terrain  hazards  and  to  find  a  good  landing  site  on  the  ice <period> now  we  have  to  get  through  the  ice <period> you  need  a  melt  probe <period> it  's  basically  a  nuclear-heated  torpedo <period> the  ice  could  be  anywhere  from  three  to  16  miles  deep <period> week  after  week <comma> the  melt  probe  will  sink  of  its  own  weight  through  the  ancient  ice <comma> until  finally  -- <period> now <comma> what  are  you  going  to  do  when  you  reach  the  surface  of  that  ocean <questionmark> you  need  an  auv <comma> an  autonomous  underwater  vehicle <period> it  needs  to  be  one  smart  puppy <comma> able  to  navigate  and  make  decisions  on  its  own  in  an  alien  ocean <period> bs <comma> what  jim  did  n't  know  when  he  released  that  movie  was  that  six  months  earlier  nasa  had  funded  a  team  i  assembled  to  develop  a  prototype  for  the  europa  auv <period> i  mean <comma> i  cut  through  three  years  of  engineering  meetings <comma> design  and  system  integration <comma> and  introduced  depthx <comma> deep  phreatic  thermal  explorer <period> and  as  the  movie  says <comma> this  is  one  smart  puppy <period> it  's  got  96  sensors <comma> 36  onboard  computers <comma> 100,000  lines  of  behavioral  autonomy  code <comma> packs  more  than  10  kilos  of  tnt  in  electrical  onboard  equivalent <period> this  is  the  target  site <comma> the  world  's  deepest  hydrothermal  spring  at  cenote  zacaton  in  northern  mexico <period> it  's  been  explored  to  a  depth  of  292  meters  and  beyond  that  nobody  knows  anything <period> this  is  part  of  depthx  's  mission <period> there  are  two  primary  targets  we  're  doing  here <period> one  is <comma> how  do  you  do  science  autonomy  underground <questionmark> how  do  you  take  a  robot  and  turn  it  into  a  field  microbiologist <questionmark> there  are  more  stages  involved  here  than  i've  got  time  to  tell  you  about <comma> but  basically  we  drive  through  the  space <comma> we  populate  it  with  environmental  variables <comma> sulphide <comma> halide <comma> things  like  that <period> we  calculate  gradient  surfaces <comma> and  drive  the  bot  over  to  a  wall  where  there  's  a  high  probability  of  life <period> we  move  along  the  wall <comma> in  what  's  called  proximity  operations <comma> looking  for  changes  in  color <period> if  we  see  something  that  looks  interesting <comma> we  pull  it  into  a  microscope <period> if  it  passes  the  microscopic  test <comma> we  go  for  a  collection <period> we  either  draw  in  a  liquid  sample <comma> or  we  can  actually  take  a  solid  core  from  the  wall <period> no  hands  at  the  wheel <period> this  is  all  behavioral  autonomy  here  that  's  being  conducted  by  the  robot  on  its  own <period> the  real  hat  trick  for  this  vehicle <comma> though <comma> is  a  disruptive  new  navigation  system  we've  developed <comma> known  as  3d  slam <comma> for  simultaneous  localization  and  mapping <period> depthx  is  an  all-seeing  eyeball <period> its  sensor  beams  look  both  forward  and  backward  at  the  same  time <comma> allowing  it  to  do  new  exploration  while  it  's  still  achieving  geometric  sensor-lock  on  what  it  's  gone  through  already <period> what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  next  is  the  first  fully  autonomous  robotic  exploration  underground  that  's  ever  been  done <period> this  may <comma> we  're  going  to  go  from  minus  1,000  meters  in  zacaton <comma> and  if  we  're  very  lucky <comma> depthx  will  bring  back  the  first  robotically-discovered  division  of  bacteria <period> the  next  step  after  that  is  to  test  it  in  antartica  and  then <comma> if  the  funding  continues  and  nasa  has  the  resolution  to  go <comma> we  could  potentially  launch  by  2016 <comma> and  by  2019  we  may  have  the  first  evidence  of  life  off  this  planet <period> what  then  of  manned  space  exploration <questionmark> the  government  recently  announced  plans  to  return  to  the  moon  by  2024 <period> the  successful  conclusion  of  that  mission  will  result  in  infrequent  visitation  of  the  moon  by  a  small  number  of  government  scientists  and  pilots <period> it  will  leave  us  no  further  along  in  the  general  expansion  of  humanity  into  space  than  we  were  50  years  ago <period> something  fundamental  has  to  change  if  we  are  to  see  common  access  to  space  in  our  lifetime <period> what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  next  are  a  couple  of  controversial  ideas <period> and  i  hope  you  'll  bear  with  me  and  have  some  faith  that  there  's  credibility  behind  what  we  're  going  to  say  here <period> there  are  three  underpinnings  of  working  in  space  privately <period> one  of  them  is  the  requirement  for  economical  earth-to-space  transport <period> the  bert  rutans  and  richard  bransons  of  this  world  have  got  this  in  their  sights  and  i  salute  them <period> go <comma> go <comma> go <period> the  next  thing  we  need  are  places  to  stay  on  orbit <period> orbital  hotels  to  start  with <comma> but  workshops  for  the  rest  of  us  later  on <period> the  final  missing  piece <comma> the  real  paradigm-buster <comma> is  this <comma> a  gas  station  on  orbit <period> it  's  not  going  to  look  like  that <period> if  it  existed <comma> it  would  change  all  future  spacecraft  design  and  space  mission  planning <period> now <comma> to  give  you  a  chance  to  understand  why  there  is  power  in  that  statement <comma> i've  got  to  give  you  the  basics  of  space  101 <period> and  the  first  thing  is  everything  you  do  in  space  you  pay  by  the  kilogram <period> anybody  drink  one  of  these  here  this  week <questionmark> you'd  pay  10,000  dollars  for  that  in  orbit <period> that  's  more  than  you  pay  for  ted <comma> if  google  dropped  their  sponsorship <period> the  second  is  more  than  90  percent  of  the  weight  of  a  vehicle  is  in  propellant <period> thus <comma> every  time  you'd  want  to  do  anything  in  space <comma> you  are  literally  blowing  away  enormous  sums  of  money  every  time  you  hit  the  accelerator <period> not  even  the  guys  at  tesla  can  fight  that  physics <period> so <comma> what  if  you  could  get  your  gas  at  a  10th  the  price <questionmark> there  is  a  place  where  you  can <period> in  fact <comma> you  can  get  it  better <comma> you  can  get  it  at  14  times  lower  if  you  can  find  propellant  on  the  moon <period> there  is  a  little-known  mission  that  was  launched  by  the  pentagon <comma> 13  years  ago  now <comma> called  clementine <period> and  the  most  amazing  thing  that  came  out  of  that  mission  was  a  strong  hydrogen  signature  at  shackleton  crater  on  the  south  pole  of  the  moon <period> that  signal  was  so  strong <comma> it  could  only  have  been  produced  by  10  trillion  tons  of  water  buried  in  the  sediment <comma> collected  over  millions  and  billions  of  years  by  the  impact  of  asteroids  and  comet  material <period> if  we  're  going  to  get  that <comma> and  make  that  gas  station  possible <comma> we  have  to  figure  out  ways  to  move  large  volumes  of  payload  through  space <period> we  cannot  do  that  right  now <period> the  way  you  normally  build  a  system  right  now  is  you  have  a  tube  stack  that  has  to  be  launched  from  the  ground <comma> and  resist  all  kinds  of  aerodynamic  forces <period> we  have  to  beat  that <period> we  can  do  it  because  in  space  there  are  no  aerodynamics <period> we  can  go  and  use  inflatable  systems  for  almost  everything <period> this  is  an  idea  that <comma> again <comma> came  out  of  livermore  back  in  1989 <comma> with  dr.  lowell  wood  's  group <period> and  we  can  extend  that  now  to  just  about  everything <period> bob  bigelow  currently  has  a  test  article  in  the  orbit <period> we  can  go  much  further <period> we  can  build  space  tugs <comma> orbiting  platforms  for  holding  cryogens  and  water <period> there  's  another  thing <period> when  you  're  coming  back  from  the  moon <comma> you  have  to  deal  with  orbital  mechanics <period> it  says  you  're  moving  10,000  feet  per  second  faster  than  you  really  want  to  be  to  get  back  to  your  gas  station <period> you  got  two  choices <period> you  can  burn  rocket  fuel  to  get  there <comma> or  you  can  do  something  really  incredible <period> you  can  dive  into  the  stratosphere <comma> and  precisely  dissipate  that  velocity <comma> and  come  back  out  to  the  space  station <period> it  has  never  been  done <period> it  's  risky  and  it  's  going  to  be  one  hell  of  a  ride <comma> better  than  disney <period> the  traditional  approach  to  space  exploration  has  been  that  you  carry  all  the  fuel  you  need  to  get  everybody  back  in  case  of  an  emergency <period> if  you  try  to  do  that  for  the  moon <comma> you  're  going  to  burn  a  billion  dollars  in  fuel  alone  sending  a  crew  out  there <period> but  if  you  send  a  mining  team  there <comma> without  the  return  propellant <comma> first <comma> did  any  of  you  guys  hear  the  story  of  cortez <questionmark> this  is  not  like  that <period> i  'm  much  more  like  scotty <period> i  like  this  equipment <comma> you  know <comma> and  i  really  value  it  so  we  're  not  going  to  burn  the  gear <period> but <comma> if  you  were  truly  bold  you  could  get  it  there <comma> manufacture  it <comma> and  it  would  be  the  most  dramatic  demonstration  that  you  could  do  something  worthwhile  off  this  planet  that  has  ever  been  done <period> there  's  a  myth  that  you  cannot  do  anything  in  space  for  less  than  a  trillion  dollars  and  20  years <period> that  's  not  true <period> in  seven  years <comma> we  could  pull  off  an  industrial  mission  to  shackleton  and  demonstrate  that  you  could  provide  commercial  reality  out  of  this  in  low-earth  orbit <period> we  're  living  in  one  of  the  most  exciting  times  in  history <period> we  're  at  a  magical  confluence  where  private  wealth  and  imagination  are  driving  the  demand  for  access  to  space <period> the  orbital  refueling  stations  i've  just  described  could  create  an  entirely  new  industry  and  provide  the  final  key  for  opening  space  to  the  general  exploration <period> to  bust  the  paradigm  a  radically  different  approach  is  needed <period> we  can  do  it  by  jump-starting  with  an  industrial  lewis  and  clark  expedition  to  shackleton  crater <comma> to  mine  the  moon  for  resources <comma> and  demonstrate  they  can  form  the  basis  for  a  profitable  business  on  orbit <period> talk  about  space  always  seems  to  be  hung  on  ambiguities  of  purpose  and  timing <period> i  would  like  to  close  here  by  putting  a  stake  in  the  sand  at  ted <period> i  intend  to  lead  that  expedition <period> it  can  be  done  in  seven  years  with  the  right  backing <period> those  who  join  me  in  making  it  happen  will  become  a  part  of  history  and  join  other  bold  individuals  from  time  past  who <comma> had  they  been  here  today <comma> would  have  heartily  approved <period> there  was  once  a  time  when  people  did  bold  things  to  open  the  frontier <period> we  have  collectively  forgotten  that  lesson <period> now  we  're  at  a  time  when  boldness  is  required  to  move  forward <period> 100  years  after  sir  ernest  shackleton  wrote  these  words <comma> i  intend  to  plant  an  industrial  flag  on  the  moon  and  complete  the  final  piece  that  will  open  the  space  frontier <comma> in  our  time <comma> for  all  of  us <period> thank  you <period> /transcript <period> believe  me  or  not <comma> i  come  offering  a  solution  to  a  very  important  part  of  this  larger  problem <comma> with  the  requisite  focus  on  climate <period> and  the  solution  i  offer  is  to  the  biggest  culprit  in  this  massive  mistreatment  of  the  earth  by  humankind <comma> and  the  resulting  decline  of  the  biosphere <period> that  culprit  is  business  and  industry <period> which  happens  to  be  where  i  have  spent  the  last  52  years  since  my  graduation  from  georgia  tech  in  1956 <period> as  an  industrial  engineer <comma> cum  aspiring  and  then  successful  entrepreneur <period> after  founding  my  company <comma> interface <comma> from  scratch  in  1973 <comma> 36  years  ago <comma> to  produce  carpet  tiles  in  america  for  the  business  and  institution  markets <comma> and  shepherding  it  through  start-up  and  survival  to  prosperity  and  global  dominance  in  its  field <comma> i  read  paul  hawken  's  book <comma> the  ecology  of  commerce <comma> the  summer  of  1994 <period> in  his  book <comma> paul  charges  business  and  industry  as <comma> one <comma> the  major  culprit  in  causing  the  decline  of  the  biosphere <comma> and <comma> two <comma> the  only  institution  that  is  large  enough <comma> and  pervasive  enough <comma> and  powerful  enough <comma> to  really  lead  humankind  out  of  this  mess <period> and  by  the  way  he  convicted  me  as  a  plunderer  of  the  earth <period> and  i  then  challenged  the  people  of  interface <comma> my  company <comma> to  lead  our  company  and  the  entire  industrial  world  to  sustainability <period> which  we  defined  as  eventually  operating  our  petroleum-intensive  company  in  such  a  way  as  to  take  from  the  earth  only  what  can  be  renewed  by  the  earth <comma> naturally  and  rapidly <comma> not  another  fresh  drop  of  oil <comma> and  to  do  no  harm  to  the  biosphere <period> take  nothing <comma> do  no  harm <period> i  simply  said <comma> if  hawken  is  right  and  business  and  industry  must  lead <comma> who  will  lead  business  and  industry <questionmark> unless  somebody  leads <comma> nobody  will <period> it  's  axiomatic <period> why  not  us <questionmark> and  thanks  to  the  people  of  interface <comma> i  have  become  a  recovering  plunderer <period> i  once  told  a  fortune  magazine  writer  that  someday  people  like  me  would  go  to  jail <period> and  that  became  the  headline  of  a  fortune  article <period> they  went  on  to  describe  me  as  america  's  greenest  ceo <period> from  plunderer  to  recovering  plunderer <comma> to  america  's  greenest  ceo  in  five  years  -- <period> that <comma> frankly <comma> was  a  pretty  sad  commentary  on  american  ceos  in  1999 <period> asked  later  in  the  canadian  documentary <comma> the  corporation <comma> what  i  meant  by  the  go  to  jail  remark <comma> i  offered  that  theft  is  a  crime <period> and  theft  of  our  children  's  future  would  someday  be  a  crime <period> but  i  realized <comma> for  that  to  be  true <comma> for  theft  of  our  children  's  future  to  be  a  crime <comma> there  must  be  a  clear <comma> demonstrable  alternative  to  the  take-make-waste  industrial  system  that  so  dominates  our  civilization <comma> and  is  the  major  culprit <comma> stealing  our  children  's  future <comma> by  digging  up  the  earth  and  converting  it  to  products  that  quickly  become  waste  in  a  landfill  or  an  incinerator  -- <period> in  short <comma> digging  up  the  earth  and  converting  it  to  pollution <period> according  to  paul  and  anne  ehrlich  and  a  well-known  environmental  impact  equation <comma> impact <comma> a  bad  thing <comma> is  the  product  of  population <comma> affluence  and  technology <period> that  is <comma> impact  is  generated  by  people <comma> what  they  consume  in  their  affluence <comma> and  how  it  is  produced <period> and  though  the  equation  is  largely  subjective <comma> you  can  perhaps  quantify  people <comma> and  perhaps  quantify  affluence <comma> but  technology  is  abusive  in  too  many  ways  to  quantify <period> so  the  equation  is  conceptual <period> still  it  works  to  help  us  understand  the  problem <period> so  we  set  out  at  interface <comma> in  1994 <comma> to  create  an  example <comma> to  transform  the  way  we  made  carpet <period> a  petroleum-intensive  product  for  materials  as  well  as  energy <period> and  to  transform  our  technologies  so  they  diminished  environmental  impact <comma> rather  than  multiplied  it <period> paul  and  anne  ehrlich  's  environmental  impact  equation <comma> i  is  equal  to  p  times  a  times  t: <period> population <comma> affluence  and  technology <period> i  wanted  interface  to  rewrite  that  equation  so  that  it  read  i  equals  p  times  a  divided  by  t <period> now <comma> the  mathematically-minded  will  see  immediately  that  t  in  the  numerator  increases  impact <comma> a  bad  thing  -- <period> but  t  in  the  denominator  decreases  impact <period> so  i  ask <comma> what  would  move  t <comma> technology <comma> from  the  numerator <comma> call  it  t1 <comma> where  it  increases  impact <comma> to  the  denominator <comma> call  it  t2 <comma> where  it  reduces  impact <questionmark> i  thought  about  the  characteristics  of  first  industrial  revolution <comma> t1 <comma> as  we  practiced  it  at  interface <comma> and  it  had  the  following  characteristics <period> extractive <comma> taking  raw  materials  from  the  earth <period> linear <comma> take <comma> make <comma> waste <period> powered  by  fossil  fuel-derived  energy <period> wasteful <comma> abusive  and  focused  on  labor  productivity <period> more  carpet  per  man-hour <period> thinking  it  through <comma> i  realized  that  all  those  attributes  must  be  changed  to  move  t  to  the  denominator <period> in  the  new  industrial  revolution  extractive  must  be  replaced  by  renewable <period> linear  by  cyclical <period> fossil  fuel  energy  by  renewable  energy <comma> sunlight <period> wasteful  by  waste-free <period> and  abusive  by  benign <period> and  labor  productivity  by  resource  productivity <period> and  i  reasoned  that  if  we  could  make  those  transformative  changes <comma> and  get  rid  of  t1  altogether <comma> we  could  reduce  our  impact  to  zero <comma> including  our  impact  on  the  climate <period> and  that  became  the  interface  plan  in  1995 <period> and  has  been  the  plan  ever  since <period> we  have  measured  our  progress  very  rigorously <period> so  i  can  tell  you  how  far  we  have  come  in  the  ensuing  12  years <period> net  greenhouse  gas  emissions  down  82  percent  in  absolute  tonnage <period> over  the  same  span  of  time  sales  have  increased  by  two-thirds  and  profits  have  doubled <period> so  an  82  percent  absolute  reduction  translates  into  a  90  percent  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  intensity  relative  to  sales <period> this  is  the  magnitude  of  the  reduction  the  entire  global  technosphere  must  realize  by  2050  to  avoid  catastrophic  climate  disruption  -- <period> so  the  scientists  are  telling  us <period> fossil  fuel  usage  is  down  60  percent  per  unit  of  production <comma> due  to  efficiencies  in  renewables <period> the  cheapest <comma> most  secure  barrel  of  oil  there  is  is  the  one  not  used  through  efficiencies <period> water  usage  is  down  75  percent  in  our  worldwide  carpet  tile  business <period> down  40  percent  in  our  broadloom  carpet  business <comma> which  we  acquired  in  1993  right  here  in  california <comma> city  of  industry <comma> where  water  is  so  precious <period> renewable  or  recyclable  materials  are  25  percent  of  the  total <comma> and  growing  rapidly <period> renewable  energy  is  27  percent  of  our  total <comma> going  for  100  percent <period> we  have  diverted  148  million  pounds <comma> that  's  74,000  tons <comma> of  used  carpet  from  landfills <period> closing  the  loop  on  material  flows  through  reverse  logistics  and  post-consumer  recycling  technologies  that  did  not  exist  when  we  started  14  years  ago <period> those  new  cyclical  technologies  have  contributed  mightily  to  the  fact  that  we  have  produced  and  sold  85  million  square  yards  of  climate-neutral  carpet  since  2004 <period> meaning  no  net  contribution  to  global  climate  disruption  in  producing  the  carpet  throughout  the  supply  chain <comma> from  mine  and  well  head  clear  to  end-of-life  reclamation  -- <period> independent  third-party  certified <period> we  call  it  cool  carpet <period> and  it  has  been  a  powerful  marketplace  differentiator <comma> increasing  sales  and  profits <period> three  years  ago  we  launched  carpet  tile  for  the  home <comma> under  the  brand  flor <comma> misspelled  f-l-o-r <period> you  can  point  and  click  today  at  florcom  and  have  cool  carpet  delivered  to  your  front  door  in  five  days <period> it  is  practical <comma> and  pretty  too <period> we  reckon  that  we  are  a  bit  over  halfway  to  our  goal <comma> zero  impact <comma> zero  footprint <period> we've  set  2020  as  our  target  year  for  zero <comma> for  reaching  the  top <comma> the  summit  of  mount  sustainability <period> we  call  this  mission  zero <period> and  this  is  perhaps  the  most  important  facet: <period> we  have  found  mission  zero  to  be  incredibly  good  for  business <period> a  better  business  model <period> a  better  way  to  bigger  profits <period> here  is  the  business  case  for  sustainability <period> from  real  life  experience <comma> costs  are  down <comma> not  up <comma> reflecting  some  400  million  dollars  of  avoided  costs  in  pursuit  of  zero  waste  -- <period> the  first  face  of  mount  sustainability <period> this  has  paid  all  the  costs  for  the  transformation  of  interface <period> and  this  dispels  a  myth  too <comma> this  false  choice  between  the  environment  and  the  economy <period> our  products  are  the  best  they've  ever  been <comma> inspired  by  design  for  sustainability <comma> an  unexpected  wellspring  of  innovation <period> our  people  are

is  astonishing <period> no  amount  of  advertising <comma> no  clever  marketing  campaign <comma> at  any  price <comma> could  have  produced  or  created  this  much  goodwill <period> costs <comma> products <comma> people <comma> marketplaces  -- <period> what  else  is  there <questionmark> it  is  a  better  business  model <period> and  here  is  our  14-year  record  of  sales  and  profits <period> there  is  a  dip  there <comma> from  2001  to  2003 <comma> a  dip  when  our  sales <comma> over  a  three-year  period <comma> were  down  17  percent <period> but  the  marketplace  was  down  36  percent <period> we  literally  gained  market  share <period> we  might  not  have  survived  that  recession  but  for  the  advantages  of  sustainability <period> if  every  business  were  pursuing  interface  plans <comma> would  that  solve  all  our  problems <questionmark> i  do  n't  think  so <period> i  remain  troubled  by  the  revised  ehrlich  equation <comma> i  equals  p  times  a  divided  by  t2 <period> that  a  is  a  capital  a <comma> suggesting  that  affluence  is  an  end  in  itself <period> but  what  if  we  reframed  ehrlich  further <questionmark> and  what  if  we  made  a  a  lowercase  a <comma> suggesting  that  it  is  a  means  to  an  end <comma> and  that  end  is  happiness  -- <period> more  happiness  with  less  stuff <period> you  know  that  would  reframe  civilization  itself <comma> and  our  whole  system  of  economics <comma> if  not  for  our  species <comma> then  perhaps  for  the  one  that  succeeds

thousand  generations <period> or  10,000  generations  -- <period> that  is  to  say <comma> into  the  indefinite  future <period> but  does  the  earth  have  to  wait  for  our  extinction  as  a  species <questionmark> well  maybe  so <period> but  i  do  n't  think  so <period> at  interface  we  really  intend  to  bring  this  prototypical  sustainable <comma> zero-footprint  industrial  company  fully  into  existence  by  2020 <period> we  can  see  our  way  now <period> clear  to  the  top  of  that  mountain <period> and  now  the  challenge  is  in  execution <period> and  as  my  good  friend  and  adviser  amory  lovins  says <comma> if  something  exists <comma> it  must  be  possible <period> if  we  can  actually  do  it <comma> it  must  be  possible <period> if  we <comma> a  petro-intensive  company  can  do  it <comma> anybody  can <period> and  if  anybody  can <comma> it  follows  that  everybody  can <period> hawken  fulfilled  business  and  industry <comma> leading  humankind  away  from  the  abyss <period> because <comma> with  continued  unchecked  decline  of  the  biosphere <comma> a  very  dear  person  is  at  risk  here  -- <period> frankly <comma> an  unacceptable  risk <period> who  is  that  person <questionmark> not  you <period> not  i <period> but  let  me  introduce  you  to  the  one  who  is  most  at  risk  here <period> and  i  myself  met  this  person  in  the  early  days  of  this  mountain  climb <period> on  a  tuesday  morning  in  march  of  1996 <comma> i  was  talking  to  people <comma> as  i  did  at  every  opportunity  back  then <period> bringing  them  along  and  often  not  knowing  whether  i  was  connecting <period> but  about  five  days  later  back  in  atlanta <comma> i  received  an  email  from  glenn  thomas <comma> one  of  my  people  in  the  california  meeting <period> he  was  sending  me  an  original  poem  that  he  had  composed  after  our  tuesday  morning  together <period> and  when  i  read  it  it  was  one  of  the  most  uplifting  moments  of  my  life <period> because  it  told  me <comma> by  god <comma> one  person  got  it <period> here  is  what  glenn  wrote <period> and  here  is  that  person <comma> most  at  risk <period> please  meet  tomorrow  's  child <period> without  a  name <comma> an  unseen  face <comma> and  knowing  not  your  time  or  place <comma> tomorrow  's  child <comma> though  yet  unborn <comma> i  met  you  first  last  tuesday  morn <period> a  wise  friend  introduced  us  two <period> and  through  his  sobering  point  of  view  i  saw  a  day  that  you  would  see <comma> a  day  for  you  but  not  for  me <period> knowing  you  has  changed  my  thinking <period> for  i  never  had  an  inkling  that  perhaps  the  things  i  do  might  someday <comma> somehow  threaten  you <period> tomorrow  's  child <comma> my  daughter <comma> son <comma> i  'm  afraid  i've  just  begun  to  think  of  you  and  of  your  good <comma> though  always  having  known  i  should <period> begin <comma> i  will <period> the  way  the  cost  of  what  i  squander <comma> what  is  lost <comma> if  ever  i  forget  that  you  will  someday  come  and  live  here  too <period> well <comma> every  day  of  my  life  since <comma> tomorrow  's  child  has  spoken  to  me  with  one  simple  but  profound  message <comma> which  i  presume  to  share  with  you <period> we  are <comma> each  and  every  one <comma> a  part  of  the  web  of  life <period> the  continuum  of  humanity <comma> sure <comma> but  in  a  larger  sense <comma> the  web  of  life  itself <period> and  we  have  a  choice  to  make  during  our  brief <comma> brief  visit  to  this  beautiful  blue  and  green  living  planet <comma> to  hurt  it  or  to  help  it <period> for  you <comma> it  's  your  call <period> thank  you <period> it  sure  used  to  be  a  lot  easier  to  be  from  iceland <comma> because  until  a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> people  knew  hardly  anything  about  us <comma> and  i  could  basically  come  out  here  and  say  only  good  things  about  us <period> but  in  the  last  couple  of  years  we've  become  infamous  for  a  couple  of  things <period> first <comma> of  course <comma> the  economic  meltdown <period> it  actually  got  so  bad  that  somebody  put  our  country  up  for  sale  on  ebay <period> ninety-nine  pence  was  the  starting  price  and  no  reserve <period> then  there  was  the  volcano  that  interrupted  the  travel  plans  of  almost  all  of  you  and  many  of  your  friends <comma> including  president  obama <period> by  the  way <comma> the  pronunciation  is  eyjafjallajokull <period> none  of  your  media  got  it  right <period> but  i  'm  not  here  to  share  these  stories  about  these  two  things  exactly <period> i  'm  here  to  tell  you  the  story  of  audur  capital <comma> which  is  a  financial  firm  founded  by  me  and  kristin <comma> who  you  see  in  the  picture <comma> in  the  spring  of  2007 <comma> just  over  a  year  before  the  economic  collapse  hit <period> why  would  two  women  who  were  enjoying  successful  careers  in  investment  banking  in  the  corporate  sector  leave  to  found  a  financial  services  firm <questionmark> well  let  it  suffice  to  say  that  we  felt  a  bit  overwhelmed  with  testosterone <period> and  i  'm  not  here  to  say  that  men  are  to  blame  for  the  crisis  and  what  happened  in  my  country <period> but  i  can  surely  tell  you  that  in  my  country <comma> much  like  on  wall  street  and  the  city  of  london  and  elsewhere <comma> men  were  at  the  helm  of  the  game  of  the  financial  sector <period> and  that  kind  of  lack  of  diversity  and  sameness  leads  to  disastrous  problems <period> so  we  decided <comma> a  bit  fed-up  with  this  world  and  also  with  the  strong  feeling  in  our  stomach  that  this  was  n't  sustainable <comma> to  found  a  financial  services  firm  based  on  our  values <period> and  we  decided  to  incorporate  feminine  values  into  the  world  of  finance <period> raised  quite  a  few  eyebrows  in  iceland <period> we  were  n't  known  as  the  typical  women  women  in  iceland  up  until  then <period> so  it  was  almost  like  coming  out  of  the  closet  to  actually  talk  about  the  fact  that  we  were  women  and  that  we  believed  that  we  had  a  set  of  values  and  a  way  of  doing  business  that  would  be  more  sustainable  than  what  we  had  experienced  until  then <period> and  we  got  a  great  group  of  people  to  join  us <comma> principled  people  with  great  skills <comma> and  investors  with  a  vision  and  values  to  match  ours <period> and  together  we  got  through  the  eye  of  the  financial  storm  in  iceland  without  taking  any  direct  losses  to  our  equity  or  to  the  funds  of  our  clients <period> and  although  i  want  to  thank  the  talented  people  of  our  company  foremost  for  that <comma> and  also  there  's  a  factor  of  luck  and  timing <comma> we  are  absolutely  convinced  that  we  did  this  because  of  our  values <period> so  let  me  share  with  you  our  values <period> we  believe  in  risk  awareness <period> what  does  that  mean <questionmark> we  believe  that  you  should  always  understand  the  risks  that  you  're  taking <comma> and  we  will  not  invest  in  things  we  do  n't  understand <period> not  a  complicated  thing <period> but  in  2007 <comma> at  the  height  of  the  sub-prime  and  all  the  complicated  financial  structures <comma> it  was  quite  opposite  to  the  reckless  risk-taking  behaviors  that  we  saw  on  the  market <period> we  also  believe  in  straight-talking <comma> telling  it  as  it  is <comma> using  simple  language  that  people  understand <comma> telling  people  about  the  downsides  as  well  as  the  potential  upsides <comma> and  even  telling  the  bad  news  that  no  one  wants  to  utter <comma> like  our  lack  of  belief  in  the  sustainability  of  the  icelandic  financial  sector  that  already  we  had  months  before  the  collapse  hit  us <period> and <comma> although  we  do  work  in  the  financial  sector <comma> where  excel  is  king <comma> we  believe  in  emotional  capital <period> and  we  believe  that  doing  emotional  due  diligence  is  just  as  important  as  doing  financial  due  diligence <period> it  is  actually  people  that  make  money  and  lose  money <comma> not  excel  spreadsheets <period> last <comma> but  not  least <comma> we  believe  in  profit  with  principles <period> we  care  how  we  make  our  profit <period> so  while  we  want  to  make  economic  profit  for  ourselves  and  our  customers <comma> we  are  willing  to  do  it  with  a  long-term  view <period> and  we  like  to  have  a  wider  definition  of  profits  than  just  the  economic  profit  in  the  next  quarter <period> so  we  like  to  see  profits <comma> plus  positive  social  and  environmental  benefits <comma> when  we  invest <period> but  it  was  n't  just  about  the  values <comma> although  we  are  convinced  that  they  matter <period> it  was  also  about  a  business  opportunity <period> it  's  the  female  trend <comma> and  it  's  the  sustainability  trend <comma> that  are  going  to  create  some  of  the  most  interesting  investment  opportunities  in  the  years  to  come <period> the  whole  thing  about  the  female  trend  is  not  about  women  being  better  than  men <period> it  is  actually  about  women  being  different  from  men <comma> bringing  different  values  and  different  ways  to  the  table <period> so  what  do  you  get <questionmark> you  get  better  decision-making <period> and  you  get  less  herd  behavior <period> and  both  of  those  things  hit  your  bottom  line  with  very  positive  results <period> but  one  has  to  wonder <comma> now  that  we've  had  this  financial  sector  collapse  upon  us  in  iceland <comma> and  by  the  way <comma> europe  looks  pretty  bad  right  now <period> and  many  would  say  that  you  in  america  are  heading  for  some  more  trouble  as  well <period> now  that  we've  had  all  that  happen <comma> and  we  have  all  this  data  out  there  telling  us  that  it  's  much  better  to  have  diversity  around  the  decision-making  tables <comma> will  we  see  business  and  finance  change <questionmark> will  government  change <questionmark> well  i  'll  give  you  my  straight  talk  about  this <period> i  have  days  that  i  believe <comma> but  i  have  days  that  i  'm  full  of  doubt <period> have  you  seen  the  incredible  urge  out  there  to  rebuild  the  very  things  that  failed  us <questionmark> einstein  said  that  this  was  the  definition  of  insanity <comma> to  do  the  same  things  over  and  over  again <comma> hoping  for  a  different  outcome <period> so  i  guess  the  world  is  insane <comma> because  i  see  entirely  too  much  of  doing  the  same  things  over  and  over  again <comma> hoping  that  this  time  it  's  not  going  to  collapse  upon  us <period> i  want  to  see  more  revolutionary  thinking <period> and  i  remain  hopeful <period> like  ted <comma> i  believe  in  people <period> and  i  know  that  consumers  are  becoming  more  conscious <comma> and  they  are  going  to  start  voting  with  their  wallets <comma> and  they  are  going  to  change  the  face  of  business  and  finance  from  the  outside <comma> if  they  do  n't  do  it  from  the  inside <period> but  i  'm  more  of  the  revolutionary <comma> and  i  should  be <period> i  'm  from  iceland <period> we  have  a  long  history  of  strong <comma> courageous <comma> independent  women <comma> ever  since  the  viking  age <period> and  i  want  to  tell  you  when  i  first  realized  that  women  matter  to  the  economy  and  to  the  society <comma> i  was  seven <comma> it  happened  to  be  my  mother  's  birthday <comma> october  24 <comma> 1975 <period> women  in  iceland  took  the  day  off <period> from  work  or  from  home <comma> they  took  the  day  off <comma> and  nothing  worked  in  iceland <period> they  marched  into  the  center  of  reykjavik <comma> and  they  put  women  's  issues  onto  the  agenda <period> and  some  say  this  was  the  start  of  a  global  movement <period> for  me  it  was  the  start  of  a  long  journey <comma> but  i  decided  that  day  to  matter <period> five  years  later <comma> iceland  elected  vigdis  finnbogadottir  as  their  president <comma> first  female  to  become  head  of  state <comma> single  mom <comma> a  breast  cancer  survivor  who  had  had  one  of  her  breasts  removed <period> and  at  one  of  the  campaign  sessions <comma> she  had  one  of  her  male  contenders  allude  to  the  fact  that  she  could  n't  become  president <comma> she  was  a  woman <comma> and  even  half  a  woman <period> that  night  she  won  the  election <comma> because  she  came  back <comma> not  just  because  of  his  crappy  behavior <comma> but  she  came  back  and  said <comma> well <comma> i  'm  actually  not  going  to  breastfeed  the  icelandic  nation <period> i  'm  going  to  lead  it <period> so  i've  had  incredibly  many  women  role  models  that  have  influenced  who  i  am  and  where  i  am  today <period> but  in  spite  of  that <comma> i  went  through  the  first  10  or  15  years  of  my  career  mostly  in  denial  of  being  a  woman <period> started  in  corporate  america <comma> and  i  was  absolutely  convinced  that  it  was  just  about  the  individual <comma> that  women  and  men  would  have  just  the  same  opportunities <period> but  i've  come  to  conclude  lately  that  it  is  n't  like  that <period> we  are  not  the  same <period> and  it  's  great <period> because  of  our  differences <comma> we  create  and  sustain  life <period> so  we  should  embrace  our  difference  and  aim  for  challenge <period> the  final  thought  i  want  to  leave  with  you  is  that  i  'm  fed  up  with  this  tyranny  of  either/or  choices  in  life <comma> either  it  's  men  or  it  's  women <period> we  need  to  start  embracing  the  beauty  of  balance <period> so  let  's  move  away  from  thinking  about  business  here  and  philanthropy  there <comma> and  let  's  start  thinking  about  doing  good  business <period> that  's  how  we  change  the  world <period> that  's  the  only  sustainable  future <period> thank  you <period> we  're  here  today  to  announce  the  first  synthetic  cell <comma> a  cell  made  by  starting  with  the  digital  code  in  the  computer <comma> building  the  chromosome  from  four  bottles  of  chemicals <comma> assembling  that  chromosome  in  yeast <comma> transplanting  it  into  a  recipient  bacterial  cell  and  transforming  that  cell  into  a  new  bacterial  species <period> so  this  is  the  first  self-replicating  species  that  we've  had  on  the  planet  whose  parent  is  a  computer <period> it  also  is  the  first  species  to  have  its  own  website  encoded  in  its  genetic  code <period> but  we  'll  talk  more  about  the  watermarks  in  a  minute <period> this  is  a  project  that  had  its  inception  15  years  ago  when  our  team  then <comma> we  called  the  institute  tigr <comma> was  involved  in  sequencing  the  first  two  genomes  in  history <period> we  did  haemophilus  influenzae  and  then  the  smallest  genome  of  a  self-replicating  organism <comma> that  of  mycoplasma  genitalium <period> and  as  soon  as  we  had  these  two  sequences  we  thought <comma> if  this  is  supposed  to  be  the  smallest  genome  of  a  self-replicating  species <comma> could  there  be  even  a  smaller  genome <questionmark> could  we  understand  the  basis  of  cellular  life  at  the  genetic  level <questionmark> it  's  been  a  15-year  quest  just  to  get  to  the  starting  point  now  to  be  able  to  answer  those  questions <period> because  it  's  very  difficult  to  eliminate  multiple  genes  from  a  cell <period> you  can  only  do  them  one  at  a  time <period> we  decided  early  on  that  we  had  to  take  a  synthetic  route <comma> even  though  nobody  had  been  there  before <comma> to  see  if  we  could  synthesize  a  bacterial  chromosome  so  we  could  actually  vary  the  gene  content  to  understand  the  essential  genes  for  life <period> that  started  our  15-year  quest  to  get  here <period> but  before  we  did  the  first  experiments <comma> we  actually  asked  art  caplan  's  team  at  the  university  of  pennsylvania  to  undertake  a  review  of  what  the  risks <comma> the  challenges <comma> the  ethics  around  creating  new  species  in  the  laboratory  were  because  it  had  n't  been  done  before <period> they  spent  about  two  years  reviewing  that  independently  and  published  their  results  in  science  in  1999 <period> ham  and  i  took  two  years  off  as  a  side  project  to  sequence  the  human  genome <comma> but  as  soon  as  that  was  done  we  got  back  to  the  task  at  hand <period> in  2002 <comma> we  started  a  new  institute <comma> the  institute  for  biological  energy  alternatives <comma> where  we  set  out  two  goals: <period> one <comma> to  understand  the  impact  of  our  technology  on  the  environment <comma> and  how  to  understand  the  environment  better <period> and  two <comma> to  start  down  this  process  of  making  synthetic  life  to  understand  basic  life <period> in  2003 <comma> we  published  our  first  success <period> so  ham  smith  and  clyde  hutchison  developed  some  new  methods  for  making  error-free  dna  at  a  small  level <period> our  first  task  was  a  5,000-letter  code  bacteriophage <comma> a  virus  that  attacks  only  e <period> coli <period> so  that  was  the  phage  phi  x  174 <comma> which  was  chosen  for  historical  reasons <period> it  was  the  first  dna  phage <comma> dna  virus <comma> dna  genome  that  was  actually  sequenced <period> so  once  we  realized  that  we  could  make  5,000-base  pair  viral-sized  pieces <comma> we  thought <comma> we  at  least  have  the  means  then  to  try  and  make  serially  lots  of  these  pieces  to  be  able  to  eventually  assemble  them  together  to  make  this  mega  base  chromosome <period> so <comma> substantially  larger  than  we  even  thought  we  would  go  initially <period> there  were  several  steps  to  this <period> there  were  two  sides: <period> we  had  to  solve  the  chemistry  for  making  large  dna  molecules <comma> and  we  had  to  solve  the  biological  side  of  how <comma> if  we  had  this  new  chemical  entity <comma> how  would  we  boot  it  up <comma> activate  it  in  a  recipient  cell <period> we  had  two  teams  working  in  parallel <comma> one  team  on  the  chemistry <comma> and  the  other  on  trying  to  entire  chromosomes  to  get  new  cells <period> when  we  started  this  out <comma> we  thought  the  synthesis  would  be  the  biggest  problem <comma> which  is  why  we  chose  the  smallest  genome <period> and  some  of  you  have  noticed  that  we  switched  from  the  smallest  genome  to  a  much  larger  one <period> and  we  can  walk  through  the  reasons  for  that <comma> but  basically  the  small  cell  took  on  the  order  of  one  to  two  months  to  get  results  from <comma> whereas  the  larger <comma> faster-growing  cell  takes  only  two  days <period> so  there  's  only  so  many  cycles  we  could  go  through  in  a  year  at  six  weeks  per  cycle <period> and  you  should  know  that  basically  99 <comma> probably  99  percent  plus  of  our  experiments  failed <period> so  this  was  a  debugging <comma> problem-solving  scenario  from  the  beginning  because  there  was  no  recipe  of  how  to  get  there <period> so <comma> one  of  the  most  important  publications  we  had  was  in  2007 <period> carole  lartigue  led  the  effort  to  actually  transplant  a  bacterial  chromosome  from  one  bacteria  to  another <period> i  think  philosophically <comma> that  was  one  of  the  most  important  papers  that  we've  ever  done  because  it  showed  how  dynamic  life  was <period> and  we  knew <comma> once  that  worked <comma> that  we  actually  had  a  chance  if  we  could  make  the  synthetic  chromosomes  to  do  the  same  with  those <period> we  did  n't  know  that  it  was  going  to  take  us  several  years  more  to  get  there <period> in  2008 <comma> we  reported  the  complete  synthesis  of  the  mycoplasma  genitalium  genome <comma> a  little  over  500,000  letters  of  genetic  code <comma> but  we  have  not  yet  succeeded  in  booting  up  that  chromosome <period> we  think  in  part <comma> because  of  its  slow  growth  and <comma> in  part <comma> cells  have  all  kinds  of  unique  defense  mechanisms  to  keep  these  events  from  happening <period> it  turned  out  the  cell  that  we  were  trying  to  transplant  into  had  a  nuclease <comma> an  enzyme  that  chews  up  dna  on  its  surface <comma> and  was  happy  to  eat  the  synthetic  dna  that  we  gave  it  and  never  got  transplantations <period> but  at  the  time <comma> that  was  the  largest  molecule  of  a  defined  structure  that  had  been  made <period> and  so  both  sides  were  progressing <comma> but  part  of  the  synthesis  had  to  be  accomplished  or  was  able  to  be  accomplished  using  yeast <comma> putting  the  fragments  in  yeast  and  yeast  would  assemble  these  for  us <period> it  's  an  amazing  step  forward <comma> but  we  had  a  problem  because  now  we  had  the  bacterial  chromosomes  growing  in  yeast <period> so  in  addition  to  doing  the  transplant <comma> we  had  to  find  out  how  to  get  a  bacterial  chromosome  out  of  the  eukaryotic  yeast  into  a  form  where  we  could  transplant  it  into  a  recipient  cell <period> so  our  team  developed  new  techniques  for  actually  growing <comma> cloning  entire  bacterial  chromosomes  in  yeast <period> so  we  took  the  same  mycoides  genome  that  carole  had  initially  transplanted <comma> and  we  grew  that  in  yeast  as  an  artificial  chromosome <period> and  we  thought  this  would  be  a  great  test  bed  for  learning  how  to  get  chromosomes  out  of  yeast  and  transplant  them <period> when  we  did  these  experiments <comma> though <comma> we  could  get  the  chromosome  out  of  yeast  but  it  would  n't  transplant  and  boot  up  a  cell <period> that  little  issue  took  the  team  two  years  to  solve <period> it  turns  out <comma> the  dna  in  the  bacterial  cell  was  actually  methylated <comma> and  the  methylation  protects  it  from  the  restriction  enzyme <comma> from  digesting  the  dna <period> so  what  we  found  is  if  we  took  the  chromosome  out  of  yeast  and  methylated  it <comma> we  could  then  transplant  it <period> further  advances  came  when  the  team  removed  the  restriction  enzyme  genes  from  the  recipient  capricolum  cell <period> and  once  we  had  done  that <comma> now  we  can  take  naked  dna  out  of  yeast  and  transplant  it <period> so  last  fall  when  we  published  the  results  of  that  work  in  science <comma> we  all  became  overconfident  and  were  sure  we  were  only  a  few  weeks  away  from  being  able  to  now  boot  up  a  chromosome  out  of  yeast <period> because  of  the  problems  with  mycoplasma  genitalium  and  its  slow  growth  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago <comma> we  decided  to  synthesize  the  much  larger  chromosome <comma> the  mycoides  chromosome <comma> knowing  that  we  had  the  biology  worked  out  on  that  for  transplantation <period> and  dan  led  the  team  for  the  synthesis  of  this  over  one-million-base  pair  chromosome <period> but  it  turned  out  it  was  n't  going  to  be  as  simple  in  the  end <period> and  it  set  us  back  three  months  because  we  had  one  error  out  of  over  a  million  base  pairs  in  that  sequence <period> so  the  team  developed  new  debugging  software <comma> where  we  could  test  each  synthetic  fragment  to  see  if  it  would  grow  in  a  background  of  wild  type  dna <period> and  we  found  that  10  out  of  the  11  100,000-base  pair  pieces  we  synthesized  were  completely  accurate  and  compatible  with  a  life-forming  sequence <period> we  narrowed  it  down  to  one  fragment <period> we  sequenced  it  and  found  just  one  base  pair  had  been  deleted  in  an  essential  gene <period> so  accuracy  is  essential <period> there  's  parts  of  the  genome  where  it  cannot  tolerate  even  a  single  error <comma> and  then  there  's  parts  of  the  genome  where  we  can  put  in  large  blocks  of  dna <comma> as  we  did  with  the  watermarks <comma> and  it  can  tolerate  all  kinds  of  errors <period> so  it  took  about  three  months  to  find  that  error  and  repair  it <period> and  then  early  one  morning <comma> at  6  am <period> we  got  a  text  from  dan  saying  that <comma> now <comma> the  first  blue  colonies  existed <period> so <comma> it  's  been  a  long  route  to  get  here <comma> 15  years  from  the  beginning <period> we  felt  one  of  the  tenets  of  this  field  was  to  make  absolutely  certain  we  could  distinguish  synthetic  dna  from  natural  dna <period> early  on <comma> when  you  're  working  in  a  new  area  of  science <comma> you  have  to  think  about  all  the  pitfalls  and  things  that  could  lead  you  to  believe  that  you  had  done  something  when  you  had  n't <comma> and <comma> even  worse <comma> leading  others  to  believe  it <period> so <comma> we  thought  the  worst  problem  would  be  a  single  molecule  contamination  of  the  native  chromosome <comma> leading  us  to  believe  that  we  actually  had  created  a  synthetic  cell <comma> when  it  would  have  been  just  a  contaminant <period> so  early  on <comma> we  developed  the  notion  of  putting  in  watermarks  in  the  dna  to  absolutely  make  clear  that  the  dna  was  synthetic <period> and  the  first  chromosome  we  built  in  2008 <comma> the  500,000-base  pair  one <comma> we  simply  assigned  the  names  of  the  authors  of  the  chromosome  into  the  genetic  code <period> but  it  was  using  just  amino  acid  single  letter  translations <comma> which  leaves  out  certain  letters  of  the  alphabet <period> so  the  team  actually  developed  a  new  code  within  the  code  within  the  code <period> so  it  's  a  new  code  for  interpreting  and  writing  messages  in  dna <period> now <comma> mathematicians  have  been  hiding  and  writing  messages  in  the  genetic  code  for  a  long  time <comma> but  it  's  clear  they  were  mathematicians  and  not  biologists  because <comma> if  you  write  long  messages  with  the  code  that  the  mathematicians  developed <comma> it  would  more  than  likely  lead  to  new  proteins  being  synthesized  with  unknown  functions <period> so  the  code  that  mike  montague  and  the  team  developed  actually  puts  frequent  stop  codons <period> so  it  's  a  different  alphabet  but  allows  us  to  use  the  entire  english  alphabet  with  punctuation  and  numbers <period> so <comma> there  are  four  major  watermarks  all  over  1,000  base  pairs  of  genetic  code <period> the  first  one  actually  contains  within  it  this  code  for  interpreting  the  rest  of  the  genetic  code <period> so  in  the  remaining  information <comma> in  the  watermarks <comma> contain  the  names  of <comma> i  think  it  's  46  different  authors  and  key  contributors  to  getting  the  project  to  this  stage <period> and  we  also  built  in  a  website  address  so  that  if  somebody  decodes  the  code  within  the  code  within  the  code <comma> they  can  send  an  email  to  that  address <period> so  it  's  clearly  distinguishable  from  any  other  species <comma> having  46  names  in  it <comma> its  own  web  address <period> and  we  added  three  quotations <comma> because  with  the  first  genome  we  were  criticized  for  not  trying  to  say  something  more  profound  than  just  signing  the  work <period> so  we  wo  n't  give  the  rest  of  the  code <comma> but  we  will  give  the  three  quotations <period> the  first  is <comma> to  live <comma> to  err <comma> to  fall <comma> to  triumph  and  to  recreate  life  out  of  life <period> it  's  a  james  joyce  quote <period> the  second  quotation  is <comma> see  things  not  as  they  are <comma> but  as  they  might  be <period> it  's  a  quote  from  the  american  prometheus  book  on  robert  oppenheimer <period> and  the  last  one  is  a  richard  feynman  quote: <period> what  i  cannot  build <comma> i  cannot  understand <period> so <comma> because  this  is  as  much  a  philosophical  advance  as  a  technical  advance  in  science <comma> we  tried  to  deal  with  both  the  philosophical  and  the  technical  side <period> the  last  thing  i  want  to  say  before  turning  it  over  to  questions  is  that  the  extensive  work  that  we've  done <comma> asking  for  ethical  review <comma> pushing  the  envelope  on  that  side  as  well  as  the  technical  side <comma> this  has  been  broadly  discussed  in  the  scientific  community <comma> in  the  policy  community  and  at  the  highest  levels  of  the  federal  government <period> even  with  this  announcement <comma> as  we  did  in  2003 <comma> that  work  was  funded  by  the  department  of  energy <comma> so  the  work  was  reviewed  at  the  level  of  the  white  house <comma> trying  to  decide  whether  to  classify  the  work  or  publish  it <period> and  they  came  down  on  the  side  of  open  publication <comma> which  is  the  right  approach  -- <period> we've  briefed  the  white  house <period> we've  briefed  members  of  congress <comma> we've  tried  to  take  and  push  the  policy  issues  in  parallel  with  the  scientific  advances <period> so  with  that <comma> i  would  like  to  open  it  first  to  the  floor  for  questions <period> yes <comma> in  the  back <period> reporter <comma> could  you  explain <comma> in  layman  's  terms <comma> how  significant  a  breakthrough  this  is  please <questionmark> craig  venter <comma> can  we  explain  how  significant  this  is <questionmark> i  'm  not  sure  we  're  the  ones  that  should  be  explaining  how  significant  it  is <period> it  's  significant  to  us <period> perhaps  it  's  a  giant  philosophical  change  in  how  we  view  life <period> we  actually  view  it  as  a  baby  step  in  terms  of <comma> it  's  taken  us  15  years  to  be  able  to  do  the  experiment  we  wanted  to  do  15  years  ago  on  understanding  life  at  its  basic  level <period> but  we  actually  believe  this  is  going  to  be  a  very  powerful  set  of  tools <period> and  we  're  already  starting  in  numerous  avenues  to  use  this  tool <period> we  have <comma> at  the  institute <comma> ongoing  funding  now  from  nih  in  a  program  with  novartis  to  try  and  use  these  new  synthetic  dna  tools  to  perhaps  make  the  flu  vaccine  that  you  might  get  next  year <period> because  instead  of  taking  weeks  to  months  to  make  these <comma> dan  's  team  can  now  make  these  in  less  than  24  hours <period> so  when  you  see  how  long  it  took  to  get  an  h1n1  vaccine  out <comma> we  think  we  can  shorten  that  process  quite  substantially <period> in  the  vaccine  area <comma> synthetic  genomics  and  the  institute  are  forming  a  new  vaccine  company  because  we  think  these  tools  can  affect  vaccines  to  diseases  that  have  n't  been  possible  to  date <comma> things  where  the  viruses  rapidly  evolve <comma> such  with  rhinovirus <period> would  n't  it  be  nice  to  have  something  that  actually  blocked  common  colds <questionmark> or <comma> more  importantly <comma> hiv <comma> where  the  virus  evolves  so  quickly  the  vaccines  that  are  made  today  cannot  keep  up  with  those  evolutionary  changes <period> also <comma> at  synthetic  genomics <comma> we've  been  working  on  major  environmental  issues <period> i  think  this  latest  oil  spill  in  the  gulf  is  a  reminder <period> we  cannot  see  co2 <comma> we  depend  on  scientific  measurements  for  it  and  we  see  the  beginning  results  of  having  too  much  of  it  -- <period> but  we  can  see  pre-co2  now  floating  on  the  waters  and  contaminating  the  beaches  in  the  gulf <period> we  need  some  alternatives  for  oil <period> we  have  a  program  with  exxon  mobile  to  try  and  develop  new  strains  of  algae  that  can  efficiently  capture  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere  or  from  concentrated  sources <comma> make  new  hydrocarbons  that  can  go  into  their  refineries  to  make  normal  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel  out  of  co2 <period> those  are  just  a  couple  of  the  approaches  and  directions  that  we  're  taking <period> i  have <comma> like <comma> a  thing  about  sleeping <period> i  do  n't  sleep  that  much <comma> and  i've  come  to  this  thing  about <comma> like <comma> not  sleeping  much  as  being  a  great  virtue <comma> after  years  of  kind  of  battling  it  as  being  a  terrible  detriment <comma> or  something <period> and  now  i  really  like  sort  of  sitting  up <comma> you  know <period> but  for  years  i've  been  sitting  up  and  i  think  that <comma> like <comma> my  creativity  is  greatly  motivated  by  this  kind  of  insomnia <period> i  lie  awake <period> i  think  thoughts <period> i  walk  aimlessly <period> sometimes  i  used  to  walk  more  at  night <period> i  walk  during  the  day  and  i  follow  people  who  i  think  look  interesting <period> and  sometimes <comma> actually <comma> once  it  was  on  page  six  in  the  post <comma> that  i  was  cruising  this  guy <comma> like <comma> sort  of <comma> whatever <comma> but  i  was  actually  just  following  because  he  had  these  really  great  shoes  on <period> and  so  i  was  following  this  guy <period> and  i  took  a  picture  of  his  shoes <comma> and  we  thanked  each  other  and  just  went  on  our  way <period> but  i  do  that  all  the  time <period> as  a  matter  of  fact <comma> i  think  a  lot  of  my  design  ideas  come  from  mistakes  and  tricks  of  the  eye <period> because  i  feel  like <comma> you  know <comma> there  are  so  many  images  out  there <comma> so  many  clothes  out  there <period> and  the  only  ones  that  look  interesting  to  me  are  the  ones  that  look  slightly  mistaken <comma> of  course <comma> or  very <comma> very  surprising <period> and  often <comma> i  'm  driving  in  a  taxi  and  i  see  a  hole  in  a  shirt <comma> or  something  that  looks  very  interesting  or  pretty  or  functional  in  some  way  that  i'd  never  seen  happen  before <period> and  so  i'd  make  the  car  stop <comma> and  i'd  get  out  of  the  car  and  walk <comma> and  see  that  in  fact  there  was  n't  a  hole <comma> but  it  was  a  trick  of  my  eye <comma> it  was  a  shadow <comma> you  know <period> or  if  there  was  a  hole  i'd  think  like <comma> oh  damn <comma> there  was  actually  someone  thought  of  that  thought  already <period> someone  made  that  mistake  already  so  i  cannot  do  it  anymore <period> i  do  n't  know  where  inspiration  comes  from <period> it  does  not  come  for  me  from  research <period> i  do  n't  get  necessarily  inspired  by  research <period> as  a  matter  of  fact <comma> one  of  the  most  fun  things  i've  ever <comma> ever  done  in  my  whole  life <comma> was  this  christmas  season  at  the  guggenheim  in  new  york <period> i  read  peter  and  the  wolf  with  this  beautiful  band  from  juilliard <period> and  i  did  like <comma> you  know <comma> the  narrator <comma> and  i  read  it <period> and  i  saw  this  really  smart  critic  who  i  love <period> this  woman <comma> joan  acocella <comma> who  's  a  friend  of  mine <comma> and  she  came  backstage  and  she  said <comma> oh <comma> you  know <comma> isaac <comma> did  you  know  that <comma> talking  about  stalinism  and  talking  about <comma> you  know <comma> like  the  30s  in  russia <period> and  i  said <comma> how  do  i  know  about  stalinism <questionmark> i  know  about  a  wolf  and  a  bird  and <comma> you  know <comma> he  ate  the  bird <comma> and  then  in  the  end  you  hear <comma> you  know <comma> you  hear  the  bird  squeaking <comma> or  something <comma> you  know <questionmark> so  i  do  n't  really  know  that <period> i  do  n't  really <comma> actually  i  do  my  own  kind  of  research <comma> you  know <period> if  i  'm  commissioned  to  do  the  costumes  for  an  18th-century  opera <comma> or  something  like  that <comma> i  will  do  a  lot  of  research <comma> because  it  's  interesting <comma> not  because  it  's  what  i  'm  supposed  to  do <period> i  'm  very <comma> very <comma> very  inspired  by  movies <period> the  color  of  movies  and  the  way  light  makes  the  colors <comma> light  from  behind  the  projection <comma> or  light  from  the  projection <comma> makes  the  colors  look  so  impossible <period> and  anyway <comma> roll  this  little  clip <comma> i  'll  just  show  you <period> i  sit  up  at  night  and  i  watch  movies  and  i  watch  women  in  movies  a  lot <period> and  i  think  about <comma> you  know <comma> their  roles <comma> and  about  how  you  have  to <comma> like <comma> watch  what  your  daughters  look  at <period> because  i  look  at  the  way  women  are  portrayed  all  the  time <period> whether  they  're  kind  of  glorified  in  this  way <comma> or  whether  they  're  kind  of <comma> you  know <comma> ironically  glorified <period> or  whether  they  're <comma> you  know <comma> sort  of  denigrated <comma> or  ironically  denigrated <period> i  go  back  to  color  all  the  time <period> color  is  something  that  motivates  me  a  lot <period> it  's  rarely  color  that  i  find  in  nature <comma> although <comma> you  know <comma> juxtaposed  next  to  artificial  color <comma> natural  color  is  so  beautiful <period> so  that  's  what  i  do <period> i  study  color  a  lot <period> but  for  the  most  part <comma> i  think <comma> like <comma> how  can  i  ever  make  anything  that  is  as  beautiful  as  that  image  of  natalie  wood <questionmark> how  can  i  ever  make  anything  as  beautiful  as  greta  garbo <questionmark> i  mean <comma> that  's  just  not  possible <comma> you  know <period> and  so  that  's  what  makes  me  lie  awake  at  night <comma> i  guess <comma> you  know <period> i  want  to  show  you <comma> i  'm  also  like  a  big <comma> i  go  to  astrologers  and  tarot  card  readers  often <comma> and  that  's  another  thing  that  motivates  me  a  lot <period> people  say <comma> oh <comma> do  that <period> an  astrologer  tells  me  to  do  something <period> so  i  do  it <period> when  i  was  about  21 <comma> an  astrologer  told  me  that  i  was  going  to  meet  the  man  of  my  dreams <comma> and  that  his  name  was  going  to  be  eric <comma> right <questionmark> so <comma> you  know <comma> for  years  i  would  go  to  bars  and <comma> sort  of <comma> anyone  i  met  whose  name  was  eric  i  was  humping  immediately <comma> or  something <period> and  there  were  times  when  i  was  actually  so  desperate  i  would  just <comma> you  know <comma> walk  into  a  room  and  just  go  like <comma> eric <period> and  anybody  who  would  turn  around  i  would <comma> sort  of <comma> make  a  beeline  for <period> and  i  had  this  really  interesting  tarot  reading  a  long  time  ago <period> the  last  card  he  pulled <comma> which  was  representing  my  destiny  was  this  guy  on  like  a  straw  boater  with  a  cane  and  you  know <comma> sort  of  spats  and  this <comma> you  know <comma> a  minstrel  singer <comma> right <questionmark> i  want  to  show  you  this  clip  because  i  do  this  kind  of  crazy  thing  where  i  do  a  cabaret  act <period> so  actually <comma> check  this  out <period> very  embarrassing <period>  <comma> thank  you <period> we  can  do  anything  you  ask <period> the  name  of  the  show  is  based  on  this  story  that  i  have  to  tell  you  about  my  mother <period> it  's  sort  of  an  excerpt  from  a  quote  of  hers <period> i  was  dating  this  guy <comma> right <questionmark> and  this  has  to  do  with  being  happy <comma> i  swear <period> i  was  dating  this  guy  and  it  was  going  on  for  about  a  year <comma> right <period> and  we  were  getting  serious <comma> so  we  decided  to  invite  them  all  to  dinner <comma> our  parents <period> and  we <comma> you  know <comma> sort  of  introduced  them  to  each  other <period> my  mother  was <comma> sort  of <comma> very  sensitive  to  his  mother <comma> who  it  seemed  was  a  little  bit  skeptical  about  the  whole  alternative  lifestyle  thing <period> you  know <comma> homosexuality <comma> right <questionmark> so  my  mother  was  a  little  offended <period> she  turned  to  her  and  she  said <comma> are  you  kidding <questionmark> they  have  the  greatest  life  together <period> they  eat  out <comma> they  see  shows <period> they  eat  out <comma> they  see  shows <period> that  's  the  name  of  the  show <comma> they  eat  out <comma> they <comma> that  's  on  my  tombstone  when  i  die <period> he  ate  out <comma> he  saw  shows <comma> right <questionmark> so  in  editing  these  clips <comma> i  did  n't  have  the  audacity  to  edit  a  clip  of  me  singing  at  joe  's  pub <period> so  you  'll  have  to <comma> like <comma> go  check  it  out  and  come  see  me  or  something <period> because  it  's  mortifying <comma> and  yet  it  feels <period> i  do  n't  know  how  to  put  this <period> i  feel  as  little  comfort  as  possible  is  a  good  thing <comma> you  know <period> and  at  least <comma> you  know <comma> in  my  case <comma> because  if  i  just  do  one  thing  all  the  time <comma> i  do  n't  know <comma> i  get  very <comma> very  bored <period> i  bore  very  easily <period> and  you  know <comma> i  do  n't  say  that  i  do  everything  well <comma> i  just  say  that  i  do  a  lot  of  things <comma> that  's  all <period> and  i  kind  of  try  not  to  look  back <comma> you  know <period> except <comma> i  guess <comma> that  's  what  staying  up  every  night  is  about <period> like <comma> looking  back  and  thinking <comma> what  a  fool  you  made  of  yourself <comma> you  know <period> but  i  guess  that  's  okay <period> right <questionmark> because  if  you  do  many  things  you  get  to  feel  lousy  about  everything <comma> and  not  just  one <comma> you  know <period> you  do  n't  master  feeling  lousy  about  one  thing <period> yeah <comma> exactly <period> i  will  show  you  this  next  thing <comma> speaking  of  costumes  for  operas <period> i  do  work  with  different  choreographers <period> i  work  with  twyla  tharp  a  lot <comma> and  i  work  with  mark  morris  a  lot <comma> who  is  one  of  my  best  friends <period> and  i  designed  three  operas  with  him <period> and  the  most  recent  one <comma> king  arthur <period> i'd  been  very  ingrained  in  the  dance  world  since  i  was  a  teenager <period> i  went  to  performing  arts  high  school <comma> where  i  was  an  actor <period> and  many  of  my  friends  were  ballet  dancers <period> again <comma> i  do  n't  know  where  inspiration  comes  from <period> i  do  n't  know  where  it  comes  from <period> i  started  making  puppets  when  i  was  a  kid <period> maybe  that  's  where  the  whole  inspiration  thing  started  from <comma> puppets <comma> right <period> and  then  performing  arts  high  school <period> there  i  was  in  high  school <comma> meeting  dancers  and  acting <period> and  somehow <comma> from  there <comma> i  got  interested  in  design <period> i  went  to  parsons  school  of  design  and  then  i  began  my  career  as  a  designer <period> i  do  n't  really  think  of  myself  as  a  designer <comma> i  do  n't  really  think  of  myself  necessarily  as  a  fashion  designer <period> and  frankly <comma> i  do  n't  really  know  what  to  call  myself <period> i  think  of  myself  as  a <period> i  do  n't  know  what  i  think  of  myself  as <period> it  's  just  that <period> but  i  must  say <comma> this  whole  thing  about  being  slightly  bored  all  the  time <comma> that  is  what <comma> i  think  that  is  a  very  important  thing  for  a  fashion  designer <period> you  always  have  to  be  slightly  bored  with  everything <period> and  if  you  're  not <comma> you  have  to  pretend  to  be  slightly  bored  with  everything <period> but  i  am  really  a  little  bored  with  everything <period> i  always  say  to  my  partner <comma> marisa  gardini <comma> who  books  everything <comma> she  books  everything  and  she  makes  everything  happen <period> and  she  makes  all  the  deals <period> and  i  always  tell  her  that  i  find  myself  with  a  lot  of  time  on  the  computer  bridge  program <period> too  much  time  on  computer  bridge <comma> which  is <comma> you  know <comma> like  that  's  so <period> somehow <comma> like <comma> about  ten  years  ago  i  thought  that  the  most  unboring  place  in  the  world  would  be  like  a  tv <period> studio <comma> like  for  a  day  show <period> some  kind  of  day  talk  show <period> because  it  's  all  of  these  things  that  i  love  all  kind  of  in  one  place <period> and  if  you  ever  get  bored  you  can  look  at  another  thing <comma> and  do  another  thing  and  talk  about  it <comma> right <questionmark> and  so  i  had  this  tv <period> show <period> and  that  was  a  very <comma> very <comma> very  big  part  of  my  process <period> actually <comma> could  you  roll  the  clip

mean  you  should  n't  have  kids <comma> because  you  know  they  're  going  to  end  up  getting  messed  up <questionmark> rod <comma> no <comma> but  it  means  that  your  priority  has  to  be  their  well-being  first <comma> i  think <period> but  you  have  to  make  the  decision  for  yourself <period> my  kids  are  seven <comma> who  the  hell  knows <period> they  're  going  to  be  like  14  and  in  rehab <period> and  they  're  going  to  be  playing  this  clip <comma> i  'm  such  a  good  mother <period> my  god <comma> this  is  the  shortest  i've  ever  had <period>

<comma> are  you  freaking  out <questionmark> you  look  so  cute <period> rod <comma> no <comma> i  love  it <period> it  's  the  new  me <period> im <comma> oh <comma> it  's  so  fabulous <period> rod <comma> flock  of  rosie <period> wooo <period> im <comma> so  by  the  way <period> of  all  the  most  unboring  things  in  the  world <comma> right <period> i  mean <comma> like  making  someone  who  's  already  cute  look  terrible  like  that <period> that  is  not  boring <period> that  is  nothing  if  it  's  not  boring <period> actually <comma> i  read  this  great  quote  the  other  day <comma> which  was <comma> style  makes  you  feel  great  because  it  takes  your  mind  off  the  fact  that  you  're  going  to  die  right <questionmark> and  then  i  realized <comma> that  was  on  my  website <comma> and  then  it  said <comma> like <comma> you  know <comma> the  quote  was  attributed  to  me  and  i  thought <comma> oh <comma> i  said  something <comma> you  know <comma> in  an  interview <period> i  forgot  that  i  said  that <period> but  it  's  really  true <period> i  want  to  show  you  this  last  clip  because  it  's  going  to  be  my  last  goodbye <period> i  'll  tell  you  that  i  cook  a  lot  also <period> i  love  to  cook <period> and  i  often  look  at  things  as  though  they  're  food <period> like  i  say <comma> oh <comma> you  know <comma> would  you  serve  a  rotten  chicken <questionmark> then  how  could  you  serve <comma> you  know <comma> a  beat  up  old  dress  or  something <period> how  could  you  show  a  beat  up  old  dress <questionmark> i  always  relate  things  to  kitchen-ry <period> and  so  i  think  that  's  what  it  all  boils  down  to <period> everything  boils  down  to  that <period> so  check  this  out <period> this  is  what  i've  been  doing  because  i  think  it  's  the  most  fun  thing  in  the  world <period> it  's <comma> like <comma> this  website <period> it  's  got  a  lot  of  different  things  on  it <period> it  's  a  polymathematical  website <period> we  actually  shoot  segments  like  tv <period> show  segments <period> and  it  's  kind  of  my  favorite  thing  in  the  world <period> and  it  just  began  like  in  the  beginning  of  february <period> so  who  knows <questionmark> and  again <comma> i  do  n't  say  it  's  good <comma> i  just  think  it  's  not  boring <comma> right <questionmark> and  here  is  the  last  bit <period> im <comma> i  have  to  tell  you <comma> i  make  buttermilk  pancakes  or  buttermilk  waffles  all  the  time <period> chef <comma> do  you <questionmark> im <comma> yeah <comma> but  i  can  never  find  buttermilk <comma> ever <period> chef <comma> oh <period> im <comma> you  cannot  find  buttermilk  at  citarella <period> you  cannot  find  buttermilk <period> chef <comma> you  cannot <questionmark> im <comma> it  's  always  low-fat  buttermilk <period> chef <comma> no <comma> but  that  's  all  it  is <period> im <comma> is  that  all  it  is <questionmark> chef <comma> oh <comma> you  do  n't  know <questionmark> let  me  tell  you  something <period> let  me  tell  you  something  interesting <period> im <comma> you  know  what <questionmark> stop  laughing <period> it  's  not  funny <period> just  because  i  do  n't  know  that  whole <comma> that  there  's  no  such  thing  as  whole  buttermilk <period> sorry <comma> what <questionmark> chef <comma> well <comma> here  's  the  deal <period> let  me  tell  you  the  deal <period> in  the  old  days  when  they  used  to  make  butter <comma> you  know  how  you  make  butter <questionmark> im <comma> churns <questionmark> chef <comma> for  cream <questionmark> im <comma> yeah <comma> exactly <period> chef <comma> so  you  take  heavy <comma> high-fat  milk <comma> which  is  cream <comma> and  you  churn  it  until  it  separates  into  these  curds  and  water <period> the  liquid  is  actually  that  clear  liquid <period> if  you've  ever  overbeaten  your  whipped  cream <comma> it  's  actually  buttermilk <period> and  that  's  what  it  was  in  the  early  days <period> and  that  's  what  people  used  for  baking  and  all  sorts  of  things <period> now <comma> the  buttermilk  that  you  get  is  actually  low-fat  or  skim  milk <period> im <comma> excuse  me <comma> i  did  n't  know <period> all  right <questionmark> chef <comma> the  reason  he  thought  that  is  because  buttermilk  is  so  wonderfully  thick  and  delicious <period> im <comma> yeah <comma> it  is <comma> exactly <period> so  who  would  think  that  it  was  low-fat <questionmark> well <comma> that  's  it <period> thank  you  very  much <period> happy  ted <period> it  's  so  wonderful  here <period> i  love  it <period> i  love  it <period> i  love  it <period> thanks <period> bye <period> i  heard  this  amazing  story  about  miuccia  prada <period> she  's  an  italian  fashion  designer <period> she  goes  to  this  vintage  store  in  paris  with  a  friend  of  hers <period> she  's  rooting  around <comma> she  finds  this  one  jacket  by  balenciaga  -- <period> she  loves  it <period> she  's  turning  it  inside  out <period> she  's  looking  at  the  seams <period> she  's  looking  at  the  construction <period> her  friend  says <comma> buy  it  already <period> she  said <comma> i  'll  buy  it <comma> but  i  'm  also  going  to  replicate  it <period> now <comma> the  academics  in  this  audience  may  think <comma> well <comma> that  sounds  like  plagiarism <period> but  to  a  fashionista <comma> what  it  really  is  is  a  sign  of  prada  's  genius <comma> that  she  can  root  through  the  history  of  fashion  and  pick  the  one  jacket  that  does  n't  need  to  be  changed  by  one  iota <comma> and  to  be  current  and  to  be  now <period> you  might  also  be  asking  whether  it  's  possible  that  this  is  illegal  for  her  to  do  this <period> well <comma> it  turns  out  that  it  's  actually  not  illegal <period> in  the  fashion  industry <comma> there  's  very  little  intellectual  property  protection <period> they  have  trademark  protection <comma> but  no  copyright  protection  and  no  patent  protection  to  speak  of <period> all  they  have <comma> really <comma> is  trademark  protection <period> and  so  it  means  that  anybody  could  copy  any  garment  on  any  person  in  this  room  and  sell  it  as  their  own  design <period> the  only  thing  that  they  cannot  copy  is  the  actual  trademark  label  within  that  piece  of  apparel <period> that  's  one  reason  that  you  see  logos  splattered  all  over  these  products <period> it  's  because  it  's  a  lot  harder  for  knock-off  artists  to  knock  off  these  designs  because  they  cannot  knock  off  the  logo <period> but  if  you  go  to  santee  alley <comma> yeah <period> well <comma> yeah <period> canal  street <comma> i  know <period> and  sometimes  these  are  fun <comma> right <questionmark> now <comma> the  reason  for  this <comma> the  reason  that  the  fashion  industry  does  n't  have  any  copyright  protection  is  because  the  courts  decided  long  ago  that  apparel  is  too  utilitarian  to  qualify  for  copyright  protection <period> they  did  n't  want  a  handful  of  designers  owning  the  seminal  building  blocks  of  our  clothing <period> and  then  everybody  else  would  have  to  license  this  cuff  or  this  sleeve  because  joe  blow  owns  it <period> but  too  utilitarian <questionmark> i  mean  is  that  the  way  you  think  of  fashion <questionmark> this  is  vivienne  westwood <period> no <period> we  think  of  it  as  maybe  too  silly <comma> too  unnecessary <period> now <comma> those  of  you  who  are  familiar  with  the  logic  behind  copyright  protection <comma> which  is  that  without  ownership <comma> there  is  no  incentive  to  innovate <comma> might  be  really  surprised  by  both  the  critical  success  of  the  fashion  industry  and  the  economic  success  of  this  industry <period> what  i  'm  going  to  argue  today  is  that  because  there  's  no  copyright  protection  in  the  fashion  industry <comma> fashion  designers  have  actually  been  able  to  elevate  utilitarian  design <comma> things  to  cover  our  naked  bodies <comma> into  something  that  we  consider  art <period> because  there  's  no  copyright  protection  in  this  industry <comma> there  's  a  very  open  and  creative  ecology  of  creativity <period> unlike  their  creative  brothers  and  sisters <comma> who  are  sculptors  or  photographers  or  filmmakers  or  musicians <comma> fashion  designers  can  sample  from  all  their  peers  designs <period> they  can  take  any  element  from  any  garment  from  the  history  of  fashion  and  incorporate  it  into  their  own  design <period> they  're  also  notorious  for  riffing  off  of  the  zeitgeist <period> and  here <comma> i  suspect <comma> they  were  influenced  by  the  costumes  in  avatar <period> maybe  just  a  little <period> ca  n't  copyright  a  costume  either <period> now <comma> fashion  designers  have  the  broadest  palette  imaginable  in  this  creative  industry <period> this  wedding  dress  here  is  actually  made  of  sporks <period> and  this  dress  is  actually  made  of  aluminum <period> i've  heard  this  dress  actually  sort  of  sounds  like  wind  chimes  as  they  walk  through <period> so <comma> one  of  the  magical  side  effects  of  having  a  culture  of  copying <comma> which  is  really  what  it  is <comma> is  the  establishment  of  trends <period> people  think  this  is  a  magical  thing <period> how  does  it  happen <questionmark> well <comma> it  's  because  it  's  legal  for  people  to  copy  one  another <period> some  people  believe  that  there  are  a  few  people  at  the  top  of  the  fashion  food  chain  who  sort  of  dictate  to  us  what  we  're  all  going  to  wear <period> but  if  you  talk  to  any  designer  at  any  level <comma> including  these  high-end  designers <comma> they  always  say  their  main  inspiration  comes  from  the  street <comma> where  people  like  you  and  me  remix  and  match  our  own  fashion  looks <period> and  that  's  where  they  really  get  a  lot  of  their  creative  inspiration <period> so  it  's  both  a  top-down  and  a  bottom-up  kind  of  industry <period> now <comma> the  fast  fashion  giants  have  probably  benefited  the  most  from  the  lack  of  copyright  protection  in  the  fashion  industry <period> they  are  notorious  for  knocking  off  high-end  designs  and  selling  them  at  very  low  prices <period> and  they've  been  faced  with  a  lot  of  lawsuits <comma> but  those  lawsuits  are  usually  not  won  by  fashion  designers <period> the  courts  have  said  over  and  over  again <comma> you  do  n't  need  any  more  intellectual  property  protection <period> when  you  look  at  copies  like  this <comma> you  wonder <comma> how  do  the  luxury  high-end  brands  remain  in  business <questionmark> if  you  can  get  it  for  200  bucks <comma> why  pay  a  thousand <questionmark> well <comma> that  's  one  reason  we  had  a  conference  here  at  usc  a  few  years  ago <period> we  invited  tom  ford  to  come  -- <period> the  conference  was  called <comma> ready  to  share <comma> fashion  and  the  ownership  of  creativity  -- <period> and  we  asked  him  exactly  this  question <period> here  's  what  he  had  to  say <period> he  had  just  come  off  a  successful  stint  as  the  lead  designer  at  gucci <comma> in  case  you  did  n't  know <period> tom  ford <comma> and  we  found  after  much  research  that <comma> actually  not  much  research <comma> quite  simple  research <comma> that  the  counterfeit  customer  was  not  our  customer <period> the  people  on  santee  alley  are  not  the  ones  who  shop  at  gucci <period> this  is  a  very  different  demographic <period> and <comma> you  know <comma> a  knock-off  is  never  the  same  as  an  original  high-end  design <comma> at  least  in  terms  of  the  materials <period> they  're  always  made  of  cheaper  materials <period> but  even  sometimes  a  cheaper  version  can  actually  have  some  charming  aspects <comma> can  breathe  a  little  extra  life  into  a  dying  trend <period> there  's  lots  of  virtues  of  copying <period> one  that  a  lot  of  cultural  critics  have  pointed  to  is  that  we  now  have  a  much  broader  palette  of  design  choices  to  choose  from  than  we  ever  have  before <period> and  this  is  mainly  because  of  the  fast  fashion  industry <comma> actually <period> and  this  is  a  good  thing <period> we  need  lots  of  options <period> fashion <comma> whether  you  like  it  or  not <comma> helps  you  project  who  you  are  to  the  world <period> because  of  fast  fashion <comma> global  trends  actually  get  established  much  more  quickly  than  they  used  to <period> and  this <comma> actually <comma> is  good  news  to  trendsetters <period> they  want  trends  to  be  set  so  that  they  can  move  product <period> for  fashionistas <comma> they  want  to  stay  ahead  of  the  curve <period> they  do  n't  want  to  be  wearing  what  everybody  else  is  wearing <period> and  so <comma> they  want  to  move  on  to  the  next  trend  as  soon  as  possible <period> i  tell  you <comma> there  is  no  rest  for  the  fashionable <period> every  season <comma> these  designers  have  to  struggle  to  come  up  with  the  new  fabulous  idea  that  everybody  's  going  to  love <period> and  this <comma> let  me  tell  you <comma> is  very  good  for  the  bottom  line <period> now  of  course <comma> there  's  a  bunch  of  effects  that  this  culture  of  copying  has  on  the  creative  process <period> and  stuart  weitzman  is  a  very  successful  shoe  designer <period> he  has  complained  a  lot  about  people  copying  him <period> but  in  one  interview  i  read <comma> he  said  it  has  really  forced  him  to  up  his  game <period> he  had  to  come  up  with  new  ideas <comma> new  things  that  would  be  hard  to  copy <period> he  came  up  with  this  bowden-wedge  heel  that  has  to  be  made  out  of  steel  or  titanium <period> if  you  make  it  from  some  sort  of  cheaper  material <comma> it  'll  actually  crack  in  two <period> it  forced  him  to  be  a  little  more  innovative <period> and  that  actually  reminded  me  of  jazz  great <comma> charlie  parker <period> i  do  n't  know  if  you've  heard  this  anecdote <comma> but  i  have <period> he  said  that  one  of  the  reasons  he  invented  bebop  was  that  he  was  pretty  sure  that  white  musicians  would  n't  be  able  to  replicate  the  sound <period> he  wanted  to  make  it  too  difficult  to  copy <period> and  that  's  what  fashion  designers  are  doing  all  the  time <period> they  're  trying  to  put  together  a  signature  look <comma> an  aesthetic  that  reflects  who  they  are <period> when  people  knock  it  off <comma> everybody  knows  because  they've  put  that  look  out  on  the  runway <comma> and  it  's  a  coherent  aesthetic <period> i  love  these  gallianos <period> okay <comma> we  'll  move  on <period> this  is  not  unlike  the  world  of  comedy <period> i  do  n't  know  if  you  know  that  jokes  also  cannot  be  copyright  protected <period> so  when  one-liners  were  really  popular <comma> everybody  stole  them  from  one  another <period> but  now <comma> we  have  a  different  kind  of  comic <period> they  develop  a  persona <comma> a  signature  style <comma> much  like  fashion  designers <period> and  their  jokes <comma> much  like  the  fashion  designs  by  a  fashion  designer <comma> really  only  work  within  that  aesthetic <period> if  somebody  steals  a  joke  from  larry  david <comma> for  instance <comma> it  's  not  as  funny <period> now <comma> the  other  thing  that  fashion  designers  have  done  to  survive  in  this  culture  of  copying  is  they've  learned  how  to  copy  themselves <period> they  knock  themselves  off <period> they  make  deals  with  the  fast  fashion  giants  and  they  come  up  with  a  way  to  sell  their  product  to  a  whole  new  demographic <comma> the  santee  alley  demographic <period> now <comma> some  fashion  designers  will  say <comma> it  's  only  in  the  united  states  that  we  do  n't  have  any  respect <period> in  other  countries  there  is  protection  for  our  artful  designs <period> but  if  you  take  a  look  at  the  two  other  biggest  markets  in  the  world <comma> it  turns  out  that  the  protection  that  's  offered  is  really  ineffectual <period> in  japan <comma> for  instance <comma> which  i  think  is  the  third  largest  market <comma> they  have  a  design  law <period> it  protects  apparel <comma> but  the  novelty  standard  is  so  high <comma> you  have  to  prove  that  your  garment  has  never  existed  before <period> it  's  totally  unique <period> and  that  's  sort  of  like  the  novelty  standard  for  a  us <period> patent <comma> which  fashion  designers  never  get <comma> rarely  get  here  in  the  states <period> in  the  european  union <comma> they  went  in  the  other  direction <period> very  low  novelty  standard <comma> anybody  can  register  anything <period> but  even  though  it  's  the  home  of  the  fast  fashion  industry  and  you  have  a  lot  of  luxury  designers  there <comma> they  do  n't  register  their  garments <comma> generally <comma> and  there  's  not  a  lot  of  litigation <period> it  turns  out  it  's  because  the  novelty  standard  is  too  low <period> a  person  can  come  in  and  take  somebody  else  's  gown <comma> cut  off  three  inches  from  the  bottom <comma> go  to  the  eu <period> and  register  it  as  a  new <comma> original  design <period> so <comma> that  does  not  stop  the  knock-off  artists <period> if  you  look  at  the  registry <comma> actually <comma> a  lot  of  the  registered  things  in  the  eu <period> are  nike  t-shirts  that  are  almost  identical  to  one  another <period> but  this  has  not  stopped  diane  von  furstenberg <period> she  is  the  head  of  the  council  of  fashion  designers  of  america <comma> and  she  has  told  her  constituency  that  she  is  going  to  get  copyright  protection  for  fashion  designs <period> the  retailers  have  kind  of  quashed  this  notion  though <period> i  do  n't  think  the  legislation  is  going  anywhere <period> because  they  realized  it  is  so  hard  to  tell  the  difference  between  a  pirated  design  and  something  that  's  just  part  of  a  global  trend <period> who  owns  a  look <questionmark> that  is  a  very  difficult  question  to  answer <period> it  takes  lots  of  lawyers  and  lots  of  court  time <period> and  the  retailers  decided  that  would  be  way  too  expensive <period> you  know <comma> it  's  not  just  the  fashion  industry  that  does  n't  have  copyright  protection <period> there  's  a  bunch  of  other  industries  that  do  n't  have  copyright  protection <comma> including  the  food  industry <period> you  cannot  copyright  a  recipe  because  it  's  a  set  of  instructions <comma> it  's  fact <period> and  you  cannot  copyright  the  look  and  feel  of  even  the  most  unique  dish <period> same  with  automobiles <period> it  does  n't  matter  how  wacky  they  look  or  how  cool  they  look <comma> you  cannot  copyright  the  sculptural  design <period> it  's  a  utilitarian  article <comma> that  's  why <period> same  with  furniture <period> it  's  too  utilitarian <period> magic  tricks <comma> i  think  they  're  instructions <comma> sort  of  like  recipes: <period> no  copyright  protection <period> hairdos <comma> no  copyright  protection <period> open  source  software <comma> these  guys  decided  they  did  n't  want  copyright  protection <period> they  thought  it'd  be  more  innovative  without  it <period> it  's  really  hard  to  get  copyright  for  databases <period> tattoo  artists <comma> they  do  n't  want  it <period> it  's  not  cool <period> they  share  their  designs <period> jokes <comma> no  copyright  protection <period> fireworks  displays <period> the  rules  of  games <period> the  smell  of  perfume <comma> no <period> and  some  of  these  industries  may  seem  sort  of  marginal  to  you <comma> but  these  are  the  gross  sales  for  low  ip <period> industries <comma> industries  with  very  little  copyright  protection <period> and  there  's  the  gross  sales  of  films  and  books <period> it  ai  n't  pretty <period> so  you  talk  to  people  in  the  fashion  industry  and  they  're  like <comma> shhh <period> do  n't  tell  anybody  we  can  actually  steal  from  each  other  's  designs <period> it  's  embarrassing <period> but  you  know  what <questionmark> it  's  revolutionary <period> and  it  's  a  model  that  a  lot  of  other  industries <comma> like  the  ones  we  just  saw  with  the  really  small  bars <comma> they  might  have  to  think  about  this <period> because  right  now <comma> those  industries  with  a  lot  of  copyright  protection  are  operating  in  an  atmosphere  where  it  's  as  if  they  do  n't  have  any  protection <period> and  they  do  n't  know  what  to  do <period> when  i  found  out  that  there  are  a  whole  bunch  of  industries  that  did  n't  have  copyright  protection <comma> i  thought <comma> what  exactly  is  the  underlying  logic <questionmark> i  want  a  picture  and  the  lawyers  do  not  provide  a  picture <period> so  i  made  one <period> these  are  the  two  main  sort  of  binary  oppositions  within  the  logic  of  copyright  law <period> it  is  more  complex  than  this <comma> but  this  will  do <period> first <comma> is  something  an  artistic  object <questionmark> then  it  deserves  protection <period> is  it  a  utilitarian  object <questionmark> then  no <comma> it  does  not  deserve  protection <period> this  is  a  difficult <comma> unstable  binary <period> the  other  one  is <comma> is  it  an  idea <questionmark> is  it  something  that  needs  to  freely  circulate  in  a  free  society <questionmark> no  protection <period> or  is  it  a  physically  fixed  expression  of  an  idea <comma> something  that  somebody  made  and  they  deserve  to  own  it  for  a  while  and  make  money  from  it <questionmark> the  problem  is  that  digital  technology  has  completely  subverted  the  logic  of  this  physically  fixed <comma> expression  versus  idea  concept <period> nowadays <comma> we  do  n't  really  recognize  a  book  as  something  that  sits  on  our  shelf  or  music  as  something  that  is  a  physical  object  that  we  can  hold <period> it  's  a  digital  file <period> it  is  barely  tethered  to  any  sort  of  physical  reality  in  our  minds <period> and  these  things <comma> because  we  can  copy  and  transmit  them  so  easily <comma> actually  circulate  within  our  culture  a  lot  more  like  ideas  than  like  physically  instantiated  objects <period> now <comma> the  conceptual  issues  are  truly  profound  when  you  talk  about  creativity  and  ownership  and <comma> let  me  tell  you <comma> we  do  n't  want  to  leave  this  just  to  lawyers  to  figure  out <period> they  're  smart <period> i  'm  with  one <period> he  's  my  boyfriend <comma> he  's  okay <period> he  's  smart <comma> he  's  smart <period> but  you  want  an  interdisciplinary  team  of  people  hashing  this  out <comma> trying  to  figure  out <comma> what  is  the  kind  of  ownership  model <comma> in  a  digital  world <comma> that  's  going  to  lead  to  the  most  innovation <questionmark> and  my  suggestion  is  that  fashion  might  be  a  really  good  place  to  start  looking  for  a  model  for  creative  industries  in  the  future <period> if  you  want  more  information  about  this  research  project <comma> please  visit  our  website <comma> it  's  readytoshareorg <period> and  i  really  want  to  thank  veronica  jauriqui  for  making  this  very  fashionable  presentation <period> thank  you  so  much <period> the  national  portrait  gallery  is  the  place  dedicated  to  presenting  great  american  lives <comma> amazing  people <period> and  that  's  what  it  's  about <period> we  use  portraiture  as  a  way  to  deliver  those  lives <comma> but  that  's  it <period> and  so  i  'm  not  going  to  talk  about  the  painted  portrait  today <period> i  'm  going  to  talk  about  a  program  i  started  there <comma> which <comma> from  my  point  of  view <comma> is  the  proudest  thing  i  did <period> i  started  to  worry  about  the  fact  that  a  lot  of  people  do  n't  get  their  portraits  painted  anymore <comma> and  they  're  amazing  people <comma> and  we  want  to  deliver  them  to  future  generations <period> so <comma> how  do  we  do  that <questionmark> and  so  i  came  up  with  the  idea  of  the  living  self-portrait  series <period> and  the  living  self-portrait  series  was  the  idea  of  basically  my  being  a  brush  in  the  hand  of  amazing  people  who  would  come  and  i  would  interview <period> and  so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is <comma> not  so  much  give  you  the  great  hits  of  that  program <comma> as  to  give  you  this  whole  notion  of  how  you  encounter  people  in  that  kind  of  situation <comma> what  you  try  to  find  out  about  them <comma> and  when  people  deliver  and  when  they  do  n't  and  why <period> now <comma> i  had  two  preconditions <period> one  was  that  they  be  american <period> that  's  just  because <comma> in  the  nature  of  the  national  portrait  gallery <comma> it  's  created  to  look  at  american  lives <period> that  was  easy <comma> but  then  i  made  the  decision <comma> maybe  arbitrary <comma> that  they  needed  to  be  people  of  a  certain  age <comma> which  at  that  point <comma> when  i  created  this  program <comma> seemed  really  old <period> sixties <comma> seventies <comma> eighties  and  nineties <period> for  obvious  reasons <comma> it  does  n't  seem  that  old  anymore  to  me <period> and  why  did  i  do  that <questionmark> well <comma> for  one  thing <comma> we  're  a  youth-obsessed  culture <period> and  i  thought  really  what  we  need  is  an  elders  program  to  just  sit  at  the  feet  of  amazing  people  and  hear  them  talk <period> but  the  second  part  of  it <comma> and  the  older  i  get <comma> the  more  convinced  i  am  that  that  's  true <period> it  's  amazing  what  people  will  say  when  they  know  how  the  story  turned  out <period> that  's  the  one  advantage  that  older  people  have <period> well <comma> they  have  other <comma> little  bit  of  advantage <comma> but  they  also  have  some  disadvantages <comma> but  the  one  thing  they  or  we  have  is  that  we've  reached  the  point  in  life  where  we  know  how  the  story  turned  out <period> so <comma> we  can  then  go  back  in  our  lives <comma> if  we've  got  an  interviewer  who  gets  that <comma> and  begin  to  reflect  on  how  we  got  there <period> all  of  those  accidents  that  wound  up  creating  the  life  narrative  that  we  inherited <period> so <comma> i  thought  okay <comma> now <comma> what  is  it  going  to  take  to  make  this  work <questionmark> there  are  many  kinds  of  interviews <period> we  know  them <period> there  are  the  journalist  interviews <comma> which  are  the  interrogation  that  is  expected <period> this  is  somewhat  against  resistance  and  caginess  on  the  part  of  the  interviewee <period> then  there  's  the  celebrity  interview <comma> where  it  's  more  important  who  's  asking  the  question  than  who  answers <period> that  's  barbara  walters  and  others  like  that <comma> and  we  like  that <period> that  's  frost-nixon <comma> where  frost  seems  to  be  as  important  as  nixon  in  that  process <period> fair  enough <period> but  i  wanted  interviews  that  were  different <period> i  wanted  to  be <comma> as  i  later  thought  of  it <comma> empathic <comma> which  is  to  say <comma> to  feel  what  they  wanted  to  say  and  to  be  an  agent  of  their  self-revelation <period> by  the  way <comma> this  was  always  done  in  public <period> this  was  not  an  oral  history  program <period> this  was  all  about  300  people  sitting  at  the  feet  of  this  individual <comma> and  having  me  be  the  brush  in  their  self-portrait <period> now <comma> it  turns  out  that  i  was  pretty  good  at  that <period> i  did  n't  know  it  coming  into  it <period> and  the  only  reason  i  really  know  that  is  because  of  one  interview  i  did  with  senator  william  fulbright <comma> and  that  was  six  months  after  he'd  had  a  stroke <period> and  he  had  never  appeared  in  public  since  that  point <period> this  was  not  a  devastating  stroke <comma> but  it  did  affect  his  speaking  and  so  forth <period> and  i  thought  it  was  worth  a  chance <comma> he  thought  it  was  worth  a  chance <comma> and  so  we  got  up  on  the  stage <comma> and  we  had  an  hour  conversation  about  his  life <comma> and  after  that  a  woman  rushed  up  to  me <comma> essentially  did <comma> and  she  said <comma> where  did  you  train  as  a  doctor <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> i  have  no  training  as  a  doctor <period> i  never  claimed  that <period> and  she  said <comma> well <comma> something  very  weird  was  happening <period> when  he  started  a  sentence <comma> particularly  in  the  early  parts  of  the  interview <comma> and  paused <comma> you  gave  him  the  word <comma> the  bridge  to  get  to  the  end  of  the  sentence <comma> and  by  the  end  of  it <comma> he  was  speaking  complete  sentences  on  his  own <period> i  did  n't  know  what  was  going  on <comma> but  i  was  so  part  of  the  process  of  getting  that  out <period> so  i  thought <comma> okay <comma> fine <comma> i've  got  empathy <comma> or  empathy <comma> at  any  rate <comma> is  what  's  critical  to  this  kind  of  interview <period> but  then  i  began  to  think  of  other  things <period> who  makes  a  great  interview  in  this  context <questionmark> it  had  nothing  to  do  with  their  intellect <comma> the  quality  of  their  intellect <period> some  of  them  were  very  brilliant <comma> some  of  them  were <comma> you  know <comma> ordinary  people  who  would  never  claim  to  be  intellectuals <comma> but  it  was  never  about  that <period> it  was  about  their  energy <period> it  's  energy  that  creates  extraordinary  interviews  and  extraordinary  lives <period> i  'm  convinced  of  it <period> and  it  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  energy  of  being  young <period> these  were  people  through  their  90s <period> in  fact <comma> the  first  person  i  interviewed  was  george  abbott <comma> who  was  97 <comma> and  abbott  was  filled  with  the  life  force <comma> i  guess  that  's  the  way  i  think  about  it <comma> filled  with  it <period> and  so  he  filled  the  room <comma> and  we  had  an  extraordinary  conversation <period> he  was  supposed  to  be  the  toughest  interview  that  anybody  would  ever  do  because  he  was  famous  for  being  silent <comma> for  never  ever  saying  anything  except  maybe  a  word  or  two <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> he  did  wind  up  opening  up <comma> by  the  way <comma> his  energy  is  evidenced  in  other  ways <period> he  subsequently  got  married  again  at  102 <comma> so  he <comma> you  know <comma> he  had  a  lot  of  the  life  force  in  him <period> but  after  the  interview <comma> i  got  a  call <comma> very  gruff  voice <comma> from  a  woman <period> i  did  n't  know  who  she  was <comma> and  she  said <comma> did  you  get  george  abbott  to  talk <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> yeah <period> apparently  i  did <period> and  she  said <comma> i  'm  his  old  girlfriend <comma> maureen  stapleton <comma> and  i  could  never  do  it <period> and  then  she  made  me  go  up  with  the  tape  of  it  and  prove  that  george  abbott  actually  could  talk <period> so <comma> you  know <comma> you  want  energy <comma> you  want  the  life  force <comma> but  you  really  want  them  also  to  think  that  they  have  a  story  worth  sharing <period> the  worst  interviews  that  you  can  ever  have  are  with  people  who  are  modest <period> never  ever  get  up  on  a  stage  with  somebody  who  's  modest <comma> because  all  of  these  people  have  been  assembled  to  listen  to  them <comma> and  they  sit  there  and  they  say <comma> aw <comma> shucks <comma> it  was  an  accident <period> there  's  nothing  that  ever  happens  that  justifies  people  taking  good  hours  of  the  day  to  be  with  them <period> the  worst  interview  i  ever  did <comma> william  l <period> shirer <period> the  journalist  who  did  the  rise  and  fall  of  the  third  reich  this  guy  had  met  hitler  and  gandhi  within  six  months <comma> and  every  time  i'd  ask  him  about  it <comma> he'd  say <comma> oh <comma> i  just  happened  to  be  there <period> did  n't  matter  whatever <period> awful <period> i  never  would  ever  agree  to  interview  a  modest  person <period> they  have  to  think  that  they  did  something  and  that  they  want  to  share  it  with  you <period> but  it  comes  down <comma> in  the  end <comma> to  how  do  you  get  through  all  the  barriers  we  have <period> all  of  us  are  public  and  private  beings <comma> and  if  all  you  're  going  to  get  from  the  interviewee  is  their  public  self <comma> there  's  no  point  in  it <period> it  's  pre-programmed <period> it  's  infomercial <comma> and  we  all  have  infomercials  about  our  lives <period> we  know  the  great  lines <comma> we  know  the  great  moments <comma> we  know  what  we  're  not  going  to  share <comma> and  the  point  of  this  was  not  to  embarrass  anybody <period> this  was  n't <comma> and  some  of  you  will  remember  mike  wallace  's  old  interviews <comma> tough <comma> aggressive  and  so  forth <period> they  have  their  place <period> i  was  trying  to  get  them  to  say  what  they  probably  wanted  to  say <comma> to  break  out  of  their  own  cocoon  of  the  public  self <comma> and  the  more  public  they  had  been <comma> the  more  entrenched  that  person <comma> that  outer  person  was <period> and  let  me  tell  you  at  once  the  worse  moment  and  the  best  moment  that  happened  in  this  interview  series <period> it  all  has  to  do  with  that  shell  that  most  of  us  have <comma> and  particularly  certain  people <period> there  's  an  extraordinary  woman  named  clare  boothe  luce <period> it  'll  be  your  generational  determinant  as  to  whether  her  name  means  much  to  you <period> she  did  so  much <period> she  was  a  playwright <period> she  did  an  extraordinary  play  called  the  women <period> she  was  a  congresswoman  when  there  were  n't  very  many  congresswomen <period> she  was  editor  of  vanity  fair <comma> one  of  the  great  phenomenal  women  of  her  day <period> and <comma> incidentally <comma> i  call  her  the  eleanor  roosevelt  of  the  right <period> she  was  sort  of  adored  on  the  right  the  way  eleanor  roosevelt  was  on  the  left <period> and <comma> in  fact <comma> when  we  did  the  interview <comma> i  did  the  living  self-portrait  with  her <comma> there  were  three  former  directors  of  the  cia  basically  sitting  at  her  feet <comma> just  enjoying  her  presence <period> and  i  thought <comma> this  is  going  to  be  a  piece  of  cake <comma> because  i  always  have  preliminary  talks  with  these  people  for  just  maybe  10  or  15  minutes <period> we  never  talk  before  that  because  if  you  talk  before <comma> you  do  n't  get  it  on  the  stage <period> so  she  and  i  had  a  delightful  conversation <period> we  were  on  the  stage  and  then <comma> by  the  way <comma> spectacular <period> it  was  all  part  of  clare  boothe  luce  's  look <period> she  was  in  a  great  evening  gown <period> she  was  80 <comma> almost  that  day  of  the  interview <comma> and  there  she  was  and  there  i  was <comma> and  i  just  proceeded  into  the  questions <period> and  she  stonewalled  me <period> it  was  unbelievable <period> anything  that  i  would  ask <comma> she  would  turn  around <comma> dismiss <comma> and  i  was  basically  up  there <comma> any  of  you  in  the  moderate-to-full  entertainment  world  know  what  it  is  to  die  onstage <period> and  i  was  dying <period> she  was  absolutely  not  giving  me  a  thing <period> and  i  began  to  wonder  what  was  going  on <comma> and  you  think  while  you  talk <comma> and  basically <comma> i  thought <comma> i  got  it <period> when  we  were  alone <comma> i  was  her  audience <period> now  i  'm  her  competitor  for  the  audience <period> that  's  the  problem  here <comma> and  she  's  fighting  me  for  that <comma> and  so  then  i  asked  her  a  question <comma> i  did  n't  know  how  i  was  going  to  get  out  of  it <comma> i  asked  her  a  question  about  her  days  as  a  playwright <comma> and  again <comma> characteristically <comma> instead  of  saying <comma> oh  yes <comma> i  was  a  playwright <comma> and  this  is  what  blah  blah  blah <comma> she  said <comma> oh <comma> playwright <period> everybody  knows  i  was  a  playwright <period> most  people  think  that  i  was  an  actress <period> i  was  never  an  actress <period> but  i  had  n't  asked  that <comma> and  then  she  went  off  on  a  tear <comma> and  she  said <comma> oh <comma> well <comma> there  was  that  one  time  that  i  was  an  actress <period> it  was  for  a  charity  in  connecticut  when  i  was  a  congresswoman <comma> and  i  got  up  there <comma> and  she  went  on  and  on <comma> and  then  i  got  on  the  stage <period> and  then  she  turned  to  me  and  said <comma> and  you  know  what  those  young  actors  did <questionmark> they  upstaged  me  and  she  said <comma> do  you  know  what  that  is <questionmark> just  withering  in  her  contempt <period> and  i  said <comma> i  'm  learning <period> and  she  looked  at  me <comma> and  it  was  like  the  successful  arm-wrestle <comma> and  then <comma> after  that <comma> she  delivered  an  extraordinary  account  of  what  her  life  really  was  like <period> i  have  to  end  that  one <period> this  is  my  tribute  to  clare  boothe  luce <period> again <comma> a  remarkable  person <period> i  'm  not  politically  attracted  to  her <comma> but  through  her  life  force <comma> i  'm  attracted  to  her <period> and  the  way  she  died <comma> she  had <comma> toward  the  end <comma> a  brain  tumor <period> that  's  probably  as  terrible  a  way  to  die  as  you  can  imagine <comma> and  very  few  of  us  were  invited  to  a  dinner  party <period> and  she  was  in  horrible  pain <period> we  all  knew  that <period> she  stayed  in  her  room <period> everybody  came <period> the  butler  passed  around  canapes <period> the  usual  sort  of  thing <period> then  at  a  certain  moment <comma> the  door  opened  and  she  walked  out  perfectly  dressed <comma> completely  composed <period> the  public  self <comma> the  beauty <comma> the  intellect <comma> and  she  walked  around  and  talked  to  every  person  there  and  then  went  back  into  the  room  and  was  never  seen  again <period> she  wanted  the  control  of  her  final  moment <comma> and  she  did  it  amazingly <period> now <comma> there  are  other  ways  that  you  get  somebody  to  open  up <comma> and  this  is  just  a  brief  reference <period> it  was  n't  this  arm-wrestle <comma> but  it  was  a  little  surprising  for  the  person  involved <period> i  interviewed  steve  martin <period> it  was  n't  all  that  long  ago <period> and  we  were  sitting  there <comma> and  almost  toward  the  beginning  of  the  interview <comma> i  turned  to  him  and  i  said <comma> steve <comma> or  mr.  martin <comma> it  is  said  that  all  comedians  have  unhappy  childhoods <period> was  yours  unhappy <questionmark> and  he  looked  at  me <comma> you  know <comma> as  if  to  say <comma> this  is  how  you  're  going  to  start  this  thing <comma> right  off <questionmark> and  then  he  turned  to  me <comma> not  stupidly <comma> and  he  said <comma> what  was  your  childhood  like <questionmark> and  i  said <comma> these  are  all  arm  wrestles <comma> but  they  're  affectionate <comma> and  i  said <comma> my  father  was  loving  and  supportive <comma> which  is  why  i  'm  not  funny <period> and  he  looked  at  me <comma> and  then  we  heard  the  big  sad  story <period> his  father  was  an  sob <comma> and <comma> in  fact <comma> he  was  another  comedian  with  an  unhappy  childhood <comma> but  then  we  were  off  and  running <period> so  the  question  is <comma> what  is  the  key  that  's  going  to  allow  this  to  proceed <questionmark> now <comma> these  are  arm  wrestle  questions <comma> but  i  want  to  tell  you  about  questions  that  are  more  related  to  empathy  and  that  really <comma> very  often <comma> are  the  questions  that  people  have  been  waiting  their  whole  lives  to  be  asked <period> and  i  'll  just  give  you  two  examples  of  this  because  of  the  time  constraints <period> one  was  an  interview  i  did  with  one  of  the  great  american  biographers <period> again <comma> some  of  you  will  know  him <comma> most  of  you  wo  n't <comma> dumas  malone <period> he  did  a  five-volume  biography  of  thomas  jefferson <comma> spent  virtually  his  whole  life  with  thomas  jefferson <comma> and  by  the  way <comma> at  one  point  i  asked  him <comma> would  you  like  to  have  met  him <questionmark> and  he  said <comma> well <comma> of  course <comma> but  actually <comma> i  know  him  better  than  anyone  who  ever  met  him <comma> because  i  got  to  read  all  of  his  letters <period> so <comma> he  was  very  satisfied  with  the  kind  of  relationship  they  had  over  50  years <period> and  i  asked  him  one  question <period> i  said <comma> did  jefferson  ever  disappoint  you <questionmark> and  here  is  this  man  who  had  given  his  whole  life  to  uncovering  jefferson  and  connecting  with  him <comma> and  he  said <comma> well   <comma> i  'm  going  to  do  a  bad  southern  accent <period> dumas  malone  was  from  mississippi  originally <period> but  he  said <comma> well <comma> he  said <comma> i  'm  afraid  so <period> he  said <comma> you  know <comma> i've  read  everything <comma> and  sometimes  mr.  jefferson  would  smooth  the  truth  a  bit <period> and  he  basically  was  saying  that  this  was  a  man  who  lied  more  than  he  wished  he  had <comma> because  he  saw  the  letters <period> he  said <comma> but  i  understand  that  he  said <comma> i  understand  that <period> he  said <comma> we  southerners  do  like  a  smooth  surface <comma> so  that  there  were  times  when  he  just  did  n't  want  the  confrontation <period> and  he  said <comma> now <comma> john  adams  was  too  honest <period> and  he  started  to  talk  about  that <comma> and  later  on  he  invited  me  to  his  house <comma> and  i  met  his  wife  who  was  from  massachusetts <comma> and  he  and  she  had  exactly  the  relationship  of  thomas  jefferson  and  john  adams <period> she  was  the  new  englander  and  abrasive <comma> and  he  was  this  courtly  fellow <period> but  really  the  most  important  question  i  ever  asked <comma> and  most  of  the  times  when  i  talk  about  it <comma> people  kind  of  suck  in  their  breath  at  my  audacity <comma> or  cruelty <comma> but  i  promise  you  it  was  the  right  question <period> this  was  to  agnes  de  mille <period> agnes  de  mille  is  one  of  the  great  choreographers  in  our  history <period> she  basically  created  the  dances  in  oklahoma <comma> transforming  the  american  theater <period> an  amazing  woman <period> at  the  time  that  i  proposed  to  her  that <comma> by  the  way <comma> i  would  have  proposed  to  her <period> she  was  extraordinary <comma> but  proposed  to  her  that  she  come  on <period> she  said <comma> come  to  my  apartment <period> she  lived  in  new  york <period> come  to  my  apartment  and  we  'll  talk  for  those  15  minutes <comma> and  then  we  'll  decide  whether  we  proceed <period> and  so  i  showed  up  in  this  dark <comma> rambling  new  york  apartment <comma> and  she  called  out  to  me <comma> and  she  was  in  bed <period> i  had  known  that  she  had  had  a  stroke <comma> and  that  was  some  10  years  before <period> and  so  she  spent  almost  all  of  her  life  in  bed <comma> but <comma> i  speak  of  the  life  force <comma> her  hair  was  askew <period> she  was  n't  about  to  make  up  for  this  occasion <period> and  she  was  sitting  there  surrounded  by  books <comma> and  her  most  interesting  possession  she  felt  at  that  moment  was  her  will <comma> which  she  had  by  her  side <period> she  was  n't  unhappy  about  this <period> she  was  resigned <period> she  said <comma> i  keep  this  will  by  my  bed <comma> memento  mori <comma> and  i  change  it  all  the  time  just  because  i  want  to <period> and  she  was  loving  the  prospect  of  death  as  much  as  she  had  loved  life <period> i  thought <comma> this  is  somebody  i've  got  to  get  in  this  series <period> she  agreed <period> she  came  on <period> of  course  she  was  wheelchaired  on <period> half  of  her  body  was  stricken <comma> the  other  half  not <period> she  was <comma> of  course <comma> done  up  for  the  occasion <comma> but  this  was  a  woman  in  great  physical  distress <period> and  we  had  a  conversation <period> and  then  i  asked  her  this  unthinkable  question <period> i  said <comma> was  it  a  problem  for  you  in  your  life  that  you  were  not  beautiful <questionmark> and  the  audience  just <comma> you  know <comma> they  're  always  on  the  side  of  the  interviewee <comma> and  they  felt  that  this  was  a  kind  of  assault <comma> but  this  was  the  question  she  had  wanted  somebody  to  ask  her  whole  life <period> and  she  began  to  talk  about  her  childhood <comma> when  she  was  beautiful <comma> and  she  literally  turned <comma> here  she  was <comma> in  this  broken  body <comma> and  she  turned  to  the  audience  and  described  herself  as  the  fair  demoiselle  with  her  red  hair  and  her  light  steps  and  so  forth <comma> and  then  she  said <comma> and  then  puberty  hit <period> and  she  began  to  talk  about  things  that  had  happened  to  her  body  and  her  face <comma> and  how  she  could  no  longer  count  on  her  beauty <comma> and  her  family  then  treated  her  like  the  ugly  sister  of  the  beautiful  one  for  whom  all  the  ballet  lessons  were  given <period> and  she  had  to  go  along  just  to  be  with  her  sister  for  company <comma> and  in  that  process <comma> she  made  a  number  of  decisions <period> first  of  all <comma> was  that  dance <comma> even  though  it  had  n't  been  offered  to  her <comma> was  her  life <period> and  secondly <comma> she  had  better  be <comma> although  she  did  dance  for  a  while <comma> a  choreographer  because  then  her  looks  did  n't  matter <period> but  she  was  thrilled  to  get  that  out  as  a  real <comma> real  fact  in  her  life <period> it  was  an  amazing  privilege  to  do  this  series <period> there  were  other  moments  like  that <comma> very  few  moments  of  silence <period> the  key  point  was  empathy  because  everybody  in  their  lives  is  really  waiting  for  people  to  ask  them  questions <comma> so  that  they  can  be  truthful  about  who  they  are  and  how  they  became  what  they  are <comma> and  i  commend  that  to  you <comma> even  if  you  're  not  doing  interviews <period> just  be  that  way  with  your  friends  and  particularly  the  older  members  of  your  family <period> thank  you  very  much <period> my  travels  to  afghanistan  began  many <comma> many  years  ago  on  the  eastern  border  of  my  country <comma> my  homeland <comma> poland <period> i  was  walking  through  the  forests  of  my  grandmother  's  tales <period> a  land  where  every  field  hides  a  grave <comma> where  millions  of  people  have  been  deported  or  killed  in  the  20th  century <period> behind  the  destruction <comma> i  found  a  soul  of  places <period> i  met  humble  people <period> i  heard  their  prayer  and  ate  their  bread <period> then  i  have  been  walking  east  for  20  years <comma> from  eastern  europe  to  central  asia <comma> through  the  caucasus  mountains <comma> middle  east <comma> north  africa <comma> russia <period> and  i  ever  met  more  humble  people <period> and  i  shared  their  bread  and  their  prayer <period> this  is  why  i  went  to  afghanistan <period> one  day <comma> i  crossed  the  bridge  over  the  oxus  river <period> i  was  alone  on  foot <period> and  the  afghan  soldier  was  so  surprised  to  see  me  that  he  forgot  to  stamp  my  passport <period> but  he  gave  me  a  cup  of  tea <period> and  i  understood  that  his  surprise  was  my  protection <period> so  i  have  been  walking  and  traveling <comma> by  horses <comma> by  yak <comma> by  truck <comma> by  hitchhiking <comma> from  iran  's  border  to  the  bottom <comma> to  the  edge  of  the  wakhan  corridor <period> and  in  this  way  i  could  find  noor <comma> the  hidden  light  of  afghanistan <period> my  only  weapon  was  my  notebook  and  my  leica <period> i  heard  prayers  of  the  sufi <comma> humble  muslims <comma> hated  by  the  taliban <period> hidden  river <comma> interconnected  with  the  mysticism  from  gibraltar  to  india <period> the  mosque  where  the  respectful  foreigner  is  showered  with  blessings  and  with  tears <comma> and  welcomed  as  a  gift <period> what  do  we  know  about  the  country  and  the  people  that  we  pretend  to  protect <comma> about  the  villages  where  the  only  one  medicine  to  kill  the  pain  and  to  stop  the  hunger  is  opium <questionmark> these  are  opium-addicted  people  on  the  roofs  of  kabul  10  years  after  the  beginning  of  our  war <period> these  are  the  nomad  girls  who  became  prostitutes  for  afghan  businessmen <period> what  do  we  know  about  the  women  10  years  after  the  war <questionmark> clothed  in  this  nylon  bag <comma> made  in  china <comma> with  the  name  of  burqa <period> i  saw  one  day <comma> the  largest  school  in  afghanistan <comma> a  girls  school <period> 13,000  girls  studying  here  in  the  rooms  underground <comma> full  of  scorpions <period> and  their  love  for  studying  was  so  big  that  i  cried <period> what  do  we  know  about  the  death  threats  by  the  taliban  nailed  on  the  doors  of  the  people  who  dare  to  send  their  daughters  to  school  as  in  balkh <questionmark> the  region  is  not  secure <comma> but  full  of  the  taliban <comma> and  they  did  it <period> my  aim  is  to  give  a  voice  to  the  silent  people <comma> to  show  the  hidden  lights  behind  the  curtain  of  the  great  game <comma> the  small  worlds  ignored  by  the  media  and  the  prophets  of  a  global  conflict <period> thanks <period> i  do  n't  know  what  the  hell  i  'm  doing  here <period> i  was  born  in  a  scots  presbyterian  ghetto  in  canada <comma> and  dropped  out  of  high  school <period> i  do  n't  own  a  cell  phone <comma> and  i  paint  on  paper  using  gouache <comma> which  has  n't  changed  in  600  years <period> but  about  three  years  ago  i  had  an  art  show  in  new  york <comma> and  i  titled  it  serious  nonsense <period> so  i  think  i  'm  actually  the  first  one  here <comma> i  lead <period> i  called  it  serious  nonsense  because  on  the  serious  side <comma> i  use  a  technique  of  painstaking  realism  of  editorial  illustration  from  when  i  was  a  kid <period> i  copied  it  and  i  never  unlearned  it <comma> it  's  the  only  style  i  know <period> and  it  's  very  kind  of  staid  and  formal <period> and  meanwhile <comma> i  use  nonsense <comma> as  you  can  see <period> this  is  a  scottish  castle  where  people  are  playing  golf  indoors <comma> and  the  trick  was  to  bang  the  golf  ball  off  of  suits  of  armor <comma> which  you  cannot  see  there <period> this  was  one  of  a  series  called  zany  afternoons <comma> which  became  a  book <period> this  is  a  home-built  rocket-propelled  car <period> that  's  a  1953  henry  j <comma> i  'm  a  bug  for  authenticity <comma> in  a  quiet  neighborhood  in  toledo <period> this  is  my  submission  for  the  la <period> museum  of  film <period> you  can  probably  tell  frank  gehry  and  i  come  from  the  same  town <period> my  work  is  so  personal  and  so  strange  that  i  have  to  invent  my  own  lexicon  for  it <period> and  i  work  a  lot  in  what  i  call  retrofuturism <comma> which  is  looking  back  to  see  how  yesterday  viewed  tomorrow <period> and  they  're  always  wrong <comma> always  hilariously <comma> optimistically  wrong <period> and  the  peak  time  for  that  was  the  30s <comma> because  the  depression  was  so  dismal  that  anything  to  get  away  from  the  present  into  the  future <period> and  technology  was  going  to  carry  us  along <period> this  is  popular  workbench <period> popular  science  magazines  in  those  days <comma> i  had  a  huge  collection  of  them  from  the  30s <comma> all  they  are  is  just  poor  people  being  asked  to  make  sunglasses  out  of  wire  coat  hangers  and  everything  improvised  and  dreaming  about  these  wonderful  giant  radio  robots  playing  ice  hockey  at  300  miles  an  hour <comma> it  's  all  going  to  happen <comma> it  's  all  going  to  be  wonderful <period> automotive  retrofuturism  is  one  of  my  specialties <period> i  was  both  an  automobile  illustrator  and  an  advertising  automobile  copywriter <comma> so  i  have  a  lot  of  revenge  to  take  on  the  subject <period> detroit  has  always  been  halfway  into  the  future <comma> the  advertising  half <period> this  is  the  58  bulgemobile <comma> so  new <comma> they  make  tomorrow  look  like  yesterday <period> this  is  a  chain  gang  of  guys  admiring  the  car <period> that  's  from  a  whole  catalog <comma> it  's  18  pages  or  so <comma> ran  back  in  the  days  of  the  lampoon <comma> where  i  cut  my  teeth <period> techno-archaeology  is  digging  back  and  finding  past  miracles  that  never  happened <comma> for  good  reason <comma> usually <period> the  zeppelin <comma> this  was  from  a  brochure  about  the  zeppelin  based <comma> obviously <comma> on  the  hindenburg <period> but  the  zeppelin  was  the  biggest  thing  that  ever  moved  made  by  man <period> and  it  carried  56  people  at  the  speed  of  a  buick  at  an  altitude  you  could  hear  dogs  bark <comma> and  it  cost  twice  as  much  as  a  first-class  cabin  on  the  normandie  to  fly  it <period> so  the  hindenburg  was  n't <comma> you  know <comma> it  was  inevitable  it  was  going  to  go <period> this  is  auto-gyro  jousting  in  malibu  in  the  30s <period> the  auto-gyro  could  n't  wait  for  the  invention  of  the  helicopter <comma> but  it  should  have <comma> it  was  n't  a  big  success <period> it  's  the  only  spanish  innovation <comma> technologically <comma> of  the  20th  century <comma> by  the  way <period> you  needed  to  know  that <period> the  flying  car  which  never  got  off  the  ground <comma> it  was  a  post-war  dream <period> my  old  man  used  to  tell  me  we  were  going  to  get  a  flying  car <period> this  is  pitched  into  the  future  from  1946 <comma> looking  at  the  day  all  american  families  have  them <period> there  's  moscow <comma> shirley <period> hope  they  speak  esperanto <period> faux-nostalgia <comma> which  i  'm  sort  of <comma> not <comma> say <comma> famous  for <comma> but  i  work  an  awful  lot  in  it <period> it  's  the  achingly  sentimental  yearning  for  times  that  never  happened <period> somebody  once  said  that  nostalgia  is  the  one  utterly  most  useless  human  emotion <comma> so  i  think  that's  a  case  for  serious  play <period> this  is  emblematic  of  it <comma> this  is  wing  dining <comma> recalling  those  balmy  summer  days  somewhere  over  france  in  the  20s <comma> dining  on  the  wing  of  a  plane <period> you  cannot  see  it  very  well  here <comma> but  that  's  hemingway  reading  some  pages  from  his  new  novel  to  fitzgerald  and  ford  madox  ford  until  the  slipstream  blows  him  away <period> this  is  tank  polo  in  the  south  hamptons <period> the  brainless  rich  are  more  fun  to  make  fun  of  than  anybody <period> i  do  a  lot  of  that <period> and  authenticity  is  a  major  part  of  my  serious  nonsense <period> i  think  it  adds  a  huge  amount <period> those <comma> for  example <comma> are  mark  iv  british  tanks  from  1916 <period> they  had  two  machine  guns  and  a  cannon <comma> and  they  had  90  horsepower  ricardo  engines <period> they  went  five  miles  an  hour  and  inside  it  was  105  degrees  in  the  pitch  dark <period> and  they  had  a  canary  hung  inside  the  thing  to  make  sure  the  germans  were  n't  going  to  use  gas <period> happy  little  story <comma> is  n't  it <questionmark> this  is  motor  ritz  towers  in  manhattan  in  the  30s <comma> where  you  drove  up  to  your  front  door <comma> if  you  had  the  guts <period> anybody  who  was  anybody  had  an  apartment  there <period> i  managed  to  stick  in  both  the  zeppelin  and  an  ocean  liner  out  of  sheer  enthusiasm <period> and  i  love  cigars <comma> there  's  a  cigar  billboard  down  there <period> and  faux-nostalgia  works  even  in  serious  subjects  like  war <period> this  is  those  wonderful  days  of  the  battle  of  britain  in  1940 <comma> when  a  messerschmitt  me109  bursts  into  the  house  of  commons  and  buzzes  around <comma> just  to  piss  off  churchill <comma> who  's  down  there  somewhere <period> it  's  a  fond  memory  of  times  past <period> hyperbolic  overkill  is  a  way  of  taking  exaggeration  to  the  absolute  ultimate  limit <comma> just  for  the  fun  of  it <period> this  was  a  piece  i  did <comma> a  brochure  again <comma> rms  tyrannic <comma> the  biggest  thing  in  all  the  world <period> the  copy <comma> which  you  cannot  see  because  it  goes  on  and  on  for  several  pages <comma> says  that  steerage  passengers  cannot  get  their  to  bunks  before  the  voyage  is  over <comma> and  it  's  so  safe  it  carries  no  insurance <period> it  's  obviously  modeled  on  the  titanic <period> but  it  's  not  a  cri  de  coeur  about  man  's  hubris  in  the  face  of  the  elements <period> it  's  just  a  sick <comma> silly  joke <period> shamelessly  cheap  is  something <comma> i  think <comma> this  will  wake  you  up <period> it  has  no  meaning <comma> just <comma> desoto  discovers  the  mississippi <comma> and  it  's  a  desoto  discovering  the  mississippi <period> i  did  that  as  a  quick  back  page <comma> i  had  like  four  hours  to  do  a  back  page  for  an  issue  of  the  lampoon <comma> and  i  did  that <comma> and  i  thought <comma> well <comma> i  'm  ashamed <period> i  hope  nobody  knows  it <period> people  wrote  in  for  reprints  of  that  thing <period> urban  absurdism <comma> that  's  what  the  new  yorker  really  calls  for <period> i  try  to  make  life  in  new  york  look  even  weirder  than  it  is  with  those  covers <period> i've  done  about  40  of  them <comma> and  i'd  say  30  of  them  are  based  on  that  concept <period> i  was  driving  down  7th  avenue  one  night  at  3  am <comma> and  this  steam  pouring  out  of  the  street <comma> and  i  thought <comma> what  causes  that  and  that <comma> who's  to  say <questionmark> the  temple  of  dendur  at  the  metropolitan  in  new  york <comma> it  's  a  very  somber  place <period> i  thought  i  could  jazz  it  up  a  bit <comma> have  a  little  fun  with  it <period> this  is  a  very  un-pc  cover <period> not  in  new  york <period> i  could  n't  resist <comma> and  i  got  a  nasty  email  from  some  environmental  group  saying <comma> this  is  too  serious  and  solemn  to  make  fun  of <period> you  should  be  ashamed <comma> please  apologize  on  our  website <period> have  n't  got  around  to  it  yet  but <comma> i  may <period> this  is  the  word  side  of  my  brain <period> i  love  the  word  eurotrash <period> that  's  all  the  eurotrash  coming  through  jfk  customs <period> this  was  the  new  york  bike  messenger  meeting  the  tour  de  france <period> if  you  live  in  new  york <comma> you  know  how  the  bike  messengers  move <period> except  that  he  's  carrying  a  tube  for  blueprints  and  stuff <comma> they  all  do <comma> and  a  lot  of  people  thought  that  meant  it  was  a  terrorist  about  to  shoot  rockets  at  the  tour  de  france <comma> sign  of  our  times <comma> i  guess <period> this  is  the  only  fashion  cover  i've  ever  done <period> it  's  the  little  old  lady  that  lives  in  a  shoe <comma> and  then  this  thing <comma> the  title  of  that  was <comma> there  goes  the  neighborhood <period> i  do  n't  know  a  hell  of  a  lot  about  fashion <comma> i  was  told  to  do  what  they  call  a  mary  jane <comma> and  then  i  got  into  this  terrible  fight  between  the  art  director  and  the  editor  saying <comma> put  a  strap  on  it <comma> no <comma> do  n't  put  a  strap  on  it <comma> put  a  strap  on  it <comma> do  n't  put  a  strap  on  it <comma> because  it  obscures  the  logo  and  looks  terrible  and  it  's  bad  and <comma> i  finally  chickened  out  and  did  it  for  the  sake  of  the  authenticity  of  the  shoe <period> this  is  a  tiny  joke <comma> e-zr  pass <period> one  letter  makes  an  idea <period> this  is  a  big  joke <period> this  is  the  audition  for  king  kong <period> people  always  ask  me <comma> where  do  you  get  your  ideas <comma> how  do  your  ideas  come <questionmark> truth  about  that  one  is  i  had  a  horrible  red  wine  hangover <comma> in  the  middle  of  the  night <comma> this  came  to  me  like  a  xerox <comma> all  i  had  to  do  was  write  it  down <period> it  was  perfectly  clear <period> i  did  n't  do  any  thinking  about  it <period> and  then  when  it  ran <comma> a  lovely  lady <comma> an  old  lady  named  mr.s  edgar  rosenberg <comma> if  you  know  that  name <comma> called  me  and  said  she  loved  the  cover <comma> it  was  so  sweet <period> her  former  name  was  fay  wray <comma> and  so  that  was <comma> i  did  n't  have  the  wit  to  say <comma> take  the  painting <period> finally <comma> this  was  a  three-page  cover <comma> never  done  before <comma> and  i  do  n't  think  it  will  ever  be  done  again <comma> successive  pages  in  the  front  of  the  magazine <period> it  's  the  ascent  of  man  using  an  escalator <comma> and  it  's  in  three  parts <period> you  cannot  see  it  all  together <comma> unfortunately <comma> but  if  you  look  at  it  enough <comma> you  can  sort  of  start  to  see  how  it  actually  starts  to  move <period> pretty  elegant <period> nothing  like  a  crash  to  end  a  joke <period> that  completes  my  oeuvre <period> i  would  just  like  to  add  a  crass  commercial  -- <period> i  have  a  kids  book  coming  out  in  the  fall  called  marvel  sandwiches <comma> a  compendium  of  all  the  serious  play  that  ever  was <comma> and  it's  going  to  be  available  in  fine  bookstores <comma> crummy  bookstores <comma> tables  on  the  street  in  october <period> so  thank  you  very  much <period> the  recent  debate  over  copyright  laws  like  sopa  in  the  united  states  and  the  acta  agreement  in  europe  has  been  very  emotional <period> and  i  think  some  dispassionate <comma> quantitative  reasoning  could  really  bring  a  great  deal  to  the  debate <period> i'd  therefore  like  to  propose  that  we  employ <comma> we  enlist <comma> the  cutting  edge  field  of  copyright  math  whenever  we  approach  this  subject <period> for  instance <comma> just  recently  the  motion  picture  association  revealed  that  our  economy  loses  58  billion  dollars  a  year  to  copyright  theft <period> now  rather  than  just  argue  about  this  number <comma> a  copyright  mathematician  will  analyze  it  and  he  'll  soon  discover  that  this  money  could  stretch  from  this  auditorium  all  the  way  across  ocean  boulevard  to  the  westin <comma> and  then  to  mars <period> if  we  use  pennies <period> now  this  is  obviously  a  powerful <comma> some  might  say  dangerously  powerful <comma> insight <period> but  it  's  also  a  morally  important  one <period> because  this  is  n't  just  the  hypothetical  retail  value  of  some  pirated  movies  that  we  're  talking  about <comma> but  this  is  actual  economic  losses <period> this  is  the  equivalent  to  the  entire  american  corn  crop  failing  along  with  all  of  our  fruit  crops <comma> as  well  as  wheat <comma> tobacco <comma> rice <comma> sorghum <comma> whatever  sorghum  is <comma> losing  sorghum <period> but  identifying  the  actual  losses  to  the  economy  is  almost  impossible  to  do  unless  we  use  copyright  math <period> now  music  revenues  are  down  by  about  eight  billion  dollars  a  year  since  napster  first  came  on  the  scene <period> so  that  's  a  chunk  of  what  we  're  looking  for <period> but  total  movie  revenues  across  theaters <comma> home  video  and  pay-per-view  are  up <period> and  tv <comma> satellite  and  cable  revenues  are  way  up <period> other  content  markets  like  book  publishing  and  radio  are  also  up <period> so  this  small  missing  chunk  here  is  puzzling <period> since  the  big  content  markets  have  grown  in  line  with  historic  norms <comma> it  's  not  additional  growth  that  piracy  has  prevented <comma> but  copyright  math  tells  us  it  must  therefore  be  foregone  growth  in  a  market  that  has  no  historic  norms <comma> one  that  did  n't  exist  in  the  90  's <period> what  we  're  looking  at  here  is  the  insidious  cost  of  ringtone  piracy <period> 50  billion  dollars  of  it  a  year <comma> which  is  enough <comma> at  30  seconds  a  ringtone <comma> that  could  stretch  from  here  to  neanderthal  times <period> it  's  true <period> i  have  excel <period> the  movie  folks  also  tell  us  that  our  economy  loses  over  370,000  jobs  to  content  theft <comma> which  is  quite  a  lot  when  you  consider  that <comma> back  in  98 <comma> the  bureau  of  labor  statistics  indicated  that  the  motion  picture  and  video  industries  were  employing  270,000  people <period> other  data  has  the  music  industry  at  about  45,000  people <period> and  so  the  job  losses  that  came  with  the  internet  and  all  that  content  theft <comma> have  therefore  left  us  with  negative  employment  in  our  content  industries <period> and  this  is  just  one  of  the  many  mind-blowing  statistics  that  copyright  mathematicians  have  to  deal  with  every  day <period> and  some  people  think  that  string  theory  is  tough <period> now  this  is  a  key  number  from  the  copyright  mathematicians  toolkit <period> it  's  the  precise  amount  of  harm  that  comes  to  media  companies  whenever  a  single  copyrighted  song  or  movie  gets  pirated <period> hollywood  and  congress  derived  this  number  mathematically <period> back  when  they  last  sat  down  to  improve  copyright  damages  and  made  this  law <period> some  people  think  this  number  's  a  little  bit  large <comma> but  copyright  mathematicians  who  are  media  lobby  experts  are  merely  surprised  that  it  does  n't  get  compounded  for  inflation  every  year <period> now  when  this  law  first  passed <comma> the  world  's  hottest  mp3  player  could  hold  just  10  songs <period> and  it  was  a  big  christmas  hit <period> because  what  little  hoodlum  would  n't  want  a  million  and  a  half  bucks-worth  of  stolen  goods  in  his  pocket <period> these  days  an  ipod  classic  can  hold  40,000  songs <comma> which  is  to  say  eight  billion  dollars-worth  of  stolen  media <period> or  about  75,000  jobs <period> now  you  might  find  copyright  math  strange <comma> but  that  's  because  it  's  a  field  that  's  best  left  to  experts <period> i  hope  you  'll  join  me  next  time  when  i  will  be  making  an  equally  scientific  and  fact-based  inquiry  into  the  cost  of  alien  music  piracy  to  he  american  economy <period> thank  you  very  much <period> thank  you <period> this  is  very  strange  for  me <comma> because  i'm  not  used  to  doing  this: <period> i  usually  stand  on  the  other  side  of  the  light <comma> and  now  i  'm  feeling  the  pressure  i  put  other  people  into <period> and  it  's  hard <period> the  previous  speaker  has <comma> i  think <comma> really  painted  a  very  good  background  as  to  the  impulse  behind  my  work  and  what  drives  me <comma> and  my  sense  of  loss <comma> and  trying  to  find  the  answer  to  the  big  questions <period> but  this <comma> for  me <comma> i  mean <comma> coming  here  to  do  this <comma> feels  like <comma> there's  this  sculptor  that  i  like  very  much <comma> giacometti <comma> who  after  many  years  of  living  in  france <comma> and  learning <comma> you  know <comma> studying  and  working <comma> he  returned  home  and  he  was  asked <comma> what  did  you  produce <questionmark> what  have  you  done  with  so  many  years  of  being  away <questionmark> and  he  sort  of <comma> he  showed  a  handful  of  figurines <period> and  obviously  they  were <comma> is  this  what  you  spent  years  doing <questionmark> and  we  expected  huge  masterpieces <period> but  what  struck  me  is  the  understanding  that  in  those  little  pieces  was  the  culmination  of  a  man's  life <comma> search <comma> thought <comma> everything  -- <period> just  in  a  reduced <comma> small  version <period> in  a  way <comma> i  feel  like  that <period> i  feel  like  i'm  coming  home  to  talk  about  what  i've  been  away  doing  for  20  years <period> and  i  will  start  with  a  brief  taster  of  what  i've  been  about: <period> a  handful  of  films <comma> nothing  much <comma> two  feature  films  and  a  handful  of  short  films <period> so <comma> we'll  go  with  the  first  piece <period> court <comma> sleep <period> court <comma> where <questionmark> woman <comma> nigeria <period> court <comma> never <period> couldn't  afford  it <period> boy <comma> what  do  you  do  all  day

right <questionmark> woman  1 <comma> yes <period> let's  go <period> w1 <comma> they  suck <period> dr.eam  about  bullshit <period> newton  aduaka <comma> thank  you <period> the  first  clip <comma> really <comma> is  totally  trying  to  capture  what  cinema  is  for  me <comma> and  where  i  'm  coming  from  in  terms  of  cinema <period> the  first  piece  was <comma> really <comma> there  's  a  young  woman  talking  about  nigeria <comma> that  she  has  a  feeling  she  'll  be  happy  there <period> these  are  the  sentiments  of  someone  that  's  been  away  from  home <period> and  that  was  something  that  i  went  through <comma> you  know <comma> and  i  'm  still  going  through <period> i've  not  been  home  for  quite  a  while <comma> for  about  five  years  now <period> i've  been  away  20  years  in  total <period> and  so  it's  really <comma> it  's  really  how  suddenly <comma> you  know <comma> this  was  made  in  1997 <comma> which  is  the  time  of  abacha <comma> the  military  dictatorship <comma> the  worst  part  of  nigerian  history <comma> this  post-colonial  history <period> so <comma> for  this  girl  to  have  these  dreams  is  simply  how  we  preserve  a  sense  of  what  home  is <period> how <comma> and  it  's  sort  of <comma> perhaps  romantic <comma> but  i  think  beautiful <comma> because  you  just  need  something  to  hold  on  to <comma> especially  in  a  society  where  you  feel  alienated <period> which  takes  us  to  the  next  piece <comma> where  the  young  man  talks  about  lack  of  opportunity <comma> living  as  a  black  person  in  europe <period> the  glass  ceiling  that  we  all  know  about <comma> that  we  all  talk  about <period> and  his  reality <period> again <comma> this  was  my <comma> this  was  me  talking  about <comma> this  was <comma> again <comma> the  time  of  multiculturalism  in  the  united  kingdom <comma> and  there  was  this  buzzword <comma> and  it  was  trying  to  say <comma> what  exactly  does  this  multiculturalism  mean  in  the  real  lives  of  people <questionmark> and  what  would  a  child <comma> what  does  a  child  like  jamie <comma> the  young  boy <comma> think <comma> i  mean <comma> with  all  this  anger  that  's  built  up  inside  of  him <questionmark> what  happens  with  that <questionmark> what <comma> of  course <comma> happens  with  that  is  violence <comma> which  we  see  when  we  talk  about  the  ghettos  and  we  talk  about <comma> you  know <comma> south  central  la <period> and  this  kind  of  stuff <period> and  which  eventually <comma> when  channeled <comma> becomes <comma> you  know <comma> evolves  and  manifests  itself  as  riots <comma> like  the  one  in  france  two  years  ago <comma> where  i  live <comma> which  shocked  everybody <comma> because  everyone  thought <comma> oh  well <comma> france  is  a  liberal  society <period> but  i  lived  in  england  for  18  years <period> i've  lived  in  france  for  about  four <comma> and  i  feel  actually  thrown  back  20  years <comma> living  in  france <period> and  then <comma> the  third  piece <period> the  third  piece  for  me  is  the  question <comma> what  is  cinema  to  you <questionmark> what  do  you  do  with  cinema <questionmark> there  's  a  young  director <comma> hollywood  director <comma> with  his  friends <comma> fellow  filmmakers <comma> talking  about  what  cinema  means <period> i  suppose  that  will  take  me  to  my  last  piece <comma> what  cinema  means  for  me <period> my  life  started  as  a <comma> i  started  life  in  1966 <comma> a  few  months  before  the  biafran <comma> which  lasted  for  three  years  and  it  was  three  years  of  war <period> so  that  whole  thing <comma> that  whole  childhood  echoes  and  takes  me  into  the  next  piece <period> voice <comma> onicha <comma> off  to  school  with  your  brother <period> onicha <comma> yes <comma> mama <period> commander <comma> soldiers <comma> you  are  going  to  fight  a  battle <comma> so  you  must  get  ready  and  willing  to  die <period> you  must  get

the  barrel  of  the  gun <period> c <comma> this  is  the  gun <period> cs <comma> this  is  the  gun <period> c <comma> this  is  an  ak-47  rifle <period> this  is  your  life <period> this  is

go  a  long  way  towards  understanding  the  causes  of  the  rebel  war <period> more  than  that <comma> begin  a  healing  process  and  finally  to <comma> as  an  act  of  closure  to  a  terrible  period  in  this  country's  history <period> the  beginning  of  hope <period> mr.  ezra  gelehun <comma> please  stand <period> state  your  name  and  age  for  the  commission <period> ezra <comma> my  name  is  ezra  gelehun <period> i  am  15  or  16 <period> i  don't  remember <period> ask  my  sister <comma> she  is  the  witch <comma> she  knows  everything <period> cc <comma> mr.  gelehun <comma> i'd  like  to  remind  you  you're  not  on  trial  here  for  any  crimes  you  committed <period> e <comma> we  were  fighting  for  our  freedom <period> if  killing  in  a  war  is  a  crime <comma> then  you  have  to  charge  every  soldier  in  the  world <period> war  is  a  crime <comma> yes <comma> but  i  did  not  start  it <period> you  too  are  a  retired  general <comma> not  so <questionmark> cc <comma> yes <comma> correct <period> e <comma> so  you  too  must  stand  trial  then <period> our  government  was  corrupt <period> lack  of  education  was  their  way  to  control  power <period> if  i  may  ask <comma> do  you  pay  for  school  in  your  country <questionmark> e <comma> you  are  richer  than  us <period> but  we  pay  for  school <period> your  country  talks  about  democracy <period> but  you  support  corrupt  governments  like  my  own <period> why <questionmark> because  you  want  our  diamond <period> ask  if  anyone  in  this  room  have  ever  seen  real  diamond  before <questionmark> no <period> cc <comma> mr.  gelehun <comma> i'd  like  to  remind  you <comma> you  're  not  on  trial  here  today <period> you  are  not  on  trial <period> e <comma> then  let  me  go <period> cc <comma> i  cannot  do  that <comma> son <period> e <comma> so  you  are  a  liar <period> na <comma> thank  you <period> just  very  quickly  to  say  that  my  point  really  here <comma> is  that  while  we're  making  all  these  huge  advancements <comma> what  we  're  doing <comma> which  for  me <comma> you  know <comma> i  think  we  should <comma> africa  should  move  forward <comma> but  we  should  remember <comma> so  we  do  not  go  back  here  again <period> thank  you <period> emeka  okafor <comma> thank  you <comma> newton <period> one  of  the  themes  that  comes  through  very  strongly  in  the  piece  we  just  watched  is  this  sense  of  the  psychological  trauma  of  the  young  that  have  to  play  this  role  of  being  child  soldiers <period> and  considering  where  you  are  coming  from <comma> and  when  we  consider  the  extent  to  which  it's  not  taken  as  seriously  as  it  should  be <comma> what  would  you  have  to  say  about  that <questionmark> na <comma> in  the  process  of  my  research <comma> i  actually  spent  a  bit  of  time  in  sierra  leone  researching  this <period> and  i  remember  i  met  a  lot  of  child  soldiers <comma> ex-combatants <comma> as  they  like  to  be  called <period> i  met  psychosocial  workers  who  worked  with  them <period> i  met  psychiatrists  who  spent  time  with  them <comma> aid  workers <comma> ngos <comma> the  whole  lot <period> but  i  remember  on  the  flight  back  on  my  last  trip <comma> i  remember  breaking  down  in  tears  and  thinking  to  myself <comma> if  any  kid  in  the  west <comma> in  the  western  world <comma> went  through  a  day  of  what  any  of  those  kids  have  gone  through <comma> they  will  be  in  therapy  for  the  rest  of  their  natural  lives <period> so  for  me <comma> the  thought  that  we  have  all  these  children <comma> it's  a  generation <comma> we  have  a  whole  generation  of  children <comma> who  have  been  put  through  so  much  psychological  trauma  or  damage <period> and  africa  has  to  live  with  that <period> but  i'm  just  saying  to  factor  that  in <comma> factor  that  in  with  all  this  great  advancement <comma> all  this  pronouncement  of  great  achievement <period> that's  really  my  thinking <period> eo <comma> well <comma> we  thank  you  again  for  coming  to  the  ted  stage <period> that  was  a  very  moving  piece <period> na <comma> thank  you <period> eo <comma> thank  you <period> martin  luther  king  did  not  say <comma> i  have  a  nightmare <comma> when  he  inspired  the  civil  rights  movements <period> he  said <comma> i  have  a  dream <period> and  i  have  a  dream <period> i  have  a  dream  that  we  can  stop  thinking  that  the  future  will  be  a  nightmare <comma> and  this  is  going  to  be  a  challenge <comma> because <comma> if  you  think  of  every  major  blockbusting  film  of  recent  times <comma> nearly  all  of  its  visions  for  humanity  are  apocalyptic <period> i  think  this  film  is  one  of  the  hardest  watches  of  modern  times <comma> the  road <period> it  's  a  beautiful  piece  of  filmmaking <comma> but  everything  is  desolate <comma> everything  is  dead <period> and  just  a  father  and  son  trying  to  survive <comma> walking  along  the  road <period> and  i  think  the  environmental  movement  of  which  i  am  a  part  of  has  been  complicit  in  creating  this  vision  of  the  future <period> for  too  long <comma> we  have  peddled  a  nightmarish  vision  of  what  's  going  to  happen <period> we  have  focused  on  the  worst-case  scenario <period> we  have  focused  on  the  problems <period> and  we  have  not  thought  enough  about  the  solutions <period> we've  used  fear <comma> if  you  like <comma> to  grab  people  's  attention <period> and  any  psychologist  will  tell  you  that  fear  in  the  organism  is  linked  to  flight  mechanism <period> it  's  part  of  the  fight  and  flight  mechanism <comma> that  when  an  animal  is  frightened <comma> think  of  a  deer <period> a  deer  freezes  very <comma> very  still <comma> poised  to  run  away <period> and  i  think  that  's  what  we  're  doing  when  we  're  asking  people  to  engage  with  our  agenda  around  environmental  degradation  and  climate  change <period> people  are  freezing  and  running  away  because  we  're  using  fear <period> and  i  think  the  environmental  movement  has  to  grow  up  and  start  to  think  about  what  progress  is <period> what  would  it  be  like  to  be  improving  the  human  lot <questionmark> and  one  of  the  problems  that  we  face <comma> i  think <comma> is  that  the  only  people  that  have  cornered  the  market  in  terms  of  progress  is  a  financial  definition  of  what  progress  is <comma> an  economic  definition  of  what  progress  is <comma> that  somehow <comma> if  we  get  the  right  numbers  to  go  up <comma> we  're  going  to  be  better  off <comma> whether  that  's  on  the  stock  market <comma> whether  that  's  with  gdp  and  economic  growth <comma> that  somehow  life  is  going  to  get  better <period> this  is  somehow  appealing  to  human  greed  instead  of  fear <comma> that  more  is  better <period> come  on <period> in  the  western  world <comma> we  have  enough <period> maybe  some  parts  of  the  world  do  n't <comma> but  we  have  enough <period> and  we've  know  for  a  long  time  that  this  is  not  a  good  measure  of  the  welfare  of  nations <period> in  fact <comma> the  architect  of  our  national  accounting  system <comma> simon  kuznets <comma> in  the  1930s <comma> said  that <comma> a  nation  's  welfare  can  scarcely  be  inferred  from  their  national  income <period> but  we've  created  a  national  accounting  system  which  is  firmly  based  on  production  and  producing  stuff <period> and  indeed <comma> this  is  probably  historical <comma> and  it  had  its  time <period> in  the  second  world  war <comma> we  needed  to  produce  a  lot  of  stuff <period> and  indeed <comma> we  were  so  successful  at  producing  certain  types  of  stuff  that  we  destroyed  a  lot  of  europe <comma> and  we  had  to  rebuild  it  afterwards <period> and  so  our  national  accounting  system  became  fixated  on  what  we  can  produce <period> but  as  early  as  1968 <comma> this  visionary  man <comma> robert  kennedy <comma> at  the  start  of  his  ill-fated  presidential  campaign <comma> gave  the  most  eloquent  deconstruction  of  gross  national  product  that  ever  has  been <period> and  he  finished  his  talk  with  the  phrase <comma> that <comma> the  gross  national  product  measures  everything  except  that  which  makes  life  worthwhile <period> how  crazy  is  that <questionmark> that  our  measure  of  progress <comma> our  dominant  measure  of  progress  in  society <comma> is  measuring  everything  except  that  which  makes  life  worthwhile <questionmark> i  believe <comma> if  kennedy  was  alive  today <comma> he  would  be  asking  statisticians  such  as  myself  to  go  out  and  find  out  what  makes  life  worthwhile <period> he'd  be  asking  us  to  redesign  our  national  accounting  system  to  be  based  upon  such  important  things  as  social  justice <comma> sustainability  and  people  's  well-being <period> and  actually <comma> social  scientists  have  already  gone  out  and  asked  these  questions  around  the  world <period> this  is  from  a  global  survey <period> it  's  asking  people <comma> what  do  they  want <period> and  unsurprisingly <comma> people  all  around  the  world  say  that  what  they  want  is  happiness <comma> for  themselves <comma> for  their  families <comma> their  children <comma> their  communities <period> okay <comma> they  think  money  is  slightly  important <period> it  's  there <comma> but  it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  happiness <comma> and  it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  love <period> we  all  need  to  love  and  be  loved  in  life <period> it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  health <period> we  want  to  be  healthy  and  live  a  full  life <period> these  seem  to  be  natural  human  aspirations <period> why  are  statisticians  not  measuring  these <questionmark> why  are  we  not  thinking  of  the  progress  of  nations  in  these  terms <comma> instead  of  just  how  much  stuff  we  have <questionmark> and  really <comma> this  is  what  i've  done  with  my  adult  life <comma> is  think  about  how  do  we  measure  happiness <comma> how  do  we  measure  well-being <comma> how  can  we  do  that  within  environmental  limits <period> and  we  created <comma> at  the  organization  that  i  work  for <comma> the  new  economics  foundation <comma> something  we  call  the  happy  planet  index <comma> because  we  think  people  should  be  happy  and  the  planet  should  be  happy <period> why  do  n't  we  create  a  measure  of  progress  that  shows  that <questionmark> and  what  we  do <comma> is  we  say  that  the  ultimate  outcome  of  a  nation  is  how  successful  is  it  at  creating  happy  and  healthy  lives  for  its  citizens <period> that  should  be  the  goal  of  every  nation  on  the  planet <period> but  we  have  to  remember  that  there  's  a  fundamental  input  to  that <comma> and  that  is  how  many  of  the  planet  's  resources  we  use <period> we  all  have  one  planet <period> we  all  have  to  share  it <period> it  is  the  ultimate  scarce  resource <comma> the  one  planet  that  we  share <period> and  economics  is  very  interested  in  scarcity <period> when  it  has  a  scarce  resource  that  it  wants  to  turn  into  a  desirable  outcome <comma> it  thinks  in  terms  of  efficiency <period> it  thinks  in  terms  of  how  much  bang  do  we  get  for  our  buck <period> and  this  is  a  measure  of  how  much  well-being  we  get  for  our  planetary  resource  use <period> it  is  an  efficiency  measure <period> and  probably  the  easiest  way  to  show  you  that <comma> is  to  show  you  this  graph <period> running  horizontally  along  the  graph <comma> is  ecological  footprint <comma> which  is  a  measure  of  how  much  resources  we  use  and  how  much  pressure  we  put  on  the  planet <period> more  is  bad <period> running  vertically  upwards <comma> is  a  measure  called  happy  life  years  it  's  about  the  well-being  of  nations <period> it  's  like  a  happiness  adjusted  life-expectancy <period> it  's  like  quality  and  quantity  of  life  in  nations <period> and  the  yellow  dot  there  you  see <comma> is  the  global  average <period> now <comma> there  's  a  huge  array  of  nations  around  that  global  average <period> to  the  top  right  of  the  graph <comma> are  countries  which  are  doing  reasonably  well  and  producing  well-being <comma> but  they  're  using  a  lot  of  planet  to  get  there <period> they  are  the  usa <comma> other  western  countries  going  across  in  those  triangles  and  a  few  gulf  states  in  there  actually <period> conversely <comma> at  the  bottom  left  of  the  graph <comma> are  countries  that  are  not  producing  much  well-being <comma> typically <comma> sub-saharan  africa <period> in  hobbesian  terms <comma> life  is  short  and  brutish  there <period> the  average  life  expectancy  in  many  of  these  countries  is  only  40  years <period> malaria <comma> hiv/aids  are  killing  a  lot  of  people  in  these  regions  of  the  world <period> but  now  for  the  good  news <period> there  are  some  countries  up  there <comma> yellow  triangles <comma> that  are  doing  better  than  global  average <comma> that  are  heading  up  towards  the  top  left  of  the  graph <period> this  is  an  aspirational  graph <period> we  want  to  be  top  left <comma> where  good  lives  do  n't  cost  the  earth <period> they  're  latin  american <period> the  country  on  its  own  up  at  the  top  is  a  place  i  have  n't  been  to <period> maybe  some  of  you  have <period> costa  rica <period> costa  rica <comma> average  life  expectancy  is  78-and-a-half  years <period> that  is  longer  than  in  the  usa <period> they  are <comma> according  to  the  latest  gallup  world  poll <comma> the  happiest  nation  on  the  planet <comma> than  anybody <period> more  than  switzerland  and  denmark <period> they  are  the  happiest  place <period> they  are  doing  that  on  a  quarter  of  the  resources  that  are  used  typically  in  the  western  world <comma> a  quarter  of  the  resources <period> what  's  going  on  there <questionmark> what  's  happening  in  costa  rica <questionmark> we  can  look  at  some  of  the  data <period> 99  percent  of  their  electricity  comes  from  renewable  resources <period> their  government  is  one  of  the  first  to  commit  to  be  carbon  neutral  by  2021 <period> they  abolished  the  army  in  1949 <comma> 1949 <period> and  they  invested  in  social  programs <comma> health  and  education <period> they  have  one  of  the  highest  literacy  rates  in  latin  america  and  in  the  world <period> and  they  have  that  latin  vibe <comma> do  n't  they <period> they  have  the  social  connectedness <period> the  challenge  is <comma> that  possibly <comma> and  the  thing  we  might  have  to  think  about <comma> is  that  the  future  might  not  be  north  american <comma> might  not  be  western  european <period> it  might  be  latin  american <period> and  the  challenge <comma> really <comma> is  to  pull  the  global  average  up  here <period> that  's  what  we  need  to  do <period> and  if  we  're  going  to  do  that <comma> we  need  to  pull  countries  from  the  bottom <comma> and  we  need  to  pull  countries  from  the  right  of  the  graph <period> and  then  we  're  starting  to  create  a  happy  planet <period> that  's  one  way  of  looking  at  it <period> another  way  of  looking  at  it  is  looking  at  time  trends <period> we  do  n't  have  good  data  going  back  for  every  country  in  the  world <comma> but  for  some  of  the  richest  countries <comma> the  oecd  group <comma> we  do <period> and  this  is  the  trend  in  well-being  over  that  time <comma> a  small  increase <comma> but  this  is  the  trend  in  ecological  footprint <period> and  so  in  strict  happy-planet  methodology <comma> we've  become  less  efficient  at  turning  our  ultimate  scarce  resource  into  the  outcome  we  want  to <period> and  the  point  really  is <comma> is  that  i  think <comma> probably  everybody  in  this  room  would  like  society  to  get  to  2050  without  an  apocalyptic  something  happening <period> it  's  actually  not  very  long  away <period> it  's  half  a  human  lifetime  away <period> a  child  entering  school  today  will  be  my  age  in  2050 <period> this  is  not  the  very  distant  future <period> this  is  what  the  uk <period> government  target  on  carbon  and  greenhouse  emissions  looks  like <period> and  i  put  it  to  you <comma> that  is  not  business  as  usual <period> that  is  changing  our  business <period> that  is  changing  the  way  we  create  our  organizations <comma> we  do  our  government  policy  and  we  live  our  lives <period> and  the  point  is <comma> we  need  to  carry  on  increasing  well-being <period> no  one  can  go  to  the  polls  and  say  that  quality  of  life  is  going  to  reduce <period> none  of  us <comma> i  think <comma> want  human  progress  to  stop <period> i  think  we  want  it  to  carry  on <period> i  think  we  want  the  lot  of  humanity  to  keep  on  increasing <period> and  i  think  this  is  where  climate  change  skeptics  and  deniers  come  in <period> i  think  this  is  what  they  want <period> they  want  quality  of  life  to  keep  increasing <period> they  want  to  hold  on  to  what  they've  got <period> and  if  we  're  going  to  engage  them <comma> i  think  that  's  what  we've  got  to  do <period> and  that  means  we  have  to  really  increase  efficiency  even  more <period> now  that  's  all  very  easy  to  draw  graphs  and  things  like  that <comma> but  the  point  is  we  need  to  turn  those  curves <period> and  this  is  where  i  think  we  can  take  a  leaf  out  of  systems  theory <comma> systems  engineers <comma> where  they  create  feedback  loops <comma> put  the  right  information  at  the  right  point  of  time <period> human  beings  are  very  motivated  by  the  now <period> you  put  a  smart  meter  in  your  home <comma> and  you  see  how  much  electricity  you  're  using  right  now <comma> how  much  it  's  costing  you <comma> your  kids  go  around  and  turn  the  lights  off  pretty  quickly <period> what  would  that  look  like  for  society <questionmark> why  is  it <comma> on  the  radio  news  every  evening <comma> i  hear  the  ftse  100 <comma> the  dow  jones <comma> the  dollar  pound  ratio <comma> i  do  n't  even  know  which  way  the  dollar  pound  ratio  should  go  to  be  good  news <period> and  why  do  i  hear  that <questionmark> why  do  n't  i  hear  how  much  energy  britain  used  yesterday <comma> or  american  used  yesterday <questionmark> did  we  meet  our  three  percent  annual  target  on  reducing  carbon  emissions <questionmark> that  's  how  you  create  a  collective  goal <period> you  put  it  out  there  into  the  media  and  start  thinking  about  it <period> and  we  need  positive  feedback  loops  for  increasing  well-being <period> at  a  government  level <comma> they  might  create  national  accounts  of  well-being <period> at  a  business  level <comma> you  might  look  at  the  well-being  of  your  employees <comma> which  we  know  is  really  linked  to  creativity <comma> which  is  linked  to  innovation <comma> and  we  're  going  to  need  a  lot  of  innovation  to  deal  with  those  environmental  issues <period> at  a  personal  level <comma> we  need  these  nudges  too <period> maybe  we  do  n't  quite  need  the  data <comma> but  we  need  reminders <period> in  the  uk <comma> we  have  a  strong  public  health  message  on  five  fruit  and  vegetables  a  day  and  how  much  exercise  we  should  do <comma> never  my  best  thing <period> what  are  these  for  happiness <questionmark> what  are  the  five  things  that  you  should  do  every  day  to  be  happier <questionmark> we  did  a  project  for  the  government  office  of  science  a  couple  of  years  ago <comma> a  big  program  called  the  foresight  program <comma> lots  and  lots  of  people <comma> involved  lots  of  experts <comma> everything  evidence  based <comma> a  huge  tome <period> but  a  piece  of  work  we  did  was  on <comma> what  five  positive  actions  can  you  do  to  improve  well-being  in  your  life <questionmark> and  the  point  of  these  is  they  are <comma> not  quite <comma> the  secrets  of  happiness <comma> but  they  are  things  that  i  think  happiness  will  flow  out  the  side  from <period> and  the  first  of  these  is  to  connect <comma> is  that  your  social  relationships  are  the  most  important  cornerstones  of  your  life <period> do  you  invest  the  time  with  your  loved  ones  that  you  could  do <comma> and  energy <questionmark> keep  building  them <period> the  second  one  is  be  active <period> the  fastest  way  out  of  a  bad  mood <comma> step  outside <comma> go  for  a  walk <comma> turn  the  radio  on  and  dance <period> being  active  is  great  for  our  positive  mood <period> the  third  one  is  take  notice <period> how  aware  are  you  of  things  going  on  around  the  world <comma> the  seasons  changing <comma> people  around  you <questionmark> do  you  notice  what  's  bubbling  up  for  you  and  trying  to  emerge <questionmark> based  on  a  lot  of  evidence  for  mindfulness <comma> cognitive  behavioral  therapy <comma> very  strong  for  our  well  being <period> the  fourth  is  keep  learning  and  keep  is  important <comma> learning  throughout  the  whole  life  course <period> older  people  who  keep  learning  and  are  curious <comma> they  have  much  better  health  outcomes  than  those  who  start  to  close  down <period> but  it  does  n't  have  to  be  formal  learning <period> it  's  not  knowledge  based <period> it  's  more  curiosity <period> it  can  be  learning  to  cook  a  new  dish <comma> picking  up  an  instrument  you  forgot  as  a  child <period> keep  learning <period> and  the  final  one  is  that  most  anti-economic  of  activities <comma> but  give <period> our  generosity <comma> our  altruism <comma> our  compassion <comma> are  all  hardwired  to  the  reward  mechanism  in  our  brain <period> we  feel  good  if  we  give <period> you  can  do  an  experiment  where  you  give  two  groups  of  people  a  hundred  dollars  in  the  morning <period> you  tell  one  of  them  to  spend  it  on  themselves  and  one  on  other  people <period> you  measure  their  happiness  at  the  end  of  the  day <comma> those  that  have  gone  and  spent  on  other  people  are  much  happier  that  those  that  spent  it  on  themselves <period> and  these  five  ways <comma> which  we  put  onto  these  handy  postcards <comma> i  would  say <comma> do  n't  have  to  cost  the  earth <period> they  do  n't  have  any  carbon  content <period> they  do  n't  need  a  lot  of  material  goods  to  be  satisfied <period> and  so  i  think  it  's  really  quite  feasible  that  happiness  does  not  cost  the  earth <period> now <comma> martin  luther  king <comma> on  the  eve  of  his  death <comma> gave  an  incredible  speech <period> he  said <comma> i  know  there  are  challenges  ahead <comma> there  may  be  trouble  ahead <comma> but  i  fear  no  one <period> i  do  n't  care <period> i  have  been  to  the  mountain  top <comma> and  i  have  seen  the  promised  land <period> now <comma> he  was  a  preacher <comma> but  i  believe  the  environmental  movement  and <comma> in  fact <comma> the  business  community <comma> government <comma> needs  to  go  to  the  top  of  the  mountain  top <comma> and  it  needs  to  look  out <comma> and  it  needs  to  see  the  promised  land <comma> or  the  land  of  promise <comma> and  it  needs  to  have  a  vision  of  a  world  that  we  all  want <period> and  not  only  that <comma> we  need  to  create  a  great  transition  to  get  there <comma> and  we  need  to  pave  that  great  transition  with  good  things <period> human  beings  want  to  be  happy <period> pave  them  with  the  five  ways <period> and  we  need  to  have  signposts  gathering  people  together  and  pointing  them <comma> something  like  the  happy  planet  index <period> and  then  i  believe  that  we  can  all  create  a  world  we  all  want <comma> where  happiness  does  not  cost  the  earth <period> so  i  work  in  marketing <comma> which  i  love <comma> but  my  first  passion  was  physics <comma> a  passion  brought  to  me  by  a  wonderful  school  teacher <comma> when  i  had  a  little  less  gray  hair <period> so  he  taught  me  that  physics  is  cool  because  it  teaches  us  so  much  about  the  world  around  us <period> and  i  'm  going  to  spend  the  next  few  minutes  trying  to  convince  you  that  physics  can  teach  us  something  about  marketing <period> so  quick  show  of  hands <comma> who  studied  some  marketing  in  university <questionmark> who  studied  some  physics  in  university <questionmark> pretty  good <period> and  at  school <questionmark> okay <comma> lots  of  you <period> so <comma> hopefully  this  will  bring  back  some  happy <comma> or  possibly  some  slightly  disturbing  memories <period> so <comma> physics  and  marketing <period> we  'll  start  with  something  very  simple <comma> newton  's  law <comma> the  force  equals  mass  times  acceleration  this  is  something  that  perhaps  turkish  airlines  should  have  studied  a  bit  more  carefully  before  they  ran  this  campaign <period> but  if  we  rearrange  this  formula  quickly <comma> we  can  get  to  acceleration  equals  force  over  mass <comma> which  means  that  for  a  larger  particle <comma> a  larger  mass <comma> it  requires  more  force  to  change  its  direction <period> it  's  the  same  with  brands: <period> the  more  massive  a  brand <comma> the  more  baggage  it  has <comma> the  more  force  is  needed  to  change  its  positioning <period> and  that  's  one  of  the  reasons  why  arthur  andersen  chose  to  launch  accenture  rather  than  try  to  persuade  the  world  that  andersen  's  could  stand  for  something  other  than  accountancy <period> it  explains  why  hoover  found  it  very  difficult  to  persuade  the  world  that  it  was  more  than  vacuum  cleaners <comma> and  why  companies  like  unilever  and  p&ampg  keep  brands  separate <comma> like  ariel  and  pringles  and  dove  rather  than  having  one  giant  parent  brand <period> so  the  physics  is  that  the  bigger  the  mass  of  an  object  the  more  force  is  needed  to  change  its  direction <period> the  marketing  is <comma> the  bigger  a  brand <comma> the  more  difficult  it  is  to  reposition  it <period> so  think  about  a  portfolio  of  brands  or  maybe  new  brands  for  new  ventures <period> now <comma> who  remembers  heisenberg  's  uncertainty  principle <questionmark> getting  a  little  more  technical  now <period> so  this  says  that  it  's  impossible <comma> by  definition <comma> to  measure  exactly  the  state <comma> ie <comma> the  position <comma> and  the  momentum  of  a  particle <comma> because  the  act  of  measuring  it <comma> by  definition <comma> changes  it <period> so  to  explain  that <comma> if  you've  got  an  elementary  particle  and  you  shine  a  light  on  it <comma> then  the  photon  of  light  has  momentum <comma> which  knocks  the  particle <comma> so  you  do  n't  know  where  it  was  before  you  looked  at  it <period> by  measuring  it <comma> the  act  of  measurement  changes  it <period> the  act  of  observation  changes  it <period> it  's  the  same  in  marketing <period> so  with  the  act  of  observing  consumers <comma> changes  their  behavior <period> think  about  the  group  of  moms  who  are  talking  about  their  wonderful  children  in  a  focus  group <comma> and  almost  none  of  them  buy  lots  of  junk  food <period> and  yet <comma> mcdonald  's  sells  hundreds  of  millions  of  burgers  every  year <period> think  about  the  people  who  are  on  accompanied  shops  in  supermarkets <comma> who  stuff  their  trolleys  full  of  fresh  green  vegetables  and  fruit <comma> but  do  n't  shop  like  that  any  other  day <period> and  if  you  think  about  the  number  of  people  who  claim  in  surveys  to  regularly  look  for  porn  on  the  web <comma> it  's  very  few <period> yet <comma> at  google <comma> we  know  it  's  the  number-one  searched  for  category <period> so  luckily <comma> the  science <comma> no <comma> sorry <comma> the  marketing  is  getting  easier <period> luckily <comma> with  now  better  point-of-sale  tracking <comma> more  digital  media  consumption <comma> you  can  measure  more  what  consumers  actually  do <comma> rather  than  what  they  say  they  do <period> so  the  physics  is  you  can  never  accurately  and  exactly  measure  a  particle <comma> because  the  observation  changes  it <period> the  marketing  is <comma> the  message  for  marketing  is <comma> that  try  to  measure  what  consumers  actually  do <comma> rather  than  what  they  say  they  'll  do  or  anticipate  they  'll  do <period> so  next <comma> the  scientific  method <comma> an  axiom  of  physics <comma> of  all  science <comma> says  you  cannot  prove  a  hypothesis  through  observation <period> you  can  only  disprove  it <period> what  this  means  is  you  can  gather  more  and  more  data  around  a  hypothesis  or  a  positioning <comma> and  it  will  strengthen  it <comma> but  it  will  not  conclusively  prove  it <period> and  only  one  contrary  data  point  can  blow  your  theory  out  of  the  water <period> so  if  we  take  an  example <comma> ptolemy  had  dozens  of  data  points  to  support  his  theory  that  the  planets  would  rotate  around  the  earth <period> it  only  took  one  robust  observation  from  copernicus  to  blow  that  idea  out  of  the  water <period> and  there  are  parallels  for  marketing  -- <period> you  can  invest  for  a  long  time  in  a  brand <comma> but  a  single  contrary  observation  of  that  positioning  will  destroy  consumers  belief <period> take  bp  -- <period> they  spent  millions  of  pounds  over  many  years  building  up  its  credentials  as  an  environmentally  friendly  brand <comma> but  then  one  little  accident <period> think  about  toyota <period> it  was <comma> for  a  long  time <comma> revered  as  the  most  reliable  of  cars <comma> and  then  they  had  the  big  recall  incident <period> and  tiger  woods <comma> for  a  long  time <comma> the  perfect  brand  ambassador <period> well <comma> you  know  the  story <period> so  the  physics  is  that  you  cannot  prove  a  hypothesis <comma> but  it  's  easy  to  disprove  it  -- <period> any  hypothesis  is  shaky <period> and  the  marketing  is  that  not  matter  how  much  you've  invested  in  your  brand <comma> one  bad  week  can  undermine  decades  of  good  work <period> so  be  really  careful  to  try  and  avoid  the  screw-ups  that  can  undermine  your  brand <period> and  lastly <comma> to  the  slightly  obscure  world  of  entropy <comma> the  second  law  of  thermodynamics <period> this  says  that  entropy <comma> which  is  a  measure  of  the  disorder  of  a  system <comma> will  always  increase <period> the  same  is  true  of  marketing <period> if  we  go  back  20  years <comma> the  one  message  pretty  much  controlled  by  one  marketing  manager  could  pretty  much  define  a  brand <period> but  where  we  are  today <comma> things  have  changed <period> you  can  get  a  strong  brand  image  or  a  message  and  put  it  out  there  like  the  conservative  party  did  earlier  this  year  with  their  election  poster <period> but  then  you  lose  control  of  it <period> with  the  kind  of  digital  comment  creation  and  distribution  tools  that  are  available  now  to  every  consumer <comma> it  's  impossible  to  control  where  it  goes <period> your  brand  starts  being  dispersed <period> it  gets  more  chaotic <period> it  's  out  of  your  control <period> i  actually  saw  him  speak <comma> he  did  a  good  job <period> but  while  this  may  be  unsettling  for  marketers <comma> it  's  actually  a  good  thing <period> this  distribution  of  brand  energy  gets  your  brand  closer  to  the  people <comma> more  in  with  the  people <period> it  makes  this  distribution  of  energy  a  democratizing  force <comma> which  is  ultimately  good  for  your  brand <period> so <comma> the  lesson  from  physics  is  that  entropy  will  always  increase <period> it  's  a  fundamental  law <period> the  message  for  marketing  is  that  your  brand  is  more  dispersed <period> you  cannot  fight  it <comma> so  embrace  it  and  find  a  way  to  work  with  it <period> so  to  close <comma> my  teacher <comma> mr.  vutter <comma> told  me  that  physics  is  cool <comma> and  hopefully <comma> i've  convinced  you  that  physics  can  teach  all  of  us <comma> even  in  the  world  of  marketing <comma> something  special <period> thank  you <period> as  you  pointed  out <comma> every  time  you  come  here <comma> you  learn  something <period> this  morning <comma> the  world  's  experts  from  i  guess  three  or  four  different  companies  on  building  seats <comma> i  think  concluded  that  ultimately <comma> the  solution  is <comma> people  should  n't  sit  down <period> i  could  have  told  them  that <period> yesterday <comma> the  automotive  guys  gave  us  some  new  insights <period> they  pointed  out  that <comma> i  believe  it  was  between  30  and  50  years  from  today <comma> they  will  be  steering  cars  by  wire <comma> without  all  that  mechanical  stuff <period> that  's  reassuring <period> they  then  pointed  out  that  there'd  be <comma> sort  of <comma> the  other  controls  by  wire <comma> to  get  rid  of  all  that  mechanical  stuff <period> that  's  pretty  good <comma> but  why  not  get  rid  of  the  wires <questionmark> then  you  do  n't  need  anything  to  control  the  car <comma> except  thinking  about  it <period> i  would  love  to  talk  about  the  technology <comma> and  sometime <comma> in  what  's  past  the  15  minutes <comma> i  'll  be  happy  to  talk  to  all  the  techno-geeks  around  here  about  what  's  in  here <period> but  if  i  had  one  thing  to  say  about  this <comma> before  we  get  to  first <comma> it  would  be  that  from  the  time  we  started  building  this <comma> the  big  idea  was  n't  the  technology <period> it  really  was  a  big  idea  in  technology  when  we  started  applying  it  in  the  ibot  for  the  disabled  community <period> the  big  idea  here  is <comma> i  think <comma> a  new  piece  of  a  solution  to  a  fairly  big  problem  in  transportation <period> and  maybe  to  put  that  in  perspective <comma> there  's  so  much  data  on  this <comma> i  'll  be  happy  to  give  it  to  you  in  different  forms <period> you  never  know  what  strikes  the  fancy  of  whom <comma> but  everybody  is  perfectly  willing  to  believe  the  car  changed  the  world <period> and  henry  ford <comma> just  about  100  years  ago <comma> started  cranking  out  model  ts <period> what  i  do  n't  think  most  people  think  about  is  the  context  of  how  technology  is  applied <period> for  instance <comma> in  that  time <comma> 91  percent  of  america  lived  either  on  farms  or  in  small  towns <period> so <comma> the  car <comma> the  horseless  carriage  that  replaced  the  horse  and  carriage <comma> was  a  big  deal <period> it  went  twice  as  fast  as  a  horse  and  carriage <period> it  was  half  as  long <period> and  it  was  an  environmental  improvement <comma> because <comma> for  instance <comma> in  1903  they  outlawed  horses  and  buggies  in  downtown  manhattan <comma> because  you  can  imagine  what  the  roads  look  like  when  you  have  a  million  horses <comma> and  a  million  of  them  urinating  and  doing  other  things <comma> and  the  typhoid  and  other  problems  created  were  almost  unimaginable <period> so  the  car  was  the  clean  environmental  alternative  to  a  horse  and  buggy <period> it  also  was  a  way  for  people  to  get  from  their  farm  to  a  farm <comma> or  their  farm  to  a  town <comma> or  from  a  town  to  a  city <period> it  all  made  sense <comma> with  91  percent  of  the  people  living  there <period> by  the  1950s <comma> we  started  connecting  all  the  towns  together  with  what  a  lot  of  people  claim  is  the  eighth  wonder  of  the  world <comma> the  highway  system <period> and  it  is  certainly  a  wonder <period> and  by  the  way <comma> as  i  take  shots  at  old  technologies <comma> i  want  to  assure  everybody <comma> and  particularly  the  automotive  industry <comma> who  's  been  very  supportive  of  us <comma> that  i  do  n't  think  this  in  any  way  competes  with  airplanes <comma> or  cars <period> but  think  about  where  the  world  is  today <period> 50  percent  of  the  global  population  now  lives  in  cities <period> that  's  32  billion  people <period> we've  solved  all  the  transportation  problems  that  have  changed  the  world  to  get  it  to  where  we  are  today <period> 500  years  ago <comma> sailing  ships  started  getting  reliable  enough <period> we  found  a  new  continent <period> 150  years  ago <comma> locomotives  got  efficient  enough <comma> steam  power <comma> that  we  turned  the  continent  into  a  country <period> over  the  last  hundred  years <comma> we  started  building  cars <comma> and  then  over  the  50  years  we've  connected  every  city  to  every  other  city  in  an  extraordinarily  efficient  way <comma> and  we  have  a  very  high  standard  of  living  as  a  consequence  of  that <period> but  during  that  entire  process <comma> more  and  more  people  have  been  born <comma> and  more  and  more  people  are  moving  to  cities <period> china  alone  is  going  to  move  four  to  six  hundred  million  people  into  cities  in  the  next  decade  and  a  half <period> and  so <comma> nobody <comma> i  think <comma> would  argue  that  airplanes <comma> in  the  last  50  years <comma> have  turned  the  continent  and  the  country  now  into  a  neighborhood <period> and  if  you  just  look  at  how  technology  has  been  applied <comma> we've  solved  all  the  long-range <comma> high-speed <comma> high-volume <comma> large-weight  problems  of  moving  things  around <period> nobody  would  want  to  give  them  up <period> and  i  certainly  would  n't  want  to  give  up  my  airplane <comma> or  my  helicopter <comma> or  my  humvee <comma> or  my  porsche <period> i  love  them  all <period> i  do  n't  keep  any  of  them  in  my  living  room <period> the  fact  is <comma> the  last  mile  is  the  problem <comma> and  half  the  world  now  lives  in  dense  cities <period> and  people  spend <comma> depending  on  who  they  are <comma> between  90  and  95  percent  of  their  energy  getting  around  on  foot <period> i  think  there  's <comma> i  do  n't  know  what  data  would  impress  you <comma> but  how  about <comma> 43  percent  of  the  refined  fuel  produced  in  the  world  is  consumed  by  cars  in  metropolitan  areas  in  the  united  states <period> three  million  people  die  every  year  in  cities  due  to  bad  air <comma> and  almost  all  particulate  pollution  on  this  planet  is  produced  by  transportation  devices <comma> particularly  sitting  in  cities <period> and  again <comma> i  say  that  not  to  attack  any  industry <comma> i  think <comma> i  really  do <comma> i  love  my  airplane <comma> and  cars  on  highways  moving  60  miles  an  hour  are  extraordinarily  efficient <comma> both  from  an  engineering  point  of  view <comma> an  energy  consumption  point  of  view <comma> and  a  utility  point  of  view <period> and  we  all  love  our  cars <comma> and  i  do <period> the  problem  is <comma> you  get  into  the  city  and  you  want  to  go  four  blocks <comma> it  's  neither  fun  nor  efficient  nor  productive <period> it  's  not  sustainable <period> if <comma> in  china <comma> in  the  year  1998 <comma> 417  million  people  used  bicycles <period> 17  million  people  used  cars <period> if  five  percent  of  that  population  became <comma> quote <comma> middle  class <comma> and  wanted  to  go  the  way  we've  gone  in  the  last  hundred  years  at  the  same  time  that  50  percent  of  their  population  are  moving  into  cities  of  the  size  and  density  of  manhattan <comma> every  six  weeks <comma> it  is  n't  sustainable  environmentally <period> it  is  n't  sustainable  economically <comma> there  just  ai  n't  enough  oil  -- <period> and  it  's  not  sustainable  politically <period> i  mean <comma> what  are  we  fighting  over  right  now <questionmark> we  can  make  it  complicated <comma> but  what  's  the  world  fighting  over  right  now <questionmark> so  it  seemed  to  me  that  somebody  had  to  work  on  that  last  mile <comma> and  it  was  dumb  luck <period> we  were  working  on  ibots <period> but  once  we  made  this <comma> we  instantly  decided  it  could  be  a  great  alternative  to  jet  skis <period> you  do  n't  need  the  water <period> or  snowmobiles <period> you  do  n't  need  the  snow <period> or  skiing <period> it  's  just  fun <comma> and  people  love  to  move  around  doing  fun  things <period> and  every  one  of  those  industries <comma> by  the  way <comma> just  golf  carts  alone  is  a  multi-billion-dollar  industry <period> but  rather  than  go  license  this  off <comma> which  is  what  we  normally  do <comma> it  seemed  to  me  that  if  we  put  all  our  effort  not  into  the  technology <comma> but  into  an  understanding  of  a  world  that  's  solved  all  its  other  problems <comma> but  has  somehow  come  to  accept  that  cities <comma> which <comma> right  back  from  ancient  greece  on <comma> were  meant  to  walk  around <comma> cities  that  were  architected  and  built  for  people <comma> now  have  a  footprint  that <comma> while  we've  solved  every  other  transportation  problem <comma> and  it  's  like  moore  's  law <period> i  mean <comma> look  at  the  time  it  took  to  cross  a  continent  in  a  conestoga  wagon <comma> then  on  a  railroad <comma> then  an  airplane <period> every  other  form  of  transportation  's  been  improved <period> in  5,000  years <comma> we've  gone  backwards  in  getting  around  cities <period> they've  gotten  bigger <period> they  're  spread  out <period> the  most  expensive  real  estate  on  this  planet  in  every  city <comma> wilshire  boulevard <comma> or  fifth  avenue <comma> or  tokyo <comma> or  paris <comma> the  most  expensive  real  estate  is  their  downtowns <period> 65  percent  of  the  landmass  of  our  cities  are  parked  cars <period> the  20  largest  cities  in  the  world <period> so  you  wonder <comma> what  if  cities  could  give  to  their  pedestrians  what  we  take  for  granted  as  we  now  go  between  cities <questionmark> what  if  you  could  make  them  fun <comma> attractive <comma> clean <comma> environmentally  friendly <questionmark> what  if  it  would  make  it  a  little  bit  more  palatable  to  have  access  via  this <comma> as  that  last  link  to  mass  transit <comma> to  get  out  to  your  cars  so  we  can  all  live  in  the  suburbs  and  use  our  cars  the  way  we  want <comma> and  then  have  our  cities  energized  again <questionmark> we  thought  it  would  be  really  neat  to  do  that <comma> and  one  of  the  problems  we  really  were  worried  about  is <comma> how  do  we  get  legal  on  the  sidewalk <questionmark> because  technically  i've  got  motors <period> i've  got  wheels <comma> i  'm  a  motor  vehicle <period> i  do  n't  look  like  a  motor  vehicle <period> i  have  the  same  footprint  as  a  pedestrian <period> i  have  the  same  unique  capability  to  deal  with  other  pedestrians  in  a  crowded  space <period> i  took  this  down  to  ground  zero <comma> and  knocked  my  way  through  crowds  for  an  hour <period> i  'm  a  pedestrian <period> but  the  law  typically  lags  technology  by  a  generation  or  two <comma> and  if  we  get  told  we  do  n't  belong  on  the  sidewalk <comma> we  have  two  choices <period> we  're  a  recreational  vehicle  that  does  n't  really  matter <comma> and  i  do  n't  spend  my  time  doing  that  kind  of  stuff <period> or  maybe  we  should  be  out  in  the  street  in  front  of  a  greyhound  bus  or  a  vehicle <period> we've  been  so  concerned  about  that <comma> we  went  to  the  postmaster  general  of  the  united  states <comma> as  the  first  person  we  ever  showed  on  the  outside <comma> and  said <comma> put  your  people  on  it <period> everybody  trusts  their  postman <period> and  they  belong  on  the  sidewalks <comma> and  they  'll  use  it  seriously <period> he  agreed <period> we  went  to  a  number  of  police  departments  that  want  their  police  officers  back  in  the  neighborhood  on  the  beat <comma> carrying  70  pounds  of  stuff <period> they  love  it <period> and  i  cannot  believe  a  policeman  is  going  to  give  themselves  a  ticket <period> so  we've  been  working  really <comma> really  hard <comma> but  we  knew  that  the  technology  would  not  be  as  hard  to  develop  as  an  attitude  about  what  's  important <comma> and  how  to  apply  the  technology <period> we  went  out  and  we  found  some  visionary  people  with  enough  money  to  let  us  design  and  build  these  things <comma> and  in  hopefully  enough  time  to  get  them  accepted <period> so <comma> i  'm  happy <comma> really <comma> i  am  happy  to  talk  about  this  technology  as  much  as  you  want <period> and  yes <comma> it  's  really  fun <comma> and  yes <comma> you  should  all  go  out  and  try  it <period> but  if  i  could  ask  you  to  do  one  thing <comma> it  's  not  to  think  about  it  as  a  piece  of  technology <comma> but  just  imagine  that <comma> although  we  all  understand  somehow  that  it  's  reasonable  that  we  use  our  4,000-pound  machine <comma> which  can  go  60  miles  an  hour <comma> that  can  bring  you  everywhere  you  want  to  go <comma> and  somehow  it  's  also  what  we  used  for  the  last  mile <comma> and  it  's  broken <comma> and  it  does  n't  work <period> one  of  the  more  exciting  things  that  occurred  to  us  about  why  it  might  get  accepted <comma> happened  out  here  in  california <period> a  few  weeks  ago <comma> after  we  launched  it <comma> we  were  here  with  a  news  crew  on  venice  beach <comma> zipping  up  and  back <comma> and  he  's  marveling  at  the  technology <comma> and  meanwhile  bicycles  are  zipping  by <comma> and  skateboarders  are  zipping  by <comma> and  a  little  old  lady <comma> i  mean <comma> if  you  looked  in  the  dictionary <comma> a  little  old  lady <comma> came  by  me <comma> and  now  that  i  'm  on  this <comma> i  'm  the  height  of  a  normal  adult  now <comma> and  she  just  stops <comma> and  the  camera  is  there <comma> and  she  looks  up  at  me  and  says <comma> can  i  try  that <questionmark> and  what  was  i <comma> you  know <comma> how  are  you  going  to  say  anything <questionmark> and  so  i  said <comma> sure <period> so  i  get  off <comma> and  she  gets  on <comma> and  with  a  little  bit  of  the  usual <comma> ah <comma> then  she  turns  around <comma> and  she  goes  about  20  feet <comma> and  she  turns  back  around <comma> and  she  's  all  smiles <period> and  she  comes  back  to  me  and  she  stops <comma> and  she  says <comma> finally <comma> they  made  something  for  us <period> and  the  camera  is  looking  down  at  her <period> i  'm  thinking <comma> wow <comma> that  was  great <comma> please  lady <comma> do  n't  say  another  word <period> and  the  camera  is  down  at  her <comma> and  this  guy  has  to  put  the  microphone  in  her  face <comma> said <comma> what  do  you  mean  by  that <questionmark> and  i  figured <comma> it  's  all  over  now <comma> and  she  looks  up  and  she  says <comma> well <comma> she  's  still  watching  these  guys  go <period> she  says <comma> i  cannot  ride  a  bike <comma> no <comma> she  says <comma> i  cannot  use  a  skateboard <comma> and  i've  never  used  roller  blades <comma> she  knew  them  by  name <period> she  says <comma> and  it  's  been  50  years  since  i  rode  a  bicycle <period> then  she  looks  up <comma> she  's  looking  up <comma> and  she  says <comma> and  i  'm  81  years  old <comma> and  i  do  n't  drive  a  car  anymore <period> i  still  have  to  get  to  the  store <comma> and  i  cannot  carry  a  lot  of  things <period> and  it  suddenly  occurred  to  me <comma> that  among  my  many  fears <comma> were  not  just  that  the  bureaucracy  and  the  regulators  and  the  legislators  might  not  get  it <comma> it  was  that <comma> fundamentally <comma> you  believe  there  's  pressure  among  the  people  not  to  invade  the  most  precious  little  bit  of  space  left <comma> the  sidewalks  in  these  cities <period> when  you  look  at  the  36  inches  of  legal  requirement  for  sidewalk <comma> then  the  eight  foot  for  the  parked  car <comma> then  the  three  lanes <comma> and  then  the  other  eight  feet <comma> it  's <comma> that  little  piece  is  all  that  's  there <period> but  she  looks  up  and  says  this <comma> and  it  occurs  to  me <comma> well <comma> kids  are  n't  going  to  mind  these  things <comma> and  they  do  n't  vote <comma> and  business  people  and  then  young  adults  are  n't  going  to  mind  these  things <comma> they  're  pretty  cool <comma> so  i  guess  subliminally  i  was  worried  that  it  's  the  older  population  that  's  going  to  worry <period> so <comma> having  seen  this <comma> and  having  worried  about  it  for  eight  years <comma> the  first  thing  i  do  is  pick  up  my  phone  and  ask  our  marketing  and  regulatory  guys <comma> call  aarp <comma> get  an  appointment  right  away <period> we've  got  to  show  them  this  thing <period> and  they  took  it  to  washington <period> they  showed  them <period> and  they  're  going  to  be  involved  now <comma> watching  how  these  things  get  absorbed  in  a  number  of  cities <comma> like  atlanta <comma> where  we  're  doing  trials  to  see  if  it  really  can <comma> in  fact <comma> help  re-energize  their  downtown <period> the  bottom  line  is <comma> whether  you  believe  the  united  nations <comma> or  any  of  the  other  think  tanks <comma> in  the  next  20  years <comma> all  human  population  growth  on  this  planet  will  be  in  cities <period> in  asia  alone <comma> it  will  be  over  a  billion  people <period> they  learned  to  start  with  cell  phones <period> they  did  n't  have  to  take  the  100-year  trip  we  took <period> they  start  at  the  top  of  the  technology  food  chain <period> we've  got  to  start  building  cities  and  human  environments  where  a  150-pound  person  can  go  a  couple  of  miles  in  a  dense <comma> rich <comma> green-space  environment <comma> without  being  in  a  4,000-pound  machine  to  do  it <period> cars  were  not  meant  for  parallel  parking <period> they  're  wonderful  machines  to  go  between  cities <comma> but  just  think  about  it <comma> we've  solved  all  the  long-range <comma> high-speed  problems <period> the  greeks  went  from  the  theater  of  dionysus  to  the  parthenon  in  their  sandals <period> you  do  it  in  your  sneakers <period> not  much  has  changed <period> if  this  thing  goes  only  three  times  as  fast  as  walking <comma> three  times <comma> a  30-minute  walk  becomes  10  minutes <period> your  choice <comma> when  living  in  a  city <comma> if  it  's  now  10  minutes <comma> because  at  30  minutes  you  want  an  alternative <comma> whether  it  's  a  bus <comma> a  train  -- <period> we've  got  to  build  an  infrastructure <comma> a  light  rail <comma> or  you  're  going  to  keep  parking  those  cars <period> but  if  you  could  put  a  pin  in  most  cities <comma> and  imagine  how  far  you  could <comma> if  you  had  the  time <comma> walk  in  one  half-hour <comma> it  's  the  city <period> if  you  could  make  it  fun <comma> and  make  it  eight  or  10  minutes <comma> you  cannot  find  your  car <comma> un-park  your  car <comma> move  your  car <comma> re-park  your  car  and  go  somewhere <period> you  cannot  get  to  a  cab  or  a  subway <period> we  could  change  the  way  people  allocate  their  resources <comma> the  way  this  planet  uses  its  energy <comma> make  it  more  fun <period> and  we  're  hoping  to  some  extent  history  will  say  we  were  right <period> that  's  segway <period> this  is  a  stirling  cycle  engine <period> this  had  been  confused  by  a  lot  of  things  we  're  doing <period> this  little  beast <comma> right  now <comma> is  producing  a  few  hundred  watts  of  electricity <period> yes <comma> it  could  be  attached  to  this <comma> and  yes <comma> on  a  kilogram  of  propane <comma> you  could  drive  from  new  york  to  boston  if  you  so  choose <period> perhaps  more  interesting  about  this  little  engine  is  it  'll  burn  any  fuel <comma> because  some  of  you  might  be  skeptical  about  the  capability  of  this  to  have  an  impact <comma> where  most  of  the  world  you  cannot  simply  plug  into  your  120-volt  outlet <period> we've  been  working  on  this <comma> actually <comma> as  an  alternative  energy  source <comma> starting  way  back  with  johnson  &amp <period> johnson <comma> to  run  an  ibot <comma> because  the  best  batteries  you  could  get <comma> 10  watt-hours  per  kilogram  in  lead <comma> 20  watt-hours  per  kilogram  nickel-cadmium <comma> 40  watt-hours  per  kilogram  in  nickel-metal  hydride <comma> 60  watt-hours  per  kilogram  in  lithium <comma> 8,750  watt-hours  of  energy  in  every  kilogram  of  propane  or  gasoline <comma> which  is  why  nobody  drives  electric  cars <period> but <comma> in  any  event <comma> if  you  can  burn  it  with  the  same  efficiency <comma> because  it  's  external  combustion <comma> as  your  kitchen  stove <comma> if  you  can  burn  any  fuel <comma> it  turns  out  to  be  pretty  neat <period> it  makes  just  enough  electricity  to <comma> for  instance <comma> do  this <comma> which  at  night  is  enough  electricity <comma> in  the  rest  of  the  world <comma> as  mr.  holly <comma> dr.  holly <comma> pointed  out <comma> can  run  computers  and  a  light  bulb <period> but  more  interestingly <comma> the  thermodynamics  of  this  say <comma> you  're  never  going  to  get  more  than  20  percent  efficiency <period> it  does  n't  matter  much <comma> it  says  if  you  get  200  watts  of  electricity <comma> you  'll  get  700  or  800  watts  of  heat <period> if  you  wanted  to  boil  water  and  re-condense  it  at  a  rate  of  10  gallons  an  hour <comma> it  takes  about  25 <comma> a  little  over  253  kilowatt <comma> 25,000  watts  of  continuous  power <comma> to  do  it <period> that  's  so  much  energy <comma> you  could  n't  afford  to  desalinate  or  clean  water  in  this  country  that  way <period> certainly <comma> in  the  rest  of  the  world <comma> your  choice  is  to  devastate  the  place <comma> turning  everything  that  will  burn  into  heat <comma> or  drink  the  water  that  's  available <period> the  number  one  cause  of  death  on  this  planet  among  humans  is  bad  water <period> depending  on  whose  numbers  you  believe <comma> it  's  between  60  and  85,000  people  per  day <period> we  do  n't  need  sophisticated  heart  transplants  around  the  world <period> we  need  water <period> and  women  should  n't  have  to  spend  four  hours  a  day  looking  for  it <comma> or  watching  their  kids  die <period> we  figured  out  how  to  put  a  vapor-compression  distiller  on  this  thing <comma> with  a  counter-flow  heat  exchanger  to  take  the  waste  heat <comma> then  using  a  little  bit  of  the  electricity  control  that  process <comma> and  for  450  watts <comma> which  is  a  little  more  than  half  of  its  waste  heat <comma> it  will  make  10  gallons  an  hour  of  distilled  water  from  anything  that  comes  into  it  to  cool  it <period> so  if  we  put  this  box  on  here  in  a  few  years <comma> could  we  have  a  solution  to  transportation <comma> electricity <comma> and  communication <comma> and  maybe  drinkable  water  in  a  sustainable  package  that  weighs  60  pounds <questionmark> i  do  n't  know <comma> but  we  'll  try  it <period> i  better  shut  up <period> the  new  me  is  beauty <period> yeah <comma> people  used  to  say <comma> norman  's  ok <comma> but  if  you  followed  what  he  said <comma> everything  would  be  usable  but  it  would  be  ugly <period> well <comma> i  did  n't  have  that  in  mind <comma> so <period> this  is  neat <period> thank  you  for  setting  up  my  display <period> i  mean <comma> it  's  just  wonderful <period> and  i  have  n't  the  slightest  idea  of  what  it  does  or  what  it  's  good  for <comma> but  i  want  it <period> and  that  's  my  new  life <period> my  new  life  is  trying  to  understand  what  beauty  is  about <comma> and  pretty <comma> and  emotions <period> the  new  me  is  all  about  making  things  kind  of  neat  and  fun <period> and  so  this  is  a  philippe  starck  juicer <comma> produced  by  alessi <period> it  's  just  neat <period> it  's  fun <period> it  's  so  much  fun  i  have  it  in  my  house <comma> but  i  have  it  in  the  entryway <comma> i  do  n't  use  it  to  make  juice <period> in  fact <comma> i  bought  the  gold-plated  special  edition  and  it  comes  with  a  little  slip  of  paper  that  says <comma> do  n't  use  this  juicer  to  make  juice <period> the  acid  will  ruin  the  gold  plating <period> so  actually <comma> i  took  a  carton  of  orange  juice  and  i  poured  it  in  the  glass  to  take  this  picture <period> beneath  it  is  a  wonderful  knife <period> it  's  a  global  cutting  knife  made  in  japan <period> first  of  all <comma> look  at  the  shape <comma> it  's  just  wonderful  to  look  at <period> second  of  all <comma> it  's  really  beautifully  balanced <comma> it  holds  well <comma> it  feels  well <period> and  third  of  all <comma> it  's  so  sharp <comma> it  just  cuts <period> it  's  a  delight  to  use <period> and  so  it  's  got  everything <comma> right <questionmark> it  's  beautiful  and  it  's  functional <period> and  i  can  tell  you  stories  about  it <comma> which  makes  it  reflective <comma> and  so  you  'll  see  i  have  a  theory  of  emotion <period> and  those  are  the  three  components <period> hiroshi  ishii  and  his  group  at  the  mit  media  lab  took  a  ping-pong  table  and  placed  a  projector  above  it <comma> and  on  the  ping-pong  table  they  projected  an  image  of  water  with  fish  swimming  in  it <period> and  as  you  play  ping-pong <comma> whenever  the  ball  hits  part  of  the  table <comma> the  ripples  spread  out  and  the  fish  run  away <period> but  of  course <comma> then  the  ball  hits  the  other  side <comma> the  ripples  hit  the <comma> poor  fish <comma> they  cannot  find  any  peace  and  quiet <period> is  that  a  good  way  to  play  ping-pong <questionmark> no <period> but  is  it  fun <questionmark> yeah <period> yeah <period> or  look  at  google <period> if  you  type  in <comma> oh  say <comma> emotion  and  design <comma> you  get  10  pages  of  results <period> so  google  just  took  their  logo  and  they  spread  it  out <period> instead  of  saying <comma> you  got  73,000  results <period> this  is  one  through  20 <period> next <comma> they  just  give  you  as  many  o  's  as  there  are  pages <period> it  's  really  simple  and  subtle <period> i  bet  a  lot  of  you  have  seen  it  and  never  noticed  it <period> that  's  the  subconscious  mind  that  sort  of  notices  it <comma> it  probably  is  kind  of  pleasant  and  you  did  n't  know  why <period> and  it  's  just  clever <period> and  of  course <comma> what  's  especially  good  is <comma> if  you  type  design  and  emotion <comma> the  first  response  out  of  those  10  pages  is  my  website <period> now <comma> the  weird  thing  is  google  lies <comma> because  if  i  type  design  and  emotion <comma> it  says <comma> you  do  n't  need  the  and  we  do  it  anyway  so <comma> ok <period> so  i  type  design  emotion  and  my  website  was  n't  first  again <period> it  was  third <period> oh  well <comma> different  story <period> there  was  this  wonderful  review  in  the  new  york  times  about  the  mini  cooper  automobile <period> it  said <comma> you  know <comma> this  is  a  car  that  has  lots  of  faults <period> buy  it  anyway <period> it  's  so  much  fun  to  drive <period> and  if  you  look  at  the  inside  of  the  car <comma> i  mean <comma> i  loved  it <comma> i  wanted  to  see  it <comma> i  rented  it <comma> this  is  me  taking  a  picture  while  my  son  is  driving <comma> and  the  inside  of  the  car <comma> the  whole  design  is  fun <period> it  's  round <comma> it  's  neat <period> the  controls  work  wonderfully <period> so  that  's  my  new  life <period> it  's  all  about  fun <period> i  really  have  the  feeling  that  pleasant  things  work  better <comma> and  that  never  made  any  sense  to  me  until  i  finally  figured  out <comma> look <period> i  'm  going  to  put  a  plank  on  the  ground <period> so <comma> imagine  i  have  a  plank  about  two  feet  wide  and  30  feet  long <period> and  i  'm  going  to  walk  on  it <comma> and  you  see  i  can  walk  on  it  without  looking <period> i  can  go  back  and  forth  and  i  can  jump  up  and  down <period> no  problem <period> now  i  'm  going  to  put  the  plank  300  feet  in  the  air  -- <period> and  i  'm  not  going  to  go  near  it <comma> thank  you <period> intense  fear  paralyzes  you <period> it  actually  affects  the  way  the  brain  works <period> so <comma> paul  saffo <comma> before  his  talk  said  that  he  did  n't  really  have  it  down  until  just  a  few  days  or  hours  before  the  talk <comma> and  that  anxiety  was  really  helpful  in  causing  him  to  focus <period> that  's  what  fear  and  anxiety  does <period> it  causes  you  to  be <comma> what  's  called  depth-first  processing <comma> to  focus <comma> not  be  distracted <period> and  i  could  n't  force  myself  across  that <period> now  some  people  can <comma> circus  workers <comma> steel  workers <period> but  it  really  changes  the  way  you  think <period> and  then <comma> a  psychologist <comma> alice  isen <comma> did  this  wonderful  experiment <period> she  brought  students  in  to  solve  problems <period> so <comma> she'd  bring  people  into  the  room <comma> and  there'd  be  a  string  hanging  down  here  and  a  string  hanging  down  here <period> it  was  an  empty  room <comma> except  for  a  table  with  a  bunch  of  crap  on  it <comma> some  papers  and  scissors  and  stuff <period> and  she'd  bring  them  in <comma> and  she'd  say <comma> this  is  an  iq  test  and  it  determines  how  well  you  do  in  life <period> would  you  tie  those  two  strings  together <questionmark> so  they'd  take  one  string  and  they'd  pull  it  over  here  and  they  could  n't  reach  the  other  string <period> still  cannot  reach  it <period> and <comma> basically <comma> none  of  them  could  solve  it <period> you  bring  in  a  second  group  of  people <comma> and  you  say <comma> oh <comma> before  we  start <comma> i  got  this  box  of  candy <comma> and  i  do  n't  eat  candy <period> would  you  like  the  box  of  candy <questionmark> and  turns  out  they  liked  it <comma> and  it  made  them  happy  -- <period> not  very  happy <comma> but  a  little  bit  of  happy <period> and  guess  what <comma> they  solved  the  problem <period> and  it  turns  out  that  when  you  're  anxious  you  squirt  neural  transmitters  in  the  brain <comma> which  focuses  you  makes  you  depth-first <period> and  when  you  're  happy <comma> what  we  call  positive  valence <comma> you  squirt  dopamine  into  the  prefrontal  lobes <comma> which  makes  you  a  breadth-first  problem  solver <comma> you  're  more  susceptible  to  interruption <period> you  do  out-of-the-box  thinking <period> that  's  what  brainstorming  is  about <comma> right <questionmark> with  brainstorming  we  make  you  happy <comma> we  play  games <comma> and  we  say <comma> no  criticism <comma> and  you  get  all  these  weird <comma> neat  ideas <period> but  in  fact <comma> if  that  's  how  you  always  were  you'd  never  get  any  work  done  because  you'd  be  working  along  and  say <comma> oh <comma> i  got  a  new  way  of  doing  it <period> so  to  get  work  done <comma> you've  got  to  set  a  deadline <comma> right <questionmark> you've  got  be  anxious <period> the  brain  works  differently  if  you  're  happy <period> things  work  better  because  you  're  more  creative <period> you  get  a  little  problem <comma> you  say <comma> ah <comma> i  'll  figure  it  out <period> no  big  deal <period> there  's  something  i  call  the  visceral  level  of  processing <comma> and  there  will  be  visceral-level  design <period> biology <comma> we  have  co-adapted  through  biology  to  like  bright  colors <period> that  's  especially  good  that  mammals  and  primates  like  fruits  and  bright  plants <comma> because  you  eat  the  fruit  and  you  thereby  spread  the  seed <period> there  's  an  amazing  amount  of  stuff  that  's  built  into  the  brain <period> we  dislike  bitter  tastes <comma> we  dislike  loud  sounds <comma> we  dislike  hot  temperatures <comma> cold  temperatures <period> we  dislike  scolding  voices <period> we  dislike  frowning  faces <period> we  like  symmetrical  faces <comma> etc <comma> etc <period> so  that  's  the  visceral  level <period> in  design <comma> you  can  express  visceral  in  lots  of  ways <comma> like  the  choice  of  type  fonts  and  the  red  for  hot <comma> exciting <period> or  the  1963  jaguar: <period> it  's  actually  a  crummy  car <comma> falls  apart  all  the  time <comma> but  the  owners  love  it <period> and  it  's  beautiful <comma> it  's  in  the  museum  of  modern  art <period> a  water  bottle: <period> you  buy  it  because  of  the  bottle <comma> not  because  of  the  water <period> and  when  people  are  finished <comma> they  do  n't  throw  it  away <period> they  keep  it  for <comma> you  know <comma> it  's  like  the  old  wine  bottles <comma> you  keep  it  for  decoration  or  maybe  fill  it  with  water  again <comma> which  proves  it  's  not  the  water <period> it  's  all  about  the  visceral  experience <period> the  middle  level  of  processing  is  the  behavioral  level  and  that  's  actually  where  most  of  our  stuff  gets  done <period> visceral  is  subconscious <comma> you  're  unaware  of  it <period> behavioral  is  subconscious <comma> you  're  unaware  of  it <period> almost  everything  we  do  is  subconscious <period> i  'm  walking  around  the  stage <comma> i  'm  not  attending  to  the  control  of  my  legs <period> i  'm  doing  a  lot <period> most  of  my  talk  is  subconscious <period> it  has  been  rehearsed  and  thought  about  a  lot <period> most  of  what  we  do  is  subconscious <period> automatic  behavior <comma> skilled  behavior <comma> is  subconscious <comma> controlled  by  the  behavioral  side <period> and  behavioral  design  is  all  about  feeling  in  control <comma> which  includes  usability <comma> understanding <comma> but  also  the  feel  and  heft <period> that  's  why  the  global  knives  are  so  neat <period> they  're  so  nicely  balanced <comma> so  sharp <comma> that  you  really  feel  you  're  in  control  of  the  cutting <period> or <comma> just  driving  a  high-performance  sports  car  over  a  demanding  curb <comma> again <comma> feeling  that  you  are  in  complete  control  of  the  environment <period> or  the  sensual  feeling <period> this  is  a  kohler  shower <comma> a  waterfall  shower <comma> and  actually <comma> all  those  knobs  beneath  are  also  showerheads <period> it  will  squirt  you  all  around  and  you  can  stay  in  that  shower  for  hours  -- <period> and  not  waste  water <comma> by  the  way <comma> because  it  recirculates  the  same  dirty  water <period> or  this <comma> this  is  a  really  neat  teapot  i  found  at  high  tea  at  the  four  seasons  hotel  in  chicago <period> it  's  a  ronnefeldt  tilting  teapot <period> that  's  kind  of  what  the  teapot  looks  like  but  the  way  you  use  it  is  you  lay  it  on  its  back <comma> and  you  put  tea  in <comma> and  then  you  fill  it  with  water <period> the  water  then  seeps  over  the  tea <period> and  the  tea  is  sitting  in  this  stuff  to  the  right <comma> the  tea  is  to  the  right  of  this  line <period> there  's  a  little  ledge  inside <comma> so  the  tea  is  sitting  there  and  the  water  is  filling  it  up  like  that <period> and  when  the  tea  is  ready <comma> or  almost  ready <comma> you  tilt  it <period> and  that  means  the  tea  is  partially  covered  while  it  completes  the  brewing <period> and  when  it  's  finished <comma> you  put  it  vertically <comma> and  now  the  tea  is <comma> you  remember <comma> above  this  line  and  the  water  only  comes  to  here <comma> and  so  it  keeps  the  tea  out <period> on  top  of  that <comma> it  communicates <comma> which  is  what  emotion  does <period> emotion  is  all  about  acting <period> emotion  is  really  about  acting <period> it  's  being  safe  in  the  world <period> cognition  is  about  understanding  the  world <comma> emotion  is  about  interpreting  it <comma> saying  good <comma> bad <comma> safe <comma> dangerous <comma> and  getting  us  ready  to  act <comma> which  is  why  the  muscles  tense  or  relax <period> and  that  's  why  we  can  tell  the  emotion  of  somebody  else <comma> because  their  muscles  are  acting <comma> subconsciously <comma> except  that  we've  evolved  to  make  the  facial  muscles  really  rich  with  emotion <period> well <comma> this  has  emotions  if  you  like <comma> because  it  signals  the  waiter  that <comma> hey <comma> i  'm  finished <period> see <comma> upright <period> and  the  waiter  can  come  by  and  say <comma> would  you  like  more  water <questionmark> it  's  kind  of  neat <period> what  a  wonderful  design <period> and  the  third  level  is  reflective <comma> which  is <comma> if  you  like  the  superego <comma> it  's  a  little  part  of  the  brain  that  has  no  control  over  what  you  do <comma> no  control  over  the <comma> does  n't  see  the  senses <comma> does  n't  control  the  muscles <period> it  looks  over  what  's  going  on <period> it  's  that  little  voice  in  your  head  that  's  watching  and  saying <comma> that  's  good <period> that  's  bad <period> or <comma> why  are  you  doing  that <questionmark> i  do  n't  understand <period> it  's  that  little  voice  in  your  head  that  's  the  seat  of  consciousness <period> here  's  a  great  reflective  product <period> owners  of  the  hummer  have  said <comma> you  know  i've  owned  many  cars  in  my  life <comma> all  sorts  of  exotic  cars <comma> but  never  have  i  had  a  car  that  attracted  so  much  attention <period> it  's  about  attention <period> it  's  about  their  image <comma> not  about  the  car <period> if  you  want  a  more  positive  model <comma> this  is  the  gm  car <period> and  the  reason  you  might  buy  it  now  is  because  you  care  about  the  environment <period> and  you  'll  buy  it  to  protect  the  environment <comma> even  though  the  first  few  cars  are  going  to  be  really  expensive  and  not  perfected <period> but  that  's  reflective  design  as  well <period> or  an  expensive  watch <comma> so  you  can  impress  people <comma> oh  gee <comma> i  did  n't  know  you  had  that  watch <period> as  opposed  to  this  one <comma> which  is  a  pure  behavioral  watch <comma> which  probably  keeps  better  time  than  the  $13,000  watch  i  just  showed  you <period> but  it  's  ugly <period> this  is  a  clear  don  norman  watch <period> and  what  's  neat  is  sometimes  you  pit  one  emotion  against  the  other <comma> the  visceral  fear  of  falling  against  the  reflective  state  saying <comma> it  's  ok <period> it  's  ok <period> it  's  safe <period> it  's  safe <period> if  that  amusement  park  were  rusty  and  falling  apart <comma> you'd  never  go  on  the  ride <period> so <comma> it  's  pitting  one  against  the  other <period> the  other  neat  thing <period> so  jake  cress  is  this  furniture  maker <comma> and  he  makes  this  unbelievable  set  of  furniture <period> and  this  is  his  chair  with  claw <comma> and  the  poor  little  chair  has  lost  its  ball  and  it  's  trying  to  get  it  back  before  anybody  notices <period> and  what  's  so  neat  about  it  is  how  you  accept  that  story <period> and  that  's  what  's  nice  about  emotion <period> so  that  's  the  new  me <period> i  'm  only  saying  positive  things  from  now  on <period> i  first  became  fascinated  with  octopus  at  an  early  age <period> i  grew  up  in  mobile <comma> alabama  -- <period> somebody  's  got  to  be  from  mobile <comma> right <questionmark> -- <period> and  mobile  sits  at  the  confluence  of  five  rivers <comma> forming  this  beautiful  delta <period> and  the  delta  has  alligators  crawling  in  and  out  of  rivers  filled  with  fish  and  cypress  trees  dripping  with  snakes <comma> birds  of  every  flavor <period> it  's  an  absolute  magical  wonderland  to  live  in <comma> if  you  're  a  kid  interested  in  animals <comma> to  grow  up  in <period> and  this  delta  water  flows  to  mobile  bay <comma> and  finally  into  the  gulf  of  mexico <period> and  i  remember  my  first  real  contact  with  octopus  was  probably  at  age  five  or  six <period> i  was  in  the  gulf <comma> and  i  was  swimming  around  and  saw  a  little  octopus  on  the  bottom <period> and  i  reached  down  and  picked  him  up <comma> and  immediately  became  fascinated  and  impressed  by  its  speed  and  its  strength  and  agility <period> it  was  prying  my  fingers  apart  and  moving  to  the  back  of  my  hand <period> it  was  all  i  could  do  to  hold  onto  this  amazing  creature <period> then  it  sort  of  calmed  down  in  the  palms  of  my  hands  and  started  flashing  colors <comma> just  pulsing  all  of  these  colors <period> and  as  i  looked  at  it <comma> it  kind  of  tucked  its  arms  under  it <comma> raised  into  a  spherical  shape  and  turned  chocolate  brown  with  two  white  stripes <period> i  'm  going <comma> my  gosh  i  had  never  seen  anything  like  this  in  my  life <period> so  i  marveled  for  a  moment <comma> and  then  decided  it  was  time  to  release  him <comma> so  i  put  him  down <period> the  octopus  left  my  hands  and  then  did  the  damnedest  thing: <period> it  landed  on  the  bottom  in  the  rubble  and <comma> fwoosh <comma> vanished  right  before  my  eyes <period> and  i  knew <comma> right  then <comma> at  age  six <comma> that  is  an  animal  that  i  want  to  learn  more  about <period> so  i  did <period> and  i  went  off  to  college  and  got  a  degree  in  marine  zoology <comma> and  then  moved  to  hawaii  and  entered  graduate  school  at  the  university  of  hawaii <period> and  while  a  student  at  hawaii <comma> i  worked  at  the  waikiki  aquarium <period> and  the  aquarium  had  a  lot  of  big  fish  tanks  but  not  a  lot  of  invertebrate  displays <comma> and  being  the  spineless  guy <comma> i  thought <comma> well  i  'll  just  go  out  in  the  field  and  collect  these  wonderful  animals  i  had  been  learning  about  as  a  student  and  bring  them  in <comma> and  i  built  these  elaborate  sets  and  put  them  on  display <period> now <comma> the  fish  in  the  tanks  were  gorgeous  to  look  at <comma> but  they  did  n't  really  interact  with  people <period> but  the  octopus  did <period> if  you  walked  up  to  an  octopus  tank <comma> especially  early  in  the  morning  before  anyone  arrived <comma> the  octopus  would  rise  up  and  look  at  you  and  you  're  thinking <comma> is  that  guy  really  looking  at  me <questionmark> he  is  looking  at  me  and  you  walk  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank <period> then  you  realize  that  these  animals  all  have  different  personalities: <period> some  of  them  would  hold  their  ground <period> others  would  slink  into  the  back  of  the  tank  and  disappear  in  the  rocks <period> and  one  in  particular <comma> this  amazing  animal <period> i  went  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank <comma> and  he  's  just  staring  at  me <period> and  he  had  little  horns  come  up  above  his  eyes <period> so  i  went  right  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank  -- <period> i  was  three  or  four  inches  from  the  front  glass  -- <period> and  the  octopus  was  sitting  on  a  perch <comma> a  little  rock <comma> and  he  came  off  the  rock  and  he  also  came  down  right  to  the  front  of  the  glass <period> so  i  was  staring  at  this  animal  about  six  or  seven  inches  away <comma> and  at  that  time  i  could  actually  focus  that  close <period> now  as  i  look  at  my  fuzzy  fingers  i  realize  those  days  are  long  gone <period> anyway <comma> there  we  were <comma> staring  at  each  other <comma> and  he  reaches  down  and  grabs  an  armful  of  gravel  and  releases  it  in  the  jet  of  water  entering  the  tank  from  the  filtration  system <comma> and <comma> chk  chk  chk  chk  chk <comma> this  gravel  hits  the  front  of  the  glass  and  falls  down <period> he  reaches  up <comma> takes  another  armful  of  gravel <comma> releases  it <comma> chk  chk  chk  chk  chk <comma> same  thing <period> then  he  lifts  another  arm  and  i  lift  an  arm <period> then  he  lifts  another  arm  and  i  lift  another  arm <period> and  then  i  realize  the  octopus  won  the  arms  race <comma> because  i  was  out  and  he  had  six  left <period> but  the  only  way  i  can  describe  what  i  was  seeing  that  day  was  that  this  octopus  was  playing <comma> which  is  a  pretty  sophisticated  behavior  for  a  mere  invertebrate <period> so <comma> about  three  years  into  my  degree <comma> a  funny  thing  happened  on  the  way  to  the  office <comma> which  actually  changed  the  course  of  my  life <period> a  man  came  into  the  aquarium <period> it  's  a  long  story <comma> but  essentially  he  sent  me  and  a  couple  of  friends  of  mine  to  the  south  pacific  to  collect  animals  for  him <comma> and  as  we  left <comma> he  gave  us  two  16-millimeter  movie  cameras <period> he  said <comma> make  a  movie  about  this  expedition  ok <comma> a  couple  of  biologists  making  a  movie <comma> this  'll  be  interesting <period> and  off  we  went <period> and  we  did <comma> we  made  a  movie <comma> which  had  to  be  the  worst  movie  ever  made  in  the  history  of  movie  making <period> but  it  was  a  blast <period> i  had  so  much  fun <period> and  i  remember  that  proverbial  light  going  off  in  my  head <comma> thinking <comma> wait  a  minute <period> maybe  i  can  do  this  all  the  time <period> yeah <comma> i  'll  be  a  filmmaker  so  i  literally  came  back  from  that  job <comma> quit  school <comma> hung  my  filmmaking  shingle  and  just  never  told  anyone  that  i  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing <period> it  's  been  a  good  ride <period> and  what  i  learned  in  school  though  was  really  beneficial <period> if  you  're  a  wildlife  filmmaker  and  you  're  going  out  into  the  field  to  film  animals <comma> especially  behavior <comma> it  helps  to  have  a  fundamental  background  on  who  these  animals  are <comma> how  they  work  and <comma> you  know <comma> a  bit  about  their  behaviors <period> but  where  i  really  learned  about  octopus  was  in  the  field <comma> as  a  filmmaker  making  films  with  them <comma> where  you  're  allowed  to  spend  large  periods  of  time  with  the  animals <comma> seeing  octopus  being  octopus  in  their  ocean  homes <period> i  remember  i  took  a  trip  to  australia <comma> went  to  an  island  called  one  tree  island <period> and  apparently <comma> evolution  had  occurred  at  a  pretty  rapid  rate  on  one  tree <period> between  the  time  they  named  it  and  the  time  i  arrived <comma> because  i  'm  sure  there  were  at  least  three  trees  on  that  island  when  we  were  there <period> anyway <comma> one  tree  is  situated  right  next  to  a  beautiful  coral  reef <period> in  fact <comma> there  's  a  surge  channel  where  the  tide  is  moving  back  and  forth <comma> twice  a  day <comma> pretty  rapidly <period> and  there  's  a  beautiful  reef <comma> very  complex  reef <comma> with  lots  of  animals <comma> including  a  lot  of  octopus <period> and  not  uniquely  but  certainly <comma> the  octopus  in  australia  are  masters  at  camouflage <period> as  a  matter  of  fact <comma> there  's  one  right  there <period> so  our  first  challenge  was  to  find  these  things <comma> and  that  was  a  challenge <comma> indeed <period> but  the  idea  is <comma> we  were  there  for  a  month  and  i  wanted  to  acclimate  the  animals  to  us <period> so  that  we  could  see  behaviors  without  disturbing  them <period> so  the  first  week  was  pretty  much  spent  just  getting  as  close  as  we  could <comma> every  day  a  little  closer <comma> a  little  closer <comma> a  little  closer <period> and  you  knew  what  the  limit  was <comma> they  would  start  getting  twitchy  and  you'd  back  up <comma> come  back  in  a  few  hours <period> and  after  the  first  week <comma> they  ignored  us <period> it  was  like <comma> i  do  n't  know  what  that  thing  is <comma> but  he  's  no  threat  to  me  so  they  went  on  about  their  business <period> and  from  a  foot  away <comma> we  're  watching  mating  and  courting  and  fighting  and  it  is  just  an  unbelievable  experience <period> and  one  of  the  most  fantastic  displays  that  i  remember <comma> or  at  least  visually <comma> was  a  foraging  behavior <period> and  they  had  a  lot  of  different  techniques  that  they  would  use  for  foraging <period> but  this  particular  one  used  vision <period> and  they  would  see  a  coral  head <comma> maybe  10  feet  away <comma> and  start  moving  over  toward  that  coral  head <period> and  i  do  n't  know  whether  they  actually  saw  crab  in  it <comma> or  imagined  that  one  might  be <comma> but  whatever  the  case <comma> they  would  leap  off  the  bottom  and  go  through  the  water  and  land  right  on  top  of  this  coral  head <comma> and  then  the  web  between  the  arms  would  completely  engulf  the  coral  head <comma> and  they  would  fish  out <comma> swim  for  crabs <period> and  as  soon  as  the  crabs  touched  the  arm <comma> it  was  lights  out <period> and  i  always  wondered  what  happened  under  that  web <period> so  we  created  a  way  to  find  out <period> and  i  got  my  first  look  at  that  famous  beak  in  action <period> it  was  fantastic <period> if  you  're  going  to  make  a  lot  of  films  about  a  particular  group  of  animals <comma> you  might  as  well  pick  one  that  's  fairly  common <period> and  octopus  are <comma> they  live  in  all  the  oceans <period> they  also  live  deep <period> and  i  cannot  say  octopus  are  responsible  for  my  really  strong  interest  in  getting  in  subs  and  going  deep <comma> but  whatever  the  case <comma> i  like  that <period> it  's  like  nothing  you've  ever  done <period> if  you  ever  really  want  to  get  away  from  it  all  and  see  something  that  you  have  never  seen <comma> and  have  an  excellent  chance  of  seeing  something  no  one  has  ever  seen <comma> get  in  a  sub <period> you  climb  in <comma> seal  the  hatch <comma> turn  on  a  little  oxygen <comma> turn  on  the  scrubber <comma> which  removes  the  co2  in  the  air  you  breathe <comma> and  they  chuck  you  overboard <period> down  you  go <period> there  's  no  connection  to  the  surface  apart  from  a  pretty  funky  radio <period> and  as  you  go  down <comma> the  washing  machine  at  the  surface  calms  down <period> and  it  gets  quiet <period> and  it  starts  getting  really  nice <period> and  as  you  go  deeper <comma> that  lovely <comma> blue  water  you  were  launched  in  gives  way  to  darker  and  darker  blue <period> and  finally <comma> it  's  a  rich  lavender <comma> and  after  a  couple  of  thousand  feet <comma> it  's  ink  black <period> and  now  you've  entered  the  realm  of  the  mid-water  community <period> you  could  give  an  entire  talk  about  the  creatures  that  live  in  the  mid-water <period> suffice  to  say  though <comma> as  far  as  i  'm  concerned <comma> without  question <comma> the  most  bizarre  designs  and  outrageous  behaviors  are  in  the  animals  that  live  in  the  mid-water  community <period> but  we  're  just  going  to  zip  right  past  this  area <comma> this  area  that  includes  about  95  percent  of  the  living  space  on  our  planet  and  go  to  the  mid-ocean  ridge <comma> which  i  think  is  even  more  extraordinary <period> the  mid-ocean  ridge  is  a  huge  mountain  range <comma> 40,000  miles  long <comma> snaking  around  the  entire  globe <period> and  they  're  big  mountains <comma> thousands  of  feet  tall <comma> some  of  which  are  tens  of  thousands  of  feet  and  bust  through  the  surface <comma> creating  islands  like  hawaii <period> and  the  top  of  this  mountain  range  is  splitting  apart <comma> creating  a  rift  valley <period> and  when  you  dive  into  that  rift  valley <comma> that  's  where  the  action  is  because  literally  thousands  of  active  volcanoes  are  going  off  at  any  point  in  time  all  along  this  40,000  mile  range <period> and  as  these  tectonic  plates  are  spreading  apart <comma> magma <comma> lava  is  coming  up  and  filling  those  gaps <period> and  you  're  looking  land <comma> new  land <comma> being  created  right  before  your  eyes <period> and  over  the  tops  of  them  is  3,000  to  4,000  meters  of  water  creating  enormous  pressure <comma> forcing  water  down  through  the  cracks  toward  the  center  of  the  earth <comma> until  it  hits  a  magma  chamber  where  it  becomes  superheated  and  supersaturated  with  minerals <comma> reverses  its  flow  and  starts  shooting  back  to  the  surface  and  is  ejected  out  of  the  earth  like  a  geyser  at  yellowstone <period> in  fact <comma> this  whole  area  is  like  a  yellowstone  national  park  with  all  of  the  trimmings <period> and  this  vent  fluid  is  about  600  or  700  degrees  f <period> the  surrounding  water  is  just  a  couple  of  degrees  above  freezing <period> so  it  immediately  cools <comma> and  it  can  no  longer  hold  in  suspension  all  of  the  material  that  it  's  dissolved <comma> and  it  precipitates  out <comma> forming  black  smoke <period> and  it  forms  these  towers <comma> these  chimneys  that  are  10 <comma> 20 <comma> 30  feet  tall <period> and  all  along  the  sides  of  these  chimneys  is  shimmering  with  heat  and  loaded  with  life <period> you've  got  black  smokers  going  all  over  the  place  and  chimneys  that  have  tube  worms  that  might  be  eight  to  10  feet  long <period> and  out  of  the  tops  of  these  tube  worms  are  these  beautiful  red  plumes <period> and  living  amongst  the  tangle  of  tube  worms  is  an  entire  community  of  animals <comma> shrimp <comma> fish <comma> lobsters <comma> crab <comma> clams  and  swarms  of  arthropods  that  are  playing  that  dangerous  game  between  over  here  is  scalding  hot  and  freezing  cold <period> and  this  whole  ecosystem  was  n't  even  known  about  until  33  years  ago <period> and  it  completely  threw  science  on  its  head <period> it  made  scientists  rethink  where  life  on  earth  might  have  actually  begun <period> and  before  the  discovery  of  these  vents <comma> all  life  on  earth <comma> the  key  to  life  on  earth <comma> was  believed  to  be  the  sun  and  photosynthesis <period> but  down  there <comma> there  is  no  sun <comma> there  is  no  photosynthesis <period> it  's  chemosynthetic  environment  down  there  driving  it <comma> and  it  's  all  so  ephemeral <period> you  might  film  this  unbelievable  hydrothermal  vent <comma> which  you  think  at  the  time  has  to  be  on  another  planet <period> it  's  amazing  to  think  that  this  is  actually  on  earth <period> it  looks  like  aliens  in  an  alien  environment <period> but  you  go  back  to  the  same  vent  eight  years  later  and  it  can  be  completely  dead <period> there  's  no  hot  water <period> all  of  the  animals  are  gone <comma> they  're  dead <period> and  the  chimneys  are  still  there  creating  a  really  nice  ghost  town <comma> an  eerie <comma> spooky  ghost  town <comma> but  essentially  devoid  of  animals <comma> of  course <period> but  10  miles  down  the  ridge <period> pshhh <period> there  's  another  volcano  going <period> and  there  's  a  whole  new  hydrothermal  vent  community  that  has  been  formed <period> and  this  kind  of  life  and  death  of  hydrothermal  vent  communities  is  going  on  every  30  or  40  years  all  along  the  ridge <period> and  that  ephemeral  nature  of  the  hydrothermal  vent  community  is  n't  really  different  from  some  of  the  areas  that  i've  seen  in  35  years  of  traveling  around <comma> making  films <period> where  you  go  and  film  a  really  nice  sequence  at  a  bay <period> and  you  go  back <comma> and  i  'm  at  home <comma> and  i  'm  thinking <comma> okay <comma> what  can  i  shoot <period> ah <period> i  know  where  i  can  shoot  that <period> there  's  this  beautiful  bay <comma> lots  of  soft  corals  and  stomatopods  and  you  show  up <comma> and  it  's  dead <period> there  's  no  coral <comma> algae  growing  on  it <comma> and  the  water  's  pea  soup <period> you  think <comma> well <comma> what  happened  and  you  turn  around <comma> and  there  's  a  hillside  behind  you  with  a  neighborhood  going  in <comma> and  bulldozers  are  pushing  piles  of  soil  back  and  forth <period> and  over  here  there  's  a  golf  course  going  in <period> and  this  is  the  tropics <period> it  's  raining  like  crazy  here <period> so  this  rainwater  is  flooding  down  the  hillside <comma> carrying  with  it  sediments  from  the  construction  site <comma> smothering  the  coral  and  killing  it <period> and  fertilizers  and  pesticides  are  flowing  into  the  bay  from  the  golf  course  -- <period> the  pesticides  killing  all  the  larvae  and  little  animals <comma> fertilizer  creating  this  beautiful  plankton  bloom  -- <period> and  there  's  your  pea  soup <period> but <comma> encouragingly <comma> i've  seen  just  the  opposite <period> i've  been  to  a  place  that  was  a  pretty  trashed  bay <period> and  i  looked  at  it <comma> just  said <comma> yuck <comma> and  go  and  work  on  the  other  side  of  the  island <period> five  years  later <comma> come  back <comma> and  that  same  bay  is  now  gorgeous <period> it  's  beautiful <period> it  's  got  living  coral <comma> fish  all  over  the  place <comma> crystal  clear  water <comma> and  you  go <comma> how  did  that  happen  well <comma> how  it  happened  is  the  local  community  galvanized <period> they  recognized  what  was  happening  on  the  hillside  and  put  a  stop  to  it <period> enacted  laws  and  made  permits  required  to  do  responsible  construction  and  golf  course  maintenance  and  stopped  the  sediments  flowing  into  the  bay <comma> and  stopped  the  chemicals  flowing  into  the  bay <comma> and  the  bay  recovered <period> the  ocean  has  an  amazing  ability  to  recover <comma> if  we  'll  just  leave  it  alone <period> i  think  margaret  mead  said  it  best <period> she  said  that  a  small  group  of  thoughtful  people  could  change  the  world <period> indeed <comma> it  's  the  only  thing  that  ever  has <period> and  a  small  group  of  thoughtful  people  changed  that  bay <period> i  'm  a  big  fan  of  grassroots  organizations <period> i've  been  to  a  lot  of  lectures  where <comma> at  the  end  of  it <comma> inevitably <comma> one  of  the  first  questions  that  comes  up  is <comma> but <comma> but  what  can  i  do <questionmark> i  'm  an  individual <period> i  'm  one  person <period> and  these  problems  are  so  large  and  global <comma> and  it  's  just  overwhelming  fair  enough  question <period> my  answer  to  that  is  do  n't  look  at  the  big <comma> overwhelming  issues  of  the  world <period> look  in  your  own  backyard <period> look  in  your  heart <comma> actually <period> what  do  you  really  care  about  that  is  n't  right  where  you  live <questionmark> and  fix  it <period> create  a  healing  zone  in  your  neighborhood  and  encourage  others  to  do  the  same <period> and  maybe  these  healing  zones  can  sprinkle  a  map <comma> little  dots  on  a  map <period> and  in  fact <comma> the  way  that  we  can  communicate  today <comma> where  alaska  is  instantly  knowing  what  's  going  on  in  china <comma> and  the  kiwis  did  this <comma> and  then  over  in  england  they  tried  to <period> and  everybody  is  talking  to  everyone  else  -- <period> it  's  not  isolated  points  on  a  map  anymore <comma> it  's  a  network  we've  created <period> and  maybe  these  healing  zones  can  start  growing <comma> and  possibly  even  overlap <comma> and  good  things  can  happen <period> so  that  's  how  i  answer  that  question <period> look  in  your  own  backyard <comma> in  fact <comma> look  in  the  mirror <period> what  can  you  do  that  is  more  responsible  than  what  you  're  doing  now <questionmark> and  do  that <comma> and  spread  the  word <period> the  vent  community  animals  cannot  really  do  much  about  the  life  and  death  that  's  going  on  where  they  live <comma> but  up  here  we  can <period> in  theory <comma> we  're  thinking <comma> rational  human  beings <period> and  we  can  make  changes  to  our  behavior  that  will  influence  and  affect  the  environment <comma> like  those  people  changed  the  health  of  that  bay <period> now <comma> sylvia  's  ted  prize  wish  was  to  beseech  us  to  do  anything  we  could <comma> everything  we  could <comma> to  set  aside  not  pin  pricks <comma> but  significant  expanses  of  the  ocean  for  preservation <comma> hope  spots <comma> she  calls  them <period> and  i  applaud  that <period> i  loudly  applaud  that <period> and  it  's  my  hope  that  some  of  these  hope  spots  can  be  in  the  deep  ocean <comma> an  area  that  has  historically  been  seriously  neglected <comma> if  not  abused <period> the  term  deep  six  comes  to  mind: <period> if  it  's  too  big  or  too  toxic  for  a  landfill <comma> deep  six  it <period> so <comma> i  hope  that  we  can  also  keep  some  of  these  hope  spots  in  the  deep  sea <period> now <comma> i  do  n't  get  a  wish <comma> but  i  certainly  can  say  that  i  will  do  anything  i  can  to  support  sylvia  earle  's  wish <period> and  that  i  do <period> thank  you  very  much <period> i  'm  going  to  share  with  you  the  story  as  to  how  i  have  become  an  hiv/aids  campaigner <period> and  this  is  the  name  of  my  campaign <comma> sing  campaign <period> in  november  of  2003 <comma> i  was  invited  to  take  part  in  the  launch  of  nelson  mandela  's  46664  foundation  -- <period> that  is  his  hiv/aids  foundation <period> and  46664  is  the  number  that  mandela  had  when  he  was  imprisoned  in  robben  island <period> and  that  's  me  with  youssou  n'dour <comma> onstage <comma> having  the  time  of  my  life <period> the  next  day <comma> all  the  artists  were  invited  to  join  mandela  in  robben  island <comma> where  he  was  going  to  give  a  conference  to  the  world  's  press <comma> standing  in  front  of  his  former  prison  cell <period> you  can  see  the  bars  of  the  window  there <period> it  was  quite  a  momentous  occasion  for  all  of  us <period> in  that  moment  in  time <comma> mandela  told  the  world  's  press  that  there  was  a  virtual  genocide  taking  place  in  his  country <period> that  post-apartheid  rainbow  nation <comma> a  thousand  people  were  dying  on  a  daily  basis  and  that  the  front  line  victims <comma> the  most  vulnerable  of  all <comma> were  women  and  children <period> this  was  a  huge  impact  on  my  mind <period> because  i  am  a  woman  and  i  am  a  mother <comma> and  i  had  n't  realized  that  the  hiv/aids  pandemic  was  directly  affecting  women  in  such  a  way <period> and  so  i  committed <comma> when  i  left  south  africa <comma> when  i  left  capetown <comma> i  told  myself <comma> this  is  going  to  be  something  that  i  have  to  talk  about <period> i  have  to  serve  and  so <comma> subsequently  i  participated  in  every  single  46664  event  that  i  could  take  part  in  and  gave  news  conferences <comma> interviews <comma> talking  and  using  my  platform  as  a  musician <comma> with  my  commitment  to  mandela <comma> out  of  respect  for  the  tremendous <comma> unbelievable  work  that  he  had  done <period> everyone  in  the  world  respects  nelson  mandela <period> everyone  reveres  nelson  mandela <period> but  do  they  all  know  about  what  has  been  taking  place  in  south  africa <comma> his  country <comma> the  country  that  had  one  of  the  highest  incidents  of  transmission  of  the  virus <questionmark> i  think  that  if  i  went  out  into  the  street  now  and  i  told  people  what  was  happening  there <comma> they  would  be  shocked <period> i  was  very <comma> very  fortunate  a  couple  of  years  later  to  have  met  zackie  achmat <comma> the  founder  of  treatment  action  campaign <comma> an  incredible  campaigner  and  activist <period> i  met  him  at  a  46664  event <period> he  was  wearing  a  t-shirt  like  the  one  i  wear  now <period> this  is  a  tool  -- <period> this  tells  you  i  am  in  solidarity  with  people  who  have  hiv <comma> people  who  are  living  with  hiv <period> and  in  a  way  because  of  the  stigma <comma> by  wearing  this  t-shirt  i  say <comma> yes <comma> we  can  talk  about  this  issue <period> it  does  n't  have  to  be  in  the  closet  i  became  a  member  of  treatment  action  campaign  and  i  'm  very  proud  to  be  a  member  of  that  incredible  organization <period> it  's  a  grassroots  campaign  with  80  percent  membership  being  women <comma> most  of  whom  are  hiv-positive <period> they  work  in  the  field <period> they  have  tremendous  outreach  to  the  people  who  are  living  directly  with  the  effects  of  the  virus <period> they  have  education  programs <period> they  bring  out  the  issues  of  stigma <period> it  's  quite  extraordinary  what  they  do <period> and  yes <comma> my  sing  campaign  has  supported  treatment  action  campaign  in  the  way  that  i  have  tried  to  raise  awareness  and  to  try  to  also  raise  funds <period> a  lot  of  the  funding  that  i  have  managed  to  raise  has  gone  directly  to  treatment  action  campaign  and  the  incredible  work  that  they  do <comma> and  are  still  continuing  to  do  in  south  africa <period> so  this  is  my  sing  campaign <period> sing  campaign  is  basically  just  me  and  about  three  or  four  wonderful  people  who  help  to  support  me <period> i've  traveled  all  over  the  world  in  the  last  two  and  a  half  years  -- <period> i  went  to  about  12  different  countries <period> here  i  am  in  oslo  in  norway <comma> getting  a  nice <comma> fat  check <period> singing  in  hong  kong <comma> trying  to  get  people  to  raise  money <period> in  johannesburg <comma> i  had  the  opportunity  to  play  to  a  mainly  white <comma> middle-class  south  african  audience  who  ended  up  in  tears  because  i  use  film  clips  that  really  touch  the  heart <comma> the  whole  nature <comma> of  this  terrible  tragedy  that  is  taking  place <comma> that  people  are  tending  to  avoid <comma> because  they  are  fatigued <comma> and  they  really  do  n't  quite  know  what  the  solutions  are <period> aaron  motsoaledi <comma> the  current  health  minister <comma> attended  that  concert  and  i  had  an  opportunity  to  meet  with  him <comma> and  he  gave  his  absolute  commitment  to  try  to  making  a  change <comma> which  is  absolutely  necessary <period> this  is  in  the  scottish  parliament <period> i've  subsequently  become  an  envoy  for  scotland  and  hiv <period> and  i  was  showing  them  my  experiences  and  trying  to <comma> again <comma> raise  awareness <period> and  once  again <comma> in  edinburgh  with  the  wonderful  african  children  's  choir  who  i  simply  adore <period> and  it  's  children  like  this <comma> many  of  whom  have  been  orphaned  because  of  their  family  being  affected  by  the  aids  virus <period> i  'm  sitting  here  in  new  york  with  michel  sidibe  -- <period> he  's  the  director  of  unaids <period> and  i  'm  very  honored  by  the  fact  that  michel  invited  me <comma> only  a  few  months  ago <comma> to  become  a  unaids  ambassador <period> and  in  this  way <comma> i've  been  strengthening  my  platform  and  broadening  my  outreach <period> the  message  that  unaids  are  currently  sending  out  to  the  world  is  that  we  would  like  to  see  the  virtual  elimination  of  the  transmission  of  the  virus  from  mother  to  child  by  2015 <period> it  's  a  very  ambitious  goal  but  we  believe  it  can  be  achieved  with  political  will <period> this  can  happen <period> and  here  i  am  with  a  pregnant  woman <comma> who  is  hiv  positive  and  we  're  smiling <comma> both  of  us  are  smiling <comma> because  we  're  very  confident <comma> because  we  know  that  that  young  woman  is  receiving  treatment  so  her  life  can  be  extended  to  take  care  of  the  baby  she  's  about  to  give  birth  to <period> and  her  baby  will  receive  pmtct <comma> which  will  mean  that  that  baby  can  be  born  free  of  the  virus <period> now  that  is  prevention  at  the  very  beginning  of  life <period> it  's  one  way  to  start  looking  at  intervention  with  the  aids  pandemic <period> now <comma> i  just  would  like  to  finish  off  to  tell  you  the  little  story  about  avelile <period> this  is  avelile  -- <period> she  goes  with  me  wherever  i  go <period> i  tell  her  story  to  everyone  because  she  represents  one  of  millions  of  hiv/aids  orphans <period> avelile  's  mother  had  hiv  virus  -- <period> she  died  from  aids-related  illness <period> avelile  had  the  virus <period> she  was  born  with  the  virus <period> and  here  she  is  at  seven  years  old <comma> weighing  no  more  than  a  one  year-old  baby <period> at  this  point  in  her  life <comma> she  's  suffering  with  full-blown  aids  and  had  pneumonia <period> we  met  her  in  a  hospital  in  the  eastern  cape  and  spent  a  whole  afternoon  with  her <comma> an  adorable  child <period> the  doctors  and  nurses  were  phenomenal <period> they  put  her  on  very  special  nutritious  diet  and  took  great  care  of  her <period> and  we  did  n't  know  when  we  left  the  hospital <comma> because  we  filmed  her  story <comma> we  did  n't  know  if  she  was  going  to  survive <period> so <comma> it  was  obviously <comma> it  was  a  very  emotional  encounter  and  left  us  feeling  very  resonant  with  this  direct  experience <comma> this  one  child <comma> you  know <comma> that  story <period> five  months  later <comma> we  went  back  to  south  africa  to  meet  avelile  again <period> and  i  'm  getting <comma> the  hairs  on  my <comma> i  do  n't  know  if  you  can  see  the  hairs  on  my  arms <period> they  're  standing  up  because  i  know  what  i  'm  going  to  show  you <period> this  is  the  transformation  that  took  place <period> is  n't  it  extraordinary <questionmark> that  round  of  applause  is  actually  for  the  doctors  and  nurses  of  the  hospital  who  took  care  of  avelile <period> and  i  take  it  that  you  appreciate  that  kind  of  transformation <period> so <comma> i  would  like  to  say  to  you <comma> each  one  in  the  audience <comma> if  you  feel  that  every  mother  and  every  child  in  the  world  has  the  right  to  have  access  to  good  nutrition  and  good  medical  care <comma> and  you  believe  that  the  millennium  development  goals <comma> specifically  five  and  six <comma> should  be  absolutely  committed  to  by  all  governments  around  the  world <comma> especially  in  sub-saharan  africa <comma> could  you  please  stand  up <period> i  think  that  's  fair  to  say <comma> it  's  almost  everyone  in  the  hall <period> thank  you  very  much <period> as  a  boy <comma> i  loved  cars <period> when  i  turned  18 <comma> i  lost  my  best  friend  to  a  car  accident <period> like  this <period> and  then  i  decided  i'd  dedicate  my  life  to  saving  one  million  people  every  year <period> now  i  have  n't  succeeded <comma> so  this  is  just  a  progress  report <comma> but  i  'm  here  to  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  self-driving  cars <period> i  saw  the  concept  first  in  the  darpa  grand  challenges  where  the  us <period> government  issued  a  prize  to  build  a  self-driving  car  that  could  navigate  a  desert <period> and  even  though  a  hundred  teams  were  there <comma> these  cars  went  nowhere <period> so  we  decided  at  stanford  to  build  a  different  self-driving  car <period> we  built  the  hardware  and  the  software <period> we  made  it  learn  from  us <comma> and  we  set  it  free  in  the  desert <period> and  the  unimaginable  happened <comma> it  became  the  first  car  to  ever  return  from  a  darpa  grand  challenge <comma> winning  stanford  2  million  dollars <period> yet  i  still  had  n't  saved  a  single  life <period> since <comma> our  work  has  focused  on  building  driving  cars  that  can  drive  anywhere  by  themselves <comma> any  street  in  california <period> we've  driven  140,000  miles <period> our  cars  have  sensors  by  which  they  magically  can  see  everything  around  them  and  make  decisions  about  every  aspect  of  driving <period> it  's  the  perfect  driving  mechanism <period> we've  driven  in  cities <comma> like  in  san  francisco  here <period> we've  driven  from  san  francisco  to  los  angeles  on  highway  1 <period> we've  encountered  joggers <comma> busy  highways <comma> toll  booths <comma> and  this  is  without  a  person  in  the  loop <period> the  car  just  drives  itself <period> in  fact <comma> while  we  drove  140,000  miles <comma> people  did  n't  even  notice <period> mountain  roads <comma> day  and  night <comma> and  even  crooked  lombard  street  in  san  francisco <period> sometimes  our  cars  get  so  crazy <comma> they  even  do  little  stunts <period> man <comma> oh <comma> my  god <period> what <questionmark> second  man <comma> it  's  driving  itself <period> sebastian  thrun <comma> now  i  cannot  get  my  friend  harold  back  to  life <period> but  i  can  do  something  for  all  the  people  who  died <period> do  you  know  that  driving  accidents  are  the  number  one  cause  of  death  for  young  people <questionmark> and  do  you  realize  that  almost  all  of  those  are  due  to  human  error  and  not  machine  error <comma> and  can  therefore  be  prevented  by  machines <questionmark> do  you  realize  that  we  could  change  the  capacity  of  highways  by  a  factor  of  two  or  three  if  we  did  n't  rely  on  human  precision  on  staying  in  the  lane <comma> improve  body  position  and  therefore  drive  a  little  bit  closer  together  on  a  little  bit  narrower  lanes <comma> and  do  away  with  all  traffic  jams  on  highways <questionmark> do  you  realize  that  you <comma> ted  users <comma> spend  an  average  of  52  minutes  per  day  in  traffic <comma> wasting  your  time  on  your  daily  commute <questionmark> you  could  regain  this  time <period> this  is  four  billion  hours  wasted  in  this  country  alone <period> and  it  's  24  billion  gallons  of  gasoline  wasted <period> now  i  think  there  's  a  vision  here <comma> a  new  technology <comma> and  i  'm  really  looking  forward  to  a  time  when  generations  after  us  look  back  at  us  and  say  how  ridiculous  it  was  that  humans  were  driving  cars <period> thank  you <period> it  is  a  dream  of  mankind  to  fly  like  a  bird <period> birds  are  very  agile <period> they  fly <comma> not  with  rotating  components <comma> so  they  fly  only  by  flapping  their  wings <period> so  we  looked  at  the  birds <comma> and  we  tried  to  make  a  model  that  is  powerful <comma> ultralight <comma> and  it  must  have  excellent  aerodynamic  qualities  that  would  fly  by  its  own  and  only  by  flapping  its  wings <period> so  what  would  be  better  than  to  use  the  herring  gull <comma> in  its  freedom <comma> circling  and  swooping  over  the  sea <comma> and  to  use  this  as  a  role  model <questionmark> so  we  bring  a  team  together <period> there  are  generalists  and  also  specialists  in  the  field  of  aerodynamics  in  the  field  of  building  gliders <period> and  the  task  was  to  build  an  ultralight  indoor-flying  model  that  is  able  to  fly  over  your  heads <period> so  be  careful  later  on <period> and  this  was  one  issue <comma> to  build  it  that  lightweight  that  no  one  would  be  hurt  if  it  fell  down <period> so  why  do  we  do  all  this <questionmark> we  are  a  company  in  the  field  of  automation <comma> and  we'd  like  to  do  very  lightweight  structures  because  that  's  energy  efficient <period> and  we'd  like  to  learn  more  about  pneumatics  and  air  flow  phenomena <period> so  i  now  would  like  you  to  put  your  seat  belts  on  and  put  your  hats  on <period> so  maybe  we  'll  try  it  once <comma> to  fly  a  smartbird <period> thank  you <period> so  we  can  now  look  at  the  smartbird <period> so  here  is  one  without  a  skin <period> we  have  a  wingspan  of  about  two  meters <period> the  length  is  one  meter  and  six <comma> and  the  weight <comma> it  is  only  450  grams <period> and  it  is  all  out  of  carbon  fiber <period> in  the  middle  we  have  a  motor <comma> and  we  also  have  a  gear  in  it <period> and  we  use  the  gear  to  transfer  the  circulation  of  the  motor <period> so  within  the  motor <comma> we  have  three  hall  sensors <comma> so  we  know  exactly  where  the  wing  is <period> and  if  we  now  beat  up  and  down <period> we  have  the  possibility  to  fly  like  a  bird <period> so  if  you  go  down <comma> you  have  the  large  area  of  propulsion <period> and  if  you  go  up <comma> the  wings  are  not  that  large <comma> and  it  is  easier  to  get  up <period> so <comma> the  next  thing  we  did <comma> or  the  challenges  we  did <comma> was  to  coordinate  this  movement <period> we  have  to  turn  it <comma> go  up  and  go  down <period> we  have  a  split  wing <period> with  a  split  wing  we  get  the  lift  at  the  upper  wing <comma> and  we  get  the  propulsion  at  the  lower  wing <period> also <comma> we  see  how  we  measure  the  aerodynamic  efficiency <period> we  had  knowledge  about  the  electromechanical  efficiency  and  then  we  can  calculate  the  aerodynamic  efficiency <period> so  therefore <comma> it  rises  up  from  passive  torsion  to  active  torsion <comma> from  30  percent  up  to  80  percent <period> next  thing  we  have  to  do <comma> we  have  to  control  and  regulate  the  whole  structure <period> only  if  you  control  and  regulate  it <comma> you  will  get  that  aerodynamic  efficiency <period> so  the  overall  consumption  of  energy  is  about  25  watts  at  takeoff  and  16  to  18  watts  in  flight <period> thank  you <period> bruno  giussani <comma> markus <comma> i  think  that  we  should  fly  it  once  more <period> markus  fischer <comma> yeah <comma> sure <period> whoa <comma> dude <period> check  out  those  killer  equations <period> sweet <period> actually <comma> for  the  next  18  minutes  i  'm  going  to  do  the  best  i  can  to  describe  the  beauty  of  particle  physics  without  equations <period> it  turns  out  there  's  a  lot  we  can  learn  from  coral <period> coral  is  a  very  beautiful  and  unusual  animal <period> each  coral  head  consists  of  thousand  of  individual  polyps <period> these  polyps  are  continually  budding  and  branching  into  genetically  identical  neighbors <period> if  we  imagine  this  to  be  a  hyper-intelligent  coral <comma> we  can  single  out  an  individual  and  ask  him  a  reasonable  question <period> we  can  ask  how  exactly  he  got  to  be  in  this  particular  location  compared  to  his  neighbors  -- <period> if  it  was  just  chance <comma> or  destiny <comma> or  what <questionmark> now <comma> after  admonishing  us  for  turning  the  temperature  up  too  high <comma> he  would  tell  us  that  our  question  was  completely  stupid <period> these  corals  can  be  quite  kind  of  mean <comma> you  see <comma> and  i  have  surfing  scars  to  prove  that <period> but  this  polyp  would  continue  and  tell  us  that  his  neighbors  were  quite  clearly  identical  copies  of  him <period> that  he  was  in  all  these  other  locations  as  well <comma> but  experiencing  them  as  separate  individuals <period> for  a  coral <comma> branching  into  different  copies  is  the  most  natural  thing  in  the  world <period> unlike  us <comma> a  hyper-intelligent  coral  would  be  uniquely  prepared  to  understand  quantum  mechanics <period> the  mathematics  of  quantum  mechanics  very  accurately  describes  how  our  universe  works <period> and  it  tells  us  our  reality  is  continually  branching  into  different  possibilities <comma> just  like  a  coral <period> it  's  a  weird  thing  for  us  humans  to  wrap  our  minds  around <comma> since  we  only  ever  get  to  experience  one  possibility <period> this  quantum  weirdness  was  first  described  by  erwin  schrödinger  and  his  cat <period> the  cat  likes  this  version  better <period> in  this  setup <comma> schrödinger  is  in  a  box  with  a  radioactive  sample <period> that <comma> by  the  laws  of  quantum  mechanics <comma> branches  into  a  state  in  which  it  is  radiated  and  a  state  in  which  it  is  not <period> in  the  branch  in  which  the  sample  radiates <comma> it  sets  off  a  trigger  that  releases  poison  and  schrödinger  is  dead <period> but  in  the  other  branch  of  reality <comma> he  remains  alive <period> these  realities  are  experienced  separately  by  each  individual <period> as  far  as  either  can  tell <comma> the  other  one  does  n't  exist <period> this  seems  weird  to  us <comma> because  each  of  us  only  experiences  an  individual  existence <comma> and  we  do  n't  get  to  see  other  branches <period> it  's  as  if  each  of  us <comma> like  schrödinger  here <comma> are  a  kind  of  coral  branching  into  different  possibilities <period> the  mathematics  of  quantum  mechanics  tells  us  this  is  how  the  world  works  at  tiny  scales <period> it  can  be  summed  up  in  a  single  sentence <comma> everything  that  can  happen <comma> does <period> that  's  quantum  mechanics <period> but  this  does  not  mean  everything  happens <period> the  rest  of  physics  is  about  describing  what  can  happen  and  what  cannot <period> what  physics  tells  us  is  that  everything  comes  down  to  geometry  and  the  interactions  of  elementary  particles <period> and  things  can  happen  only  if  these  interactions  are  perfectly  balanced <period> now  i  'll  go  ahead  and  describe  how  we  know  about  these  particles <comma> what  they  are  and  how  this  balance  works <period> in  this  machine <comma> a  beam  of  protons  and  anti-protons  are  accelerated  to  near  the  speed  of  light  and  brought  together  in  a  collision <comma> producing  a  burst  of  pure  energy <period> this  energy  is  immediately  converted  into  a  spray  of  subatomic  particles <comma> with  detectors  and  computers  used  to  figure  out  their  properties <period> this  enormous  machine <comma> the  large  hadron  collider  at  cern  in  geneva  -- <period> has  a  circumference  of  17  miles  and <comma> when  it  's  operating <comma> draws  five  times  as  much  power  as  the  city  of  monterey <period> we  cannot  predict  specifically  what  particles  will  be  produced <period> in  any  individual  collision <period> quantum  mechanics  tells  us  all  possibilities  are  realized <period> but  physics  does  tell  us  what  particles  can  be  produced <period> these  particles  must  have  just  as  much  mass  and  energy  as  is  carried  in  by  the  proton  and  anti-proton <period> any  particles  more  massive  than  this  energy  limit  are  n't  produced <comma> and  remain  invisible  to  us <period> this  is  why  this  new  particle  accelerator  is  so  exciting <period> it  's  going  to  push  this  energy  limit  seven  times  beyond  what  's  ever  been  done  before <comma> so  we  're  going  to  get  to  see  some  new  particles  very  soon <period> but  before  talking  about  what  we  might  see <comma> let  me  describe  the  particles  we  already  know  of <period> there  's  a  whole  zoo  of  subatomic  particles <period> most  of  us  are  familiar  with  electrons <period> a  lot  of  people  in  this  room  make  a  good  living <period> pushing  them  around <period> but  the  electron  also  has  a  neutral  partner  called  the  neutrino <comma> with  no  electric  charge  and  a  very  tiny  mass <period> in  contrast <comma> the  up-and-down  quarks  have  very  large  masses <comma> and  combine  in  threes  to  make  the  protons  and  neutrons <period> inside  atoms <period> all  of  these  matter  particles  come  in  left-  and  right-handed  varieties <comma> and  have  anti-particle  partners  that  carry  opposite  charges <period> these  familiar  particles  also  have  less  familiar  second  and  third  generations <comma> which  have  the  same  charges  as  the  first  but  have  much  higher  masses <period> these  matter  particles  all  interact  with  the  various  force  particles <period> the  electromagnetic  force  interacts  with  electrically  charged  matter <period> via  particles  called  photons <period> there  is  also  a  very  weak  force  called <comma> rather  unimaginatively <comma> the  weak  force <comma> that  interacts  only  with  left-handed  matter <period> the  strong  force  acts  between  quarks  which  carry  a  different  kind  of  charge <comma> called  color  charge <comma> and  come  in  three  different  varieties <comma> red <comma> green  and  blue <period> you  can  blame  murray  gell-mann  for  these  names  -- <period> they  're  his  fault <period> finally <comma> there  's  the  force  of  gravity <comma> which  interacts  with  matter  via  its  mass  and  spin <period> the  most  important  thing  to  understand  here  is  that  there  's  a  different  kind  of  charge  associated  with  each  of  these  forces <period> these  four  different  forces  interact  with  matter  according  to  the  corresponding  charges  that  each  particle  has <period> a  particle  that  has  n't  been  seen  yet <comma> but  we  're  pretty  sure  exists <comma> is  the  higgs  particle <comma> which  gives  masses  to  all  these  other  particles <period> the  main  purpose  of  the  large  hadron  collider  is  to  see  this  higgs  particle <comma> and  we  're  almost  certain  it  will <period> but  the  greatest  mystery  is  what  else  we  might  see <period> and  i  'm  going  to  show  you  one  beautiful  possibility  towards  the  end  of  this  talk <period> now <comma> if  we  count  up  all  these  different  particles  using  their  various  spins  and  charges <comma> there  are  226 <period> that  's  a  lot  of  particles  to  keep  track  of <period> and  it  seems  strange  that  nature  would  have  so  many  elementary  particles <period> but  if  we  plot  them  out  according  to  their  charges <comma> some  beautiful  patterns  emerge <period> the  most  familiar  charge  is  electric  charge <period> electrons  have  an  electric  charge <comma> a  negative  one <period> and  quarks  have  electric  charges  in  thirds <period> so  when  two  up  quarks  and  a  down  quark  are  combined  to  make  a  proton <comma> it  has  a  total  electric  charge  of  plus  one <period> these  particles  also  have  anti-particles <comma> which  have  opposite  charges <period> now <comma> it  turns  out  the  electric  charge  is  actually  a  combination  of  two  other  charges <comma> hypercharge  and  weak  charge <period> if  we  spread  out  the  hypercharge  and  weak  charge  and  plot  the  charges  of  particles  in  this  two-dimensional  charge  space <comma> the  electric  charge  is  where  these  particles  sit  along  the  vertical  direction <period> the  electromagnetic  and  weak  forces  interact  with  matter  according  to  their  hypercharge  and  weak  charge <period> which  make  this  pattern <period> this  is  called  the  unified  electroweak  model <comma> and  it  was  put  together  back  in  1967 <period> the  reason  most  of  us  are  only  familiar  with  electric  charge  and  not  both  of  these  is  because  of  the  higgs  particle <period> the  higgs <comma> over  here  on  the  left <comma> has  a  large  mass  and  breaks  the  symmetry  of  this  electroweak  pattern <period> it  makes  the  weak  force  very  weak  by  giving  the  weak  particles  a  large  mass <period> since  this  massive  higgs  sits  along  the  horizontal  direction  in  this  diagram <comma> the  photons  of  electromagnetism  remain  massless  and  interact  with  electric  charge  along  the  vertical  direction  in  this  charge  space <period> so  the  electromagnetic  and  weak  forces  are  described  by  this  pattern  of  particle  charges  in  two-dimensional  space <period> we  can  include  the  strong  force  by  spreading  out  its  two  charge  directions  and  plotting  the  charges  of  the  force  particles  in  quarks  along  these  directions <period> the  charges  of  all  known  particles  can  be  plotted  in  a  four-dimensional  charge  space <comma> and  projected  down  to  two  dimensions  like  this  so  we  can  see  them <period> whenever  particles  interact <comma> nature  keeps  things  in  a  perfect  balance  along  all  four  of  these  charge  directions <period> if  a  particle  and  an  anti-particle  collide <comma> it  creates  a  burst  of  energy  and  a  total  charge  of  zero  in  all  four  charge  directions <period> at  this  point <comma> anything  can  be  created  as  long  as  it  has  the  same  energy  and  maintains  a  total  charge  of  zero <period> for  example <comma> this  weak  force  particle  and  its  anti-particle  can  be  created  in  a  collision <period> in  further  interactions <comma> the  charges  must  always  balance <period> one  of  the  weak  particles  could  decay  into  an  electron  and  an  anti-neutrino <comma> and  these  three  still  add  to  zero  total  charge <period> nature  always  keeps  a  perfect  balance <period> so  these  patterns  of  charges  are  not  just  pretty <period> they  tell  us  what  interactions  are  allowed  to  happen <period> and  we  can  rotate  this  charge  space  in  four  dimensions  to  get  a  better  look  at  the  strong  interaction <period> which  has  this  nice  hexagonal  symmetry <period> in  a  strong  interaction <comma> a  strong  force  particle <comma> such  as  this  one <comma> interacts  with  a  colored  quark <comma> such  as  this  green  one <comma> to  give  a  quark  with  a  different  color  charge <comma> this  red  one <period> and  strong  interactions  are  happening  millions  of  times  each  second  in  every  atom  of  our  bodies <comma> holding  the  atomic  nuclei  together <period> but  these  four  charges  corresponding  to  three  forces <period> are  not  the  end  of  the  story <period> we  can  also  include  two  more  charges <period> corresponding  to  the  gravitational  force <period> when  we  include  these <comma> each  matter  particle  has  two  different  spin  charges <comma> spin-up  and  spin-down <period> so  they  all  split <comma> and  give  a  nice  pattern  in  six-dimensional  charge  space <period> we  can  rotate  this  pattern  in  six  dimensions <comma> and  see  that  it  's  quite  pretty <period> right  now <comma> this  pattern  matches  our  best  current  knowledge  of  how  nature  is  built  at  the  tiny  scales  of  these  elementary  particles <period> this  is  what  we  know  for  certain <period> some  of  these  particles  are  at  the  very  limit  of  what  we've  been  able  to  reach  with  experiments <period> from  this  pattern <comma> we  already  know  the  particle  physics  of  these  tiny  scales <period> the  way  the  universe  works  with  these  tiny  scales  is  very  beautiful <period> but  now  i  'm  going  to  discuss  some  new  and  old  ideas  about  things  we  do  n't  know  yet <period> we  want  to  expand  this  pattern  using  mathematics  alone <comma> and  see  if  we  can  get  our  hands  on  the  whole  enchilada <period> we  want  to  find  all  the  particles  and  forces  that  make  a  complete  picture  of  our  universe <period> and  we  want  to  use  this  picture  to  predict  new  particles  that  we  'll  see  when  experiments  reach  higher  energies <period> so  there  's  an  old  idea  in  particle  physics  that  this  known  pattern  of  charges <comma> which  is  not  very  symmetric <comma> could  emerge  from  a  more  perfect  pattern  that  gets  broken <comma> similar  to  how  the  higgs  particle  breaks  the  electroweak  pattern <period> to  give  electromagnetism <period> in  order  to  do  this <comma> we  need  to  introduce  new  forces  with  new  charge  directions <period> when  we  introduce  a  new  direction <comma> we  get  to  guess  what  charges  the  particles  have  along  this  direction <comma> and  then  we  can  rotate  it  in  with  the  others <period> if  we  guess  wisely <comma> we  can  construct  the  standard  charges  in  six  charge  dimensions  as  a  broken  symmetry  of  this  more  perfect  pattern  in  seven  charge  dimensions <period> this  particular  choice  corresponds  to  a  grand  unified  theory  introduced  by  pati  and  salam  in  1973 <period> when  we  look  at  this  new  unified  pattern <comma> we  can  see  a  couple  of  gaps  where  particles  seem  to  be  missing <period> this  is  the  way  theories  of  unification  work <period> a  physicist  looks  for  larger <comma> more  symmetric  patterns  that  include  the  established  pattern  as  a  subset <period> the  larger  pattern  allows  us  to  predict  the  existence  of  particles  that  have  never  been  seen <period> this  unification  model  predicts  the  existence  of  these  two  new  force  particles <comma> which  should  act  a  lot  like  the  weak  force <comma> only  weaker <period> now  we  can  rotate  this  set  of  charges  in  seven  dimensions  and  consider  an  odd  fact  about  the  matter  particles <comma> the  second  and  third  generations  of  matter  have  exactly  the  same  charges  in  six-dimensional  charge  space  as  the  first  generation <period> these  particles  are  not  uniquely  identified  by  their  six  charges <period> they  sit  on  top  of  one  another  in  the  standard  charge  space <period> however <comma> if  we  work  in  eight-dimensional  charge  space <comma> then  we  can  assign  unique  new  charges  to  each  particle <period> then  we  can  spin  these  in  eight  dimensions <comma> and  see  what  the  whole  pattern  looks  like <period> here  we  can  see  the  second  and  third  generations  of  matter  now  related  to  the  first  generation  by  a  symmetry  called  triality <period> this  particular  pattern  of  charges  in  eight  dimensions  is  actually  part  of  the  most  beautiful  geometric  structure  in  mathematics <period> it  's  a  pattern  of  the  largest  exceptional  lie  group <comma> e8 <period> this  lie  group  is  a  smooth <comma> curved  shape  with  248  dimensions <period> each  point  in  this  pattern  corresponds  to  a  symmetry  of  this  very  complex  and  beautiful  shape <period> one  small  part  of  this  e8  shape  can  be  used  to  describe  the  curved  space-time  of  einstein  's  general  relativity <period> explaining  gravity <period> together  with  quantum  mechanics <comma> the  geometry  of  this  shape  could  describe  everything  about  how  the  universe  works  at  the  tiniest  scales <period> the  pattern  of  this  shape  living  in  eight-dimensional  charge  space  is  exquisitely  beautiful <comma> and  it  summarizes  thousands  of  possible  interactions  between  these  elementary  particles <comma> each  of  which  is  just  a  facet  of  this  complicated  shape <period> as  we  spin  it <comma> we  can  see  many  of  the  other  intricate  patterns <period> contained  in  this  one <period> and  with  a  particular  rotation <comma> we  can  look  down  through  this  pattern  in  eight  dimensions  along  a  symmetry  axis  and  see  all  the  particles  at  once <period> it  's  a  very  beautiful  object <comma> and  as  with  any  unification <comma> we  can  see  some  holes  where  new  particles  are  required <period> by  this  pattern <period> there  are  20  gaps  where  new  particles  should  be <comma> two  of  which  have  been  filled  by  the  pati-salam  particles <period> from  their  location  in  this  pattern <comma> we  know  that  these  new  particles  should  be  scalar  fields  like  the  higgs  particle <comma> but  have  color  charge  and  interact  with  the  strong  force <period> filling  in  these  new  particles  completes  this  pattern <comma> giving  us  the  full  e8 <period> this  e8  pattern  has  very  deep  mathematical  roots <period> it  's  considered  by  many  to  be  the  most  beautiful  structure <period> in  mathematics <period> it  's  a  fantastic  prospect  that  this  object  of  great  mathematical  beauty  could  describe  the  truth  of  particle  interactions  at  the  smallest  scales  imaginable <period> and  this  idea  that  nature  is  described  by  mathematics  is  not  at  all  new <period> in  1623 <comma> galileo  wrote  this <comma> nature  's  grand  book <comma> which  stands  continually  open  to  our  gaze <comma> is  written  in  the  language  of  mathematics <period> its  characters  are  triangles <comma> circles  and  other  geometrical  figures <comma> without  which  it  is  humanly  impossible  to  understand  a  single  word  of  it <period> without  these <comma> one  is  wandering  around  in  a  dark  labyrinth <period> i  believe  this  to  be  true <comma> and  i've  tried  to  follow  galileo  's  guidance  in  describing  the  mathematics  of  particle  physics  using  only  triangles <comma> circles  and  other  geometrical  figures <period> of  course <comma> when  other  physicists  and  i  actually  work  on  this  stuff <comma> the  mathematics  can  resemble  a  dark  labyrinth <period> but  it  's  reassuring  that  at  the  heart  of  this  mathematics  is  pure <comma> beautiful  geometry <period> joined  with  quantum  mechanics <comma> this  mathematics  describes  our  universe  as  a  growing  e8  coral <comma> with  particles  interacting  at  every  location  in  all  possible  ways  according  to  a  beautiful  pattern <period> and  as  more  of  the  pattern  comes  into  view  using  new  machines  like  the  large  hadron  collider <comma> we  may  be  able  to  see  whether  nature  uses  this  e8  pattern  or  a  different  one <period> this  process  of  discovery  is  a  wonderful  adventure  to  be  involved  in <period> if  the  lhc  finds  particles  that  fit  this  e8  pattern <comma> that  will  be  very <comma> very  cool <period> if  the  lhc  finds  new  particles <comma> but  they  do  n't  fit  this  pattern <comma> well <comma> that  will  be  very  interesting <comma> but  bad  for  this  e8  theory <period> and <comma> of  course <comma> bad  for  me  personally <period> now  how  bad  would  that  be <questionmark> well <comma> pretty  bad <period> but  predicting  how  nature  works  is  a  very  risky  game <period> this  theory  and  others  like  it  are  long  shots <period> one  does  a  lot  of  hard  work  knowing  that  most  of  these  ideas  probably  wo  n't  end  up  being  true  about  nature <period> that  's  what  doing  theoretical  physics  is  like: <period> there  are  a  lot  of  wipeouts <period> in  this  regard <comma> new  physics  theories  are  a  lot  like  start-up  companies <period> as  with  any  large  investment <comma> it  can  be  emotionally  difficult  to  abandon  a  line  of  research  when  it  is  n't  working  out <period> but  in  science <comma> if  something  is  n't  working <comma> you  have  to  toss  it  out  and  try  something  else <period> now <comma> the  only  way  to  maintain  sanity  and  achieve  happiness  in  the  midst  of  this  uncertainty  is  to  keep  balance  and  perspective  in  life <period> i've  tried  the  best  i  can  to  live  a  balanced  life <period> i  try  to  balance  my  life  equally  between  physics <comma> love  and  surfing <comma> my  own  three  charge  directions <period> this  way <comma> even  if  the  physics  i  work  on  comes  to  nothing <comma> i  still  know  i've  lived  a  good  life <period> and  i  try  to  live  in  beautiful  places <period> for  most  of  the  past  ten  years  i've  lived  on  the  island  of  maui <comma> a  very  beautiful  place <period> now  it  's  one  of  the  greatest  mysteries  in  the  universe  to  my  parents  how  i  managed  to  survive  all  that  time  without  engaging  in  anything  resembling  full-time  employment <period> i  'm  going  to  let  you  in  on  that  secret <period> this  was  a  view  from  my  home  office  on  maui <period> and  this  is  another <comma> and  another <period> and  you  may  have  noticed  that  these  beautiful  views  are  similar <comma> but  in  slightly  different  places <period> that  's  because  this  used  to  be  my  home  and  office  on  maui <period> i've  chosen  a  very  unusual  life <period> but  not  worrying  about  rent  allowed  me  to  spend  my  time <period> doing  what  i  love <period> living  a  nomadic  existence  has  been  hard  at  times <comma> but  it  's  allowed  me  to  live  in  beautiful  places  and  keep  a  balance  in  my  life  that  i've  been  happy  with <period> it  allows  me  to  spend  a  lot  of  my  time  hanging  out  with  hyper-intelligent  coral <period> but  i  also  greatly  enjoy  the  company  of  hyper-intelligent  people <period> so  i  'm  very  happy  to  have  been  invited  here  to  ted <period> thank  you  very  much <period> chris  anderson <comma> i  probably  understood  two  percent  of  that <comma> but  i  still  absolutely  loved  it <period> so  i  'm  going  to  sound  dumb <period> your  theory  of  everything <comma> garrett  lisi <comma> i  'm  used  to  coral <period> ca <comma> that  's  right <period> the  reason  it  's  got  a  few  people  at  least  excited  is  because <comma> if  you  're  right <comma> it  brings  gravity  and  quantum  theory  together <period> so  are  you  saying  that  we  should  think  of  the  universe <comma> at  its  heart <comma> that  the  smallest  things  that  there  are <comma> are  somehow  an  e8  object  of  possibility <questionmark> i  mean <comma> is  there  a  scale  to  it <comma> at  the  smallest  scale <comma> or   <questionmark> gl <comma> well <comma> right  now  the  pattern  i  showed  you  that  corresponds  to  what  we  know  about  elementary  particle  physics <comma> that  already  corresponds  to  a  very  beautiful  shape <period> and  that  's  the  one  that  i  said  we  knew  for  certain <period> and  that  shape  has  remarkable  similarities <comma> and  the  way  it  fits  into  this  e8  pattern  could  be  the  rest  of  the  picture <period> and  these  patterns  of  points  that  i've  shown  for  you  actually  represent  symmetries  of  this  high-dimensional  object  that  would  be  warping  and  moving  and  dancing  over  the  space  time  that  we  experience <period> and  that  would  be  what  explains  all  these  elementary  particles  that  we  see <period> ca <comma> but  a  string  theorist <comma> as  i  understand  it <comma> explains  electrons  in  terms  of  much  smaller  strings  vibrating <comma> i  know  you  do  n't  like  string  theory <comma> vibrating  inside  it <period> how  should  we  think  of  an  electron  in  relation  to  e8 <questionmark> gl <comma> no <comma> it  would  be  one  of  the  symmetries  of  this  e8  shape <period> so  what  's  happening  is <comma> as  the  shape  is  moving  over  space-time <comma> it  's  twisting <period> and  the  direction  it  's  twisting  as  it  moves  is  what  particle  we  see <period> so  it  would  be <comma> ca <comma> the  size  of  the  e8  shape <comma> how  does  that  relate  to  the  electron <questionmark> i  kind  of  feel  like  i  need  that  for  my  picture <period> is  it  bigger <questionmark> is  it  smaller <questionmark> gl <comma> well <comma> as  far  as  we  know  electrons  are  point  particles <comma> so  this  would  be  going  down  to  the  smallest  possible  scales <period> so  the  way  these  things  are  explained  in  quantum  field  theory  is <comma> all  possibilities  are  expanding  and  developing  at  once <period> and  this  is  why  i  use  the  analogy  to  coral <period> and  in  this  way <comma> the  way  that  e8  comes  in  is  it  will  be  as  a  shape  that  's  attached  at  each  point  in  space-time <period> and <comma> as  i  said <comma> the  way  the  shape  twists <comma> the  directional  along  which  way  the  shape  is  twisting  as  it  moves  over  this  curved  surface <comma> is  what  the  elementary  particles  are <comma> themselves <period> so  through  quantum  field  theory <comma> they  manifest  themselves  as  points  and  interact  that  way <period> i  do  n't  know  if  i  'll  be  able  to  make  this  any  clearer <period> ca <comma> it  does  n't  really  matter <period> it  's  evoking  a  kind  of  sense  of  wonder <comma> and  i  certainly  want  to  understand  more  of  this <period> but  thank  you  so  much  for  coming <period> that  was  absolutely  fascinating <period> those  of  you  who  know  me  know  how  passionate  i  am  about  opening  the  space  frontier <period> so  when  i  had  the  chance  to  give  the  world  's  expert  in  gravity  the  experience  of  zero  gravity <comma> it  was  incredible <period> and  i  want  to  tell  you  that  story <period> i  first  met  him  through  the  archon  x  prize  for  genomics <period> it  's  a  competition  we  're  holding <comma> the  second  x  prize <comma> for  the  first  team  to  sequence  100  human  genomes  in  10  days <period> we  have  something  called  the  genome  100 <comma> 100  individuals  we  're  sequencing  as  part  of  that <period> craig  venter  chairs  that  event <period> and  i  met  professor  hawking <comma> and  he  said  his  dream  was  to  travel  into  space <period> and  i  said <comma> i  cannot  take  you  there <comma> but  i  can  take  you  into  weightlessness  into  zero-g <period> and  he  said <comma> on  the  spot <comma> absolutely <comma> yes <period> well <comma> the  only  way  to  experience  zero-g  on  earth  is  actually  with  parabolic  flight <comma> weightless  flight <period> you  take  an  airplane <comma> you  fly  over  the  top <comma> you  're  weightless  for  25  seconds <period> come  back  down <comma> you  weigh  twice  as  much <period> you  can  get  eight <comma> 10  minutes  of  weightlessness <comma> how  nasa  's  trained  their  astronauts  for  so  long <period> we  set  out  to  do  this <period> it  took  us  11  years  to  become  operational <period> and  we  announced  that  we  were  going  to  fly  stephen  hawking <period> we  had  one  government  agency  and  one  company  aircraft  operator  say <comma> you  're  crazy <comma> do  n't  do  that <comma> you  're  going  kill  the  guy <period> and  he  wanted  to  go <period> we  worked  hard  to  get  all  the  permissions <period> and  six  months  later <comma> we  sat  down  at  kennedy  space  center <period> we  had  a  press  conference <comma> we  announced  our  intent  to  do  one  zero-g  parabola <comma> give  him  25  seconds  of  zero-g <period> and  if  it  went  really  well <comma> we  might  do  three  parabolas <period> well <comma> we  asked  him  why  he  wanted  to  go  up  and  do  this <period> and  what  he  said <comma> for  me <comma> was  very  moving <period> he  said <comma> life  on  earth  is  at  an  ever-increasing  risk  of  being  wiped  out  by  disaster <period> i  think  the  human  race  does  n't  have  a  future  if  it  does  n't  go  into  space <period> i  therefore  want  to  encourage  public  interest  in  space <period> we  took  him  out  to  the  kennedy  space  center <comma> up  inside  the  nasa  vehicle <comma> into  the  back  of  the  zero-g  airplane <period> we  had  about  20  people  who  made  donations <comma> we  raised  $150,000  in  donations  for  children  's  charities <comma> who  flew  with  us <period> a  few  tedsters  here <period> we  set  up  a  whole  er <period> we  had  four  emergency  room  doctors  and  two  nurses  on  board  the  airplane <period> we  were  monitoring  his  po2  of  his  blood <comma> his  heart  rate <comma> his  blood  pressure <period> we  had  everything  all  set  in  case  of  an  emergency <period> god  knows <comma> you  do  n't  want  to  hurt  this  world-renowned  expert <period> we  took  off  from  the  shuttle  landing  facility <comma> where  the  shuttle  takes  off  and  lands <period> and  my  partner  byron  lichtenberg  and  i  carefully  suspended  him  into  zero-g <period> once  he  was  there <comma> we  let  him  go  to  experience  what  weightlessness  was  truly  like <period> and  after  that  first  parabola <comma> you  know <comma> the  doc  said  everything  is  great <period> he  was  smiling <comma> and  we  said  go <period> so  we  did  a  second  parabola <period> and  a  third <period> we  actually  floated  an  apple  in  homage  to  sir  isaac  newton  because  professor  hawking  holds  the  same  chair  at  cambridge  that  isaac  newton  did <period> and  we  did  a  fourth <comma> and  a  fifth  and  a  sixth <period> and  a  seventh  and  an  eighth <period> and  this  man  does  not  look  like  a  65-year-old  wheelchair-bound  man <period> he  was  so  happy <period> we  are  living  on  a  precious  jewel <comma> and  it  's  during  our  lifetime  that  we  're  moving  off  this  planet <period> please  join  us  in  this  epic  adventure <period> thank  you  so  much <period> today  i'd  like  to  show  you  the  future  of  the  way  we  make  things <period> i  believe  that  soon  our  buildings  and  machines  will  be  self-assembling <comma> replicating  and  repairing  themselves <period> so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  what  i  believe  is  the  current  state  of  manufacturing <comma> and  then  compare  that  to  some  natural  systems <period> so  in  the  current  state  of  manufacturing <comma> we  have  skyscrapers <comma> two  and  a  half  years  of  assembly  time <comma> 500,000  to  a  million  parts <comma> fairly  complex <comma> new <comma> exciting  technologies  in  steel <comma> concrete <comma> glass <period> we  have  exciting  machines  that  can  take  us  into  space <comma> five  years  of  assembly  time <comma> 25  million  parts <period> but  on  the  other  side <comma> if  you  look  at  the  natural  systems <comma> we  have  proteins  that  have  two  million  types <comma> can  fold  in  10,000  nanoseconds <comma> or  dna  with  three  billion  base  pairs  we  can  replicate  in  roughly  an  hour <period> so  there  's  all  of  this  complexity  in  our  natural  systems <comma> but  they  're  extremely  efficient <comma> far  more  efficient  than  anything  we  can  build <comma> far  more  complex  than  anything  we  can  build <period> they  're  far  more  efficient  in  terms  of  energy <period> they  hardly  ever  make  mistakes <period> and  they  can  repair  themselves  for  longevity <period> so  there  's  something  super  interesting  about  natural  systems <period> and  if  we  can  translate  that  into  our  built  environment <comma> then  there  's  some  exciting  potential  for  the  way  that  we  build  things <period> and  i  think  the  key  to  that  is  self-assembly <period> so  if  we  want  to  utilize  self-assembly  in  our  physical  environment <comma> i  think  there  's  four  key  factors <period> the  first  is  that  we  need  to  decode  all  of  the  complexity  of  what  we  want  to  build <comma> so  our  buildings  and  machines <period> and  we  need  to  decode  that  into  simple  sequences <comma> basically  the  dna  of  how  our  buildings  work <period> then  we  need  programmable  parts  that  can  take  that  sequence  and  use  that  to  fold  up <comma> or  reconfigure <period> we  need  some  energy  that  's  going  to  allow  that  to  activate <comma> allow  our  parts  to  be  able  to  fold  up  from  the  program <period> and  we  need  some  type  of  error  correction  redundancy  to  guarantee  that  we  have  successfully  built  what  we  want <period> so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  number  of  projects  that  my  colleagues  and  i  at  mit  are  working  on  to  achieve  this  self-assembling  future <period> the  first  two  are  the  macrobot  and  decibot <period> so  these  projects  are  large-scale  reconfigurable  robots <comma> 8  ft <comma> 12  ft <period> long  proteins <period> they  're  embedded  with  mechanical  electrical  devices <comma> sensors <period> you  decode  what  you  want  to  fold  up  into <comma> into  a  sequence  of  angles <comma> so  negative  120 <comma> negative  120 <comma> 0 <comma> 0 <comma> 120 <comma> negative  120 <comma> something  like  that <period> so  a  sequence  of  angles <comma> or  turns <comma> and  you  send  that  sequence  through  the  string <period> each  unit  takes  its  message <comma> so  negative  120  -- <period> it  rotates  to  that <comma> checks  if  it  got  there  and  then  passes  it  to  its  neighbor <period> so  these  are  the  brilliant  scientists <comma> engineers <comma> designers  that  worked  on  this  project <period> and  i  think  it  really  brings  to  light <comma> is  this  really  scalable <questionmark> i  mean <comma> thousands  of  dollars <comma> lots  of  man  hours  made  to  make  this  eight-foot  robot <period> can  we  really  scale  this  up <questionmark> can  we  really  embed  robotics  into  every  part <questionmark> the  next  one  questions  that  and  looks  at  passive  nature <comma> or  passively  trying  to  have  reconfiguration  programmability <period> but  it  goes  a  step  further <comma> and  it  tries  to  have  actual  computation <period> it  basically  embeds  the  most  fundamental  building  block  of  computing <comma> the  digital  logic  gate <comma> directly  into  your  parts <period> so  this  is  a  nand  gate <period> you  have  one  tetrahedron  which  is  the  gate  that  's  going  to  do  your  computing <comma> and  you  have  two  input  tetrahedrons <period> one  of  them  is  the  input  from  the  user <comma> as  you  're  building  your  bricks <period> the  other  one  is  from  the  previous  brick  that  was  placed <period> and  then  it  gives  you  an  output  in  3d  space <period> so  what  this  means  is  that  the  user  can  start  plugging  in  what  they  want  the  bricks  to  do <period> it  computes  on  what  it  was  doing  before  and  what  you  said  you  wanted  it  to  do <period> and  now  it  starts  moving  in  three-dimensional  space <comma> so  up  or  down <period> so  on  the  left-hand  side <comma> 1,1  input  equals  0  output <comma> which  goes  down <period> on  the  right-hand  side <comma> 0,0  input  is  a  1  output <comma> which  goes  up <period> and  so  what  that  really  means  is  that  our  structures  now  contain  the  blueprints  of  what  we  want  to  build <period> so  they  have  all  of  the  information  embedded  in  them  of  what  was  constructed <period> so  that  means  that  we  can  have  some  form  of  self-replication <period> in  this  case  i  call  it  self-guided  replication <comma> because  your  structure  contains  the  exact  blueprints <period> if  you  have  errors <comma> you  can  replace  a  part <period> all  the  local  information  is  embedded  to  tell  you  how  to  fix  it <period> so  you  could  have  something  that  climbs  along  and  reads  it  and  can  output  at  one  to  one <period> it  's  directly  embedded <period> there  's  no  external  instructions <period> so  the  last  project  i  'll  show  is  called  biased  chains <comma> and  it  's  probably  the  most  exciting  example  that  we  have  right  now  of  passive  self-assembly  systems <period> so  it  takes  the  reconfigurability  and  programmability  and  makes  it  a  completely  passive  system <period> so  basically  you  have  a  chain  of  elements <period> each  element  is  completely  identical <comma> and  they  're  biased <period> so  each  chain <comma> or  each  element <comma> wants  to  turn  right  or  left <period> so  as  you  assemble  the  chain <comma> you  're  basically  programming  it <period> you  're  telling  each  unit  if  it  should  turn  right  or  left <period> so  when  you  shake  the  chain <comma> it  then  folds  up  into  any  configuration  that  you've  programmed  in <comma> so  in  this  case <comma> a  spiral <comma> or  in  this  case <comma> two  cubes  next  to  each  other <period> so  you  can  basically  program  any  three-dimensional  shape <comma> or  one-dimensional <comma> two-dimensional <comma> up  into  this  chain  completely  passively <period> so  what  does  this  tell  us  about  the  future <questionmark> i  think  that  it  's  telling  us  that  there  's  new  possibilities  for  self-assembly <comma> replication <comma> repair  in  our  physical  structures <comma> our  buildings <comma> machines <period> there  's  new  programmability  in  these  parts <period> and  from  that  you  have  new  possibilities  for  computing <period> we  'll  have  spatial  computing <period> imagine  if  our  buildings <comma> our  bridges <comma> machines <comma> all  of  our  bricks  could  actually  compute <period> that  's  amazing  parallel  and  distributed  computing  power <comma> new  design  possibilities <period> so  it  's  exciting  potential  for  this <period> so  i  think  these  projects  i've  showed  here  are  just  a  tiny  step  towards  this  future <comma> if  we  implement  these  new  technologies  for  a  new  self-assembling  world <period> thank  you <period> i  'm  a  filmmaker <period> for  the  last  8  years <comma> i  have  dedicated  my  life  to  documenting  the  work  of  israelis  and  palestinians  who  are  trying  to  end  the  conflict  using  peaceful  means <period> when  i  travel  with  my  work  across  europe  and  the  united  states <comma> one  question  always  comes  up <comma> where  is  the  palestinian  gandhi <questionmark> why  are  n't  palestinians  using  nonviolent  resistance <questionmark> the  challenge  i  face  when  i  hear  this  question  is  that  often  i  have  just  returned  from  the  middle  east  where  i  spent  my  time  filming  dozens  of  palestinians  who  are  using  nonviolence  to  defend  their  lands  and  water  resources  from  israeli  soldiers  and  settlers <period> these  leaders  are  trying  to  forge  a  massive  national  nonviolent  movement  to  end  the  occupation  and  build  peace  in  the  region <period> yet <comma> most  of  you  have  probably  never  heard  about  them <period> this  divide  between  what  's  happening  on  the  ground  and  perceptions  abroad  is  one  of  the  key  reasons  why  we  do  n't  have  yet  a  palestinian  peaceful  resistance  movement  that  has  been  successful <period> so  i  'm  here  today  to  talk  about  the  power  of  attention <comma> the  power  of  your  attention <comma> and  the  emergence  and  development  of  nonviolent  movements  in  the  west  bank <comma> gaza  and  elsewhere <comma> but  today <comma> my  case  study  is  going  to  be  palestine <period> i  believe  that  what  's  mostly  missing  for  nonviolence  to  grow  is  not  for  palestinians  to  start  adopting  nonviolence <comma> but  for  us  to  start  paying  attention  to  those  who  already  are <period> allow  me  to  illustrate  this  point  by  taking  you  to  this  village  called  budrus <period> about  seven  years  ago <comma> they  faced  extinction <comma> because  israel  announced  it  would  build  a  separation  barrier <comma> and  part  of  this  barrier  would  be  built  on  top  of  the  village <period> they  would  lose  40  percent  of  their  land  and  be  surrounded <comma> so  they  would  lose  free  access  to  the  rest  of  the  west  bank <period> through  inspired  local  leadership <comma> they  launched  a  peaceful  resistance  campaign  to  stop  that  from  happening <period> let  me  show  you  some  brief  clips <comma> so  you  have  a  sense  for  what  that  actually  looked  like  on  the  ground <period> palestinian  woman <comma> we  were  told  the  wall  would  separate  palestine  from  israel <period> here  in  budrus <comma> we  realized  the  wall  would  steal  our  land <period> israeli  man <comma> the  fence  has <comma> in  fact <comma> created  a  solution  to  terror <period> man <comma> today  you  're  invited  to  a  peaceful  march <period> you  are  joined  by  dozens  of  your  israeli  brothers  and  sisters <period> israeli  activist <comma> nothing  scares  the  army  more  than  nonviolent  opposition <period> woman <comma> we  saw  the  men  trying  to  push  the  soldiers <comma> but  none  of  them  could  do  that <period> but  i  think  the  girls  could  do  it <period> fatah  party  member <comma> we  must  empty  our  minds  of  traditional  thinking <period> hamas  party  member <comma> we  were  in  complete  harmony <comma> and  we  wanted  to  spread  it  to  all  of  palestine <period> chanting <comma> one  united  nation <period> fatah <comma> hamas  and  the  popular  front <period> news  anchor <comma> the  clashes  over  the  fence  continue <period> reporter <comma> israeli  border  police  were  sent  to  disperse  the  crowd <period> they  were  allowed  to  use  any  force  necessary <period> man <comma> these  are  live  bullets <period> it  's  like  fallujah <period> shooting  everywhere <period> israeli  activist <comma> i  was  sure  we  were  all  going  to  die <period> but  there  were  others  around  me  who  were  n't  even  cowering <period> israeli  soldier <comma> a  nonviolent  protest  is  not  going  to  stop  the  unclear <period> protester <comma> this  is  a  peaceful  march <period> there  is  no  need  to  use  violence <period> chanting <comma> we  can  do  it <period> we  can  do  it <period> we  can  do  it <period> julia  bacha <comma> when  i  first  heard  about  the  story  of  budrus <comma> i  was  surprised  that  the  international  media  had  failed  to  cover  the  extraordinary  set  of  events  that  happened  seven  years  ago <comma> in  2003 <period> what  was  even  more  surprising  was  the  fact  that  budrus  was  successful <period> the  residents <comma> after  10  months  of  peaceful  resistance <comma> convinced  the  israeli  government  to  move  the  route  of  the  barrier  off  their  lands  and  to  the  green  line <comma> which  is  the  internationally  recognized  boundary  between  israel  and  the  palestinian  territories <period> the  resistance  in  budrus  has  since  spread  to  villages  across  the  west  bank  and  to  palestinian  neighborhoods  in  jerusalem <period> yet  the  media  remains  mostly  silent  on  these  stories <period> this  silence  carries  profound  consequences  for  the  likelihood  that  nonviolence  can  grow <comma> or  even  survive <comma> in  palestine <period> violent  resistance  and  nonviolent  resistance  share  one  very  important  thing  in  common <period> they  are  both  a  form  of  theater  seeking  an  audience  to  their  cause <period> if  violent  actors  are  the  only  ones  constantly  getting  front-page  covers  and  attracting  international  attention  to  the  palestinian  issue <comma> it  becomes  very  hard  for  nonviolent  leaders  to  make  the  case  to  their  communities  that  civil  disobedience  is  a  viable  option  in  addressing  their  plight <period> the  power  of  attention  is  probably  going  to  come  as  no  surprise  to  the  parents  in  the  room <period> the  surest  way  to  make  your  child  throw  increasingly  louder  tantrums  is  by  giving  him  attention  the  first  time  he  throws  a  fit <period> the  tantrum  will  become  what  childhood  psychologists  call  a  functional  behavior <comma> since  the  child  has  learned  that  he  can  get  parental  attention  out  of  it <period> parents  can  incentivize  or  disincentivize  behavior  simply  by  giving  or  withdrawing  attention  to  their  children <period> but  that  's  true  for  adults  too <period> in  fact <comma> the  behavior  of  entire  communities  and  countries  can  be  influenced <comma> depending  on  where  the  international  community  chooses  to  focus  its  attention <period> i  believe  that  at  the  core  of  ending  the  conflict  in  the  middle  east  and  bringing  peace  is  for  us  to  transform  nonviolence  into  a  functional  behavior  by  giving  a  lot  more  attention  to  the  nonviolent  leaders  on  the  ground  today <period> in  the  course  of  taking  my  film  to  villages  in  the  west  bank <comma> in  gaza  and  in  east  jerusalem <comma> i  have  seen  the  impact  that  even  one  documentary  film  can  have  in  influencing  the  transformation <period> in  a  village  called  wallajeh <comma> which  sits  very  close  to  jerusalem <comma> the  community  was  facing  a  very  similar  plight  to  budrus <period> they  were  going  to  be  surrounded <comma> lose  a  lot  of  their  lands  and  not  have  freedom  of  access <comma> either  to  the  west  bank  or  jerusalem <period> they  had  been  using  nonviolence  for  about  two  years  but  had  grown  disenchanted  since  nobody  was  paying  attention <period> so  we  organized  a  screening <period> a  week  later <comma> they  held  the  most  well-attended  and  disciplined  demonstration  to  date <period> the  organizers  say  that  the  villagers <comma> upon  seeing  the  story  of  budrus  documented  in  a  film <comma> felt  that  there  were  indeed  people  following  what  they  were  doing <comma> that  people  cared <period> so  they  kept  on  going <period> on  the  israeli  side <comma> there  is  a  new  peace  movement  called  solidariot <comma> which  means  solidarity  in  hebrew <period> the  leaders  of  this  movement  have  been  using  budrus  as  one  of  their  primary  recruiting  tools <period> they  report  that  israelis  who  had  never  been  active  before <comma> upon  seeing  the  film <comma> understand  the  power  of  nonviolence  and  start  joining  their  activities <period> the  examples  of  wallajeh  and  the  solidariot  movement  show  that  even  a  small-budget  independent  film  can  play  a  role  in  transforming  nonviolence  into  a  functional  behavior <period> now  imagine  the  power  that  big  media  players  could  have  if  they  started  covering  the  weekly  nonviolent  demonstrations  happening  in  villages  like  bil'in <comma> ni'lin <comma> wallajeh <comma> in  jerusalem  neighborhoods  like  sheikh  jarrah  and  silwan <comma> the  nonviolent  leaders  would  become  more  visible <comma> valued  and  effective  in  their  work <period> i  believe  that  the  most  important  thing  is  to  understand  that  if  we  do  n't  pay  attention  to  these  efforts <comma> they  are  invisible <comma> and  it  's  as  if  they  never  happened <period> but  i  have  seen  first  hand  that  if  we  do <comma> they  will  multiply <period> if  they  multiply <comma> their  influence  will  grow  in  the  overall  israeli-palestinian  conflict <period> and  theirs  is  the  kind  of  influence  that  can  finally  unblock  the  situation <period> these  leaders  have  proven  that  nonviolence  works  in  places  like  budrus <period> let  's  give  them  attention  so  they  can  prove  it  works  everywhere <period> thank  you <period>
