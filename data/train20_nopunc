adrian kohler well we 're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse basil jones but actually we 're going to start this evolution with a hyena ak the ancestor of the horse okay we 'll do something with it hahahaha the hyena is the ancestor of 
 the horse because it was part of a production called faustus in africa a handspring production from 1995 where it had to play draughts with helen of troy this production was directed by south african artist and theater director william kentridge so it needed a very articulate front paw 
 but like all puppets it has other attributes bj one of them is breath and it kind of breathes ak haa haa haaa bj breath is really important for us it 's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage it 's the thing that distinguishes 
 the puppet ak oops bj from an actor puppets always have to try to be alive it 's their kind of ur-story onstage that desperation to live ak yeah it 's basically a dead object as you can see and it only lives because you make it an 
 actor struggles to die onstage but a puppet has to struggle to live and in a way that 's a metaphor for life bj so every moment it 's on the stage it 's making the struggle so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th 
 century technology to turn nouns into verbs ak well actually i prefer to say that it 's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life bj okay so ak it has ears that move passively 
 when the head goes bj and it has these bulkheads made out of plywood covered with fabric curiously similar in fact to the plywood canoes that adrian 's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop ak in port elizabeth the village outside port elizabeth 
 in south africa bj his mother was a puppeteer and when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 i hated puppets i really thought they were so beneath me i wanted to become an avant-garde artist and punch and judy was certainly not where i 
 wanted to go and in fact it took about 10 years to discover the bambara bamana puppets of mali in west africa where there 's a fabulous tradition of puppetry to learn a renewed or a new respect for this art form ak so in 1981 i persuaded basil 
 and some friends of mine to form a puppet company and 20 years later miraculously we collaborated with a company from mali the sogolon marionette troupe of bamako where we made a piece about a tall giraffe it was just called tall horse which was a life-sized giraffe 
 bj and here again you see the same structure the bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane but it 's ultimately the same structure it 's got two people inside it on stilts which give them the height and somebody in the front who 's using a kind of 
 steering wheel to move that head ak the person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail a bit like the hyena same mechanism just a bit bigger and he 's controlling the ear movement bj so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre 
 in london and just around that time his mother had said have you seen this book by michael morpurgo called war horse' ak it 's about a boy who falls in love with a horse the horse is sold to the first world war and he joins up to 
 find his horse bj so tom gave us a call and said do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the national theatre ak it seemed a lovely idea bj but it had to ride it had to have a rider 
 ak it had to have a rider and it had to participate in cavalry charges a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london but they agreed to go along with 
 it for a while so we began with a test bj this is adrian and thys stander who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse and our next-door neighbor katherine riding on a ladder the weight is really difficult when it 's up above your 
 head ak and once we put katherine through that particular brand of hell we knew that we might be able to make a horse which could be ridden so we made a model this is a cardboard model a little bit smaller than the hyena you 'll notice that 
 the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there bj and the two manipulators are inside but we did n't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator because we could n't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the 
 same time ak we started work on the prototype after the model was approved and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones and we had a crate built for it it had to be 
 shipped to london we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town and it got to midnight and we had n't done that yet bj so we got a camera and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances and we sent 
 it off to the national theatre hoping that they believed that we created something that worked ak a month later we were there in london with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us bj about 40 people ak we were terrified 
 we opened the lid we took the horse out and it did work it walked and it was able to be ridden here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype this is in the national theatre studio the place where they cook new ideas 
 it had by no means got the green light yet the choreographer toby sedgwick invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs grew up into the big horse and nick starr the director of the national theatre saw 
 that particular moment he was standing next to me he nearly wet himself and so the show was given the green light and we went back to cape town and redesigned the horse completely here is the plan and here is our factory in cape town where we make horses 
 you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there the horses are completely handmade there is very little 20th century technology in them we used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces but because they have to be light 
 and flexible and each one of them is different they cannot be mass-produced unfortunately so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london and now we would like to introduce you to joey joey boy you there joey joey joey come here no no i 
 have n't got it he 's got it it 's in his pocket bj joey ak joey joey joey joey come here stand here where people can see you move around come on i'd just like to describe i wo n't talk too loud he might get irritated here 
 craig is working the head he has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand each one of them operates either an ear separately or the head up and down but he also controls the head directly by using his hand the ears are obviously a 
 very important emotional indicator of the horse when they point right back the horse is fearful or angry depending upon what 's going on in front of him around him or when he 's more relaxed the head comes down and the ears listen either side horses hearing is 
 very important it 's almost more important than their eyesight over here tommy 's got what you call the heart position he 's working the leg you see the string tendon from the hyena the hyena 's front leg automatically pulls the hoop up horses are so unpredictable 
 the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it 's a convincing horse action the hind legs have got the same action bj and mikey also has in his fingers the ability to move the tail from left to right and up and 
 down with the other hand and together there 's quite a complex possibility of tail expression ak you want to say something about the breathing bj we had a big challenge with breathing adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in 
 two and make it breathe like that because that 's how a horse would breathe with an expanded chest but we realized that if that were to be happening you would n't as an audience see the breath so he made a channel in here and the chest moves 
 up and down in that channel so it 's anti-naturalistic really the up and down movement but it feels like breath and it 's very very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees ak other emotional stuff if i were to touch the 
 horse here on his skin the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver you 'll notice of course that the puppet is made out of cane lines and i would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice that 
 i was making a three-dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space but of course it was the cane is light the cane is flexible the cane is durable and the cane is moldable and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane 
 the skin itself is made out of a see-through nylon mesh which if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike you see the skeletal structure of it or if you light it from above it becomes more 
 solid again that was a practical consideration the guys inside the horse have to be able to see out they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production and it 's very much an in-the-moment activity that they 're engaged in it 
 's three heads making one character but now we would like you to put joey through some paces and plant thank you and now just all the way from sunny california we have zem joaquin who 's going to ride the horse for us so we would like to stress 
 that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly bj not being able to talk to one another while they 're onstage because they 're mic'd the sound that that very large chest makes of the horse the whinnying and 
 the nickering and everything that starts usually with one performer carries on with a second person and ends with a third ak mikey brett from leicestershire mikey brett craig leo zem joaquin and basil and me thank you thank you one of the most common ways of dividing the 
 world is into those who believe and those who do n't into the religious and the atheists and for the last decade or so it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means there have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out not just that religion is 
 wrong but that it 's ridiculous these people many of whom have lived in north oxford have argued they've argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game now i think it 's too easy i 
 think it 's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way and it 's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel and what i'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist if you like a new version of atheism we could call 
 atheism 20 now what is atheism 20 well it starts from a very basic premise of course there 's no god of course there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels etc now let 's move on that 's not the end of the story that 's the 
 very very beginning i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines that thinks i cannot believe in any of this stuff i cannot believe in the doctrines i do n't think these doctrines are right but a very important but i love christmas 
 carols i really like the art of mantegna i really like looking at old churches i really like turning the pages of the old testament whatever it may be you know the kind of thing i 'm talking about people who are attracted to the ritualistic side the 
 moralistic communal side of religion but cannot bear the doctrine until now these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some 
 kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart so that 's a sort of tough choice i do n't think we have to make that choice i think there is an alternative i think there are ways and i 'm being both very respectful and completely 
 impious of stealing from religions if you do n't believe in a religion there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing with taking out the best sides of religion and for me atheism 20 is about both as i say a respectful and an impious way of going through 
 religions and saying what here could we use the secular world is full of holes we have secularized badly i would argue and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well and i'd like to 
 run through a few of these today i'd like to kick off by looking at education now education is a field the secular world really believes in when we think about how we 're going to make the world a better place we think education that 's where we 
 put a lot of money education is going to give us not only commercial skills industrial skills it 's also going to make us better people you know the kind of thing a commencement address is and graduation ceremonies those lyrical claims that education the process of education 
 particularly higher education will make us into nobler and better human beings that 's a lovely idea interesting where it came from in the early 19th century church attendance in western europe started sliding down very very sharply and people panicked they asked themselves the following question they said 
 where are people going to find the morality where are they going to find guidance and where are they going to find sources of consolation and influential voices came up with one answer they said culture it 's to culture that we should look for guidance for consolation for 
 morality let 's look to the plays of shakespeare the dialogues of plato the novels of jane austen in there we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john now i think that 's a very beautiful idea and 
 a very true idea they wanted to replace scripture with culture and that 's a very plausible idea it 's also an idea that we have forgotten if you went to a top university let 's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge and you said 
 i've come here because i 'm in search of morality guidance and consolation i want to know how to live they would show you the way to the insane asylum this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of why 
 they do n't think we need it they do n't think we are in an urgent need of assistance they see us as adults rational adults what we need is information we need data we do n't need help now religions start from a very different place indeed all 
 religions all major religions at various points call us children and like children they believe that we are in severe need of assistance we 're only just holding it together perhaps this is just me maybe you but anyway we 're only just holding it together and we need help 
 of course we need help and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning you know in the 18th century in the uk the greatest preacher greatest religious preacher was a man called john wesley who went up and down this country delivering sermons advising people how they 
 could live he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons the 
 classic medium of delivery of religions now we've given up with the idea of sermons if you said to a modern liberal individualist hey how about a sermon they'd go no no i do n't need one of those i 'm an independent individual person what 's the difference between 
 a sermon and our modern secular mode of delivery the lecture well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable 
 because we are in need of guidance morality and consolation and religions know that another point about education we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once they 'll remember it sit them in a classroom tell them about plato at the 
 age of 20 send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years and that lesson will stick with them religions go nonsense you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day so get on your knees and repeat it that 's what all religions 
 tell us get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day otherwise our minds are like sieves so religions are cultures of repetition they circle the great truths again and again and again we associate repetition with boredom give us the new 
 we 're always saying the new is better than the old if i said to you okay we 're not going to have new ted we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true we 're going to 
 watch elizabeth gilbert five times because what she says is so clever you'd feel cheated not so if you 're adopting a religious mindset the other things that religions do is to arrange time all the major religions give us calendars what is a calendar a calendar is a 
 way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas in the catholic chronology catholic calendar at the end of march you will think about st jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor you wo n't 
 do that by accident you will do that because you are guided to do that now we do n't think that way in the secular world we think if an idea is important i 'll bump into it i 'll just come across it nonsense says the religious world 
 view religious view says we need calendars we need to structure time we need to synchronize encounters this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings take the moon it 's really important to look at the moon you know when 
 you look at the moon you think i 'm really small what are my problems it sets things into perspective etc etc we should all look at the moon a bit more often we do n't why do n't we well there 's nothing to tell us look at the 
 moon but if you 're a zen buddhist in the middle of september you will be ordered out of your home made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon 
 and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of you 'll be handed rice cakes and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart that 's very good the other thing that religions are 
 really aware of is speak well i 'm not doing a very good job of this here but oratory oratory is absolutely key to religions in the secular world you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career but 
 the religious world does n't think that way what you 're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it so if you go to an african american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk my goodness they 
 talk well after every convincing point people will go amen amen amen at the end of a really rousing paragraph they 'll all stand up and they 'll go thank you jesus thank you christ thank you savior if we were doing it like they do it let 's not 
 do it but if we were to do it i would tell you something like culture should replace scripture and you would go amen amen amen and at the end of my talk you would all stand up and you would go thank you plato thank you shakespeare 
 thank you jane austen and we'd know that we had a real rhythm going all right all right we 're getting there we 're getting there the other thing that religions know is we 're not just brains we are also bodies and when they teach us a lesson 
 they do it via the body so for example take the jewish idea of forgiveness jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh they do n't just deliver us sermons on this they do n't just give us books or words about this 
 they tell us to have a bath so in orthodox jewish communities every friday you go to a mikveh you immerse yourself in the water and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea we do n't tend to do that our ideas are in one area and our 
 behavior with our bodies is in another religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two let 's look at art now now art is something that in the secular world we think very highly of we think art is really really important a lot of 
 our surplus wealth goes to museums etc we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches you've heard that saying now i think that the potential is there but we've completely let ourselves down and the reason we've let ourselves down is that 
 we 're not properly studying how religions handle art the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art the first idea is that art should be for art 's sake a ridiculous idea an idea that art 
 should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world i could n't disagree more the other thing that we believe is that art should n't explain itself that artists should n't say what they 're up to because if they said 
 it it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy that 's why a very common feeling when you 're in a museum let 's admit it is i do n't know what this is about but if we 're serious people we do n't admit 
 to that but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art now religions have a much saner attitude to art they have no trouble telling us what art is about art is about two things in all the major faiths firstly it 's trying to remind you of 
 what there is to love and secondly it 's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate and that 's what art is art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith so as you walk around a church 
 or a mosque or a cathedral what you 're trying to imbibe what you 're imbibing is through your eyes through your senses truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind essentially it 's propaganda rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view now the word propaganda sets 
 off alarm bells we think of hitler we think of stalin do n't necessarily propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something and if that thing is good there 's no problem with it at all my view is that museums should take a leaf out 
 of the book of religions and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum if i was a museum curator i would make a room for love a room for generosity all works of art are talking to us about things and if we were able 
 to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind we would get a lot more out of art art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we've 
 neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society art should be didactic let 's think of something else the people in the modern world in the secular world who are interested in matters of the spirit in 
 matters of the mind in higher soul-like concerns tend to be isolated individuals they 're poets they 're philosophers they 're photographers they 're filmmakers and they tend to be on their own they 're our cottage industries they are vulnerable single people and they get depressed and they get 
 sad on their own and they do n't really change much now think about religions think about organized religions what do organized religions do they group together they form institutions and that has all sorts of advantages first of all scale might the catholic church pulled in 97 billion 
 dollars last year according to the wall street journal these are massive machines they 're collaborative they 're branded they 're multinational and they 're highly disciplined these are all very good qualities we recognize them in relation to corporations and corporations are very like religions in many ways 
 except they 're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs they 're selling us shoes and cars whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff the therapists the poets are on their own and they have no power they have no might so 
 religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it books alone books written by lone individuals 
 are not going to change anything we need to group together if you want to change the world you have to group together you have to be collaborative and that 's what religions do they are multinational as i say they are branded they have a clear identity 
 so they do n't get lost in a busy world that 's something we can learn from i want to conclude really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields there is something to learn from the example of 
 religion even if you do n't believe any of it if you 're involved in anything that 's communal that involves lots of people getting together there are things for you in religion if you 're involved say in a travel industry in any way look at pilgrimage 
 look very closely at pilgrimage we have n't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we have n't looked at what religions do with travel if you 're in the art world look at the example of what religions are doing with art and if you 
 're an educator in any way again look at how religions are spreading ideas you may not agree with the ideas but my goodness they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so so really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion but at the end of 
 the day religions are so subtle so complicated so intelligent in many ways that they 're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone they 're for all of us thank you very much chris anderson now this is actually a courageous talk because you 're kind of 
 setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters ab you can get shot by both sides you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists and you can get shot by those who fully believe ca incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment ab 
 indeed ca but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from which is this sense that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious of spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that 
 's bigger than you are is there any room for that experience in atheism 20 ab absolutely i like many of you meet people who say things like but is n't there something bigger than us something else and i say of course and they say so are n't 
 you sort of religious and i go no why does that sense of mystery that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling science and just observation gives us that feeling without it so i do n't feel the need 
 the universe is large and we are tiny without the need for further religious superstructure so one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit ca actually let me just ask a question how many people here would say that religion is important to them is there an 
 equivalent process by which there 's a sort of bridge between what you 're talking about and what you would say to them ab i would say that there are many many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged it 's not as though as i try 
 to suggest it 's not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things or you do n't have religion and then you 're cut off from all these very good things it 's so sad that we constantly say i 
 do n't believe so i cannot have community so i 'm cut off from morality so i cannot go on a pilgrimage one wants to say nonsense why not and that 's really the spirit of my talk there 's so much we can absorb atheism should n't cut itself 
 off from the rich sources of religion ca it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists but probably most people in the community certainly do n't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the 
 language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and 
 war that there could be bridging ab no we need to be polite about differences politeness is a much-overlooked virtue it 's seen as hypocrisy but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says well you know i did pray the other 
 day you politely ignore it you move on because you've agreed on 90 percent of things because you have a shared view on so many things and you politely differ and i think that 's what the religious wars of late have ignored they've ignored the possibility of harmonious 
 disagreement ca and finally does this new thing that you 're proposing that 's not a religion but something else does it need a leader and are you volunteering to be the pope ab well one thing that we 're all very suspicious of is individual leaders it 
 does n't need it what i've tried to lay out is a framework and i 'm hoping that people can just fill it in i've sketched a sort of broad framework but wherever you are as i say if you 're in the travel industry do that travel bit 
 if you 're in the communal industry look at religion and do the communal bit so it 's a wiki project ca alain thank you for sparking many conversations later sometimes i go browsing through a very old magazine i found this observation test about the story of the ark 
 and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes -- there are more or less 12 mistakes some of them are very easy there is a funnel an aerial part a lamp and clockwork key on the ark some of them are about the 
 animals the number but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that 's not reported here and this problem is where are the plants so now we have god that is going to submerge earth permanently or at least for a very 
 long period and no one is taking care of plants noah needed to take two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal of every kind of creature that moves but no mention about plants why in another part of the same story all the living creatures 
 are just the living creatures that came out from the ark so birds livestock and wild animals plants are not living creatures -- this is the point that is a point that is not coming out from the bible but it 's something that really accompanied humanity let 
 's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description of the order of nature it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left you have the stones immediately after the stones the plants that are just able 
 to live we have the animals that are able to live and to sense and on the top of the pyramid there is the man this is not the common man the homo studiosus the studying man this is quite comforting for people like me i 'm a professor 
 this to be over there on the top of creation but it 's something completely wrong you know very well about professors but it 's also wrong about plants because plants are not just able to live they are able to sense they are much more sophisticated in sensing 
 than animals just to give you an example every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be 
 described just with the term of intelligence well but this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us let 's have a look at this short movie now we have david attenborough now david attenborough is really a plant lover he did some of 
 the most beautiful movies about plant behavior now when he speaks about plants everything is correct when he speaks about animals he tends to remove the fact that plants exist the blue whale the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong completely wrong the 
 blue whale it 's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful magnificent sequoiadendron giganteum and this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons now the story that plants are some low-level organisms has 
 been formalized many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for the western civilization wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living they have just a kind of very low-level soul it 's called the vegetative soul 
 because they lack movement and so they do n't need to sense let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well-known this is a very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails -- sorry for the snail this 
 has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal because it was against the order of nature but plants are also able to show a lot of movement some of them are very well 
 known like the flowering it 's just a question to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time and it 's really so graceful it 's like a dancing 
 angel they are also able to play -- they are really playing these are young sunflowers and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing they are training themselves as many young animals do to the adult life where they will be called to 
 track the sun all the day they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the vector of gravity but they are also able to sleep this is one mimosa pudica so during the night 
 they curl the leaves and reduce the movement and during the day you have the opening of the leaves there is much more movement this is interesting because this sleeping machinery it 's perfectly conserved it 's the same in plants in insects and in animals and so if 
 you need to study this sleeping problem it 's easy to study on plants for example than in animals and it 's much more easy even ethically it 's a kind of vegetarian experimentation plants are even able to communicate -- they are extraordinary communicators they communicate with other 
 plants they are able to distinguish kin and non-kin they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles for example during the pollination now with the pollination it 's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one 
 flower to the other yet they cannot move from one flower to the other so they need a vector and this vector it 's normally an animal many insects have been used by plants as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds 
 reptiles and mammals like bats rats are normally used for the transportation of the pollen this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance very energizing having in change this transportation of the pollen but some plants are manipulating 
 animals like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen now there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen how is it possible to do this without a brain we 
 need to wait until 1880 when this big man charles darwin publishes a wonderful astonishing book that starts a revolution the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin in his book assisted by his son 
 francis who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages and in the last paragraph of the book it 's a kind of stylistic mark because normally charles darwin stored in the last paragraph of a 
 book the most important message he wrote that it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was 
 jd hooker or at that time president of the royal society so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants now this is a root apex growing against a slope so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms 
 snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display and it 's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain 
 so we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here depicted in blue that is called the transition zone and this region it 's a very small region -- it 's less than one millimeter and in this small region you have 
 the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have these kinds of signals here the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to exchange information now we know that 
 a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye we have almost 14 million roots we have 11 and a half million root apex and a 
 total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with all the others here were have on the left the internet and on the right the root apparatus they work in the 
 same way they are a network of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar because they evolved for the same reason to survive predation they work in the same way so you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants continue 
 to work you can remove 90 percent of the internet and it is continuing to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evolve networks and another possibility is a technological possibility let 's imagine that 
 we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants until now the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot we have the animaloid and the normal robots inspired by animals insectoid so on we have the androids that are inspired by 
 man but why have we not any plantoid well if you want to fly it 's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want to explore soils or if you want to colonize new territory to best thing that you can do 
 is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this we have another possibility we are working on in our lab which is to build hybrids it 's much more easy to build hybrids hybrid means it 's something that 's half living and half machine 
 it 's much more easy to work with plants than with animals they have computing power they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even ethically possible and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids driven by algae 
 or by the leaves at the end by the most most powerful parts of the plants by the roots well thank you for your attention and before i finish i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation thank you /transcript the story i 
 wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an iranian artist as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile well it has its pluses and minuses on the dark side politics does n't seem to escape people like me every iranian artist 
 in one form or another is political politics have defined our lives if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship harassment arrest torture at times execution if you 're living outside like me you 're faced with life in exile the pain of the longing and the 
 separation from your loved ones and your family therefore we do n't find the moral emotional psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility oddly enough an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice the speaker of 
 my people even if i have indeed no access to my own country also people like myself we 're fighting two battles on different grounds we 're being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity about the image that is constructed about us 
 about our women about our politics about our religion we are there to take pride and insist on respect and at the same time we 're fighting another battle that is our regime our government our atrocious government that has done every crime in order to stay in power 
 our artists are at risk we are in a position of danger we pose a threat to the order of the government but ironically this situation has empowered all of us because we are considered as artists central to the cultural political social discourse in iran we are there to 
 inspire to provoke to mobilize to bring hope to our people we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world art is our weapon culture is a form of resistance i envy sometimes the artists of the west for their freedom of expression 
 for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly the western culture but also i worry about the west because often in this country in this western world that we have culture risks being a 
 form of entertainment our people depend on our artists and culture is beyond communication my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place i did not start to make social commentary about my country the first one that you see in front of you is actually 
 when i first returned to iran after being separated for a good 12 years it was after the islamic revolution of 1979 while i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture i 
 came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society but instead i found a country that was totally ideological and that i did n't recognize anymore more so i became very interested as i was facing my 
 own personal dilemmas and questions i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution how indeed it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran historically seemed to embody the political transformation 
 so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject of 
 martyrdom the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of god faith but violence and crime and cruelty for me this became incredibly important and yet i had an unusual position toward this i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find 
 my place but i was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i did n't know i would discover so my art became slightly more critical 
 my knife became a little sharper and i fell into a life in exile i am a nomadic artist i work in morocco in turkey in mexico i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran now i am making films last year i finished a film called women 
 without men women without men returns to history but another part of our iranian history it goes to 1953 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr. mossadegh the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur it 's a magical realist novel 
 this book is banned and she spent five years in prison my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female traditionally historically in iran and the question of four women who 
 are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran equally as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to 
 speak to the westerners about our history as a country that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution that iran was once a secular society and we had democracy and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government by the british government 
 this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized in the way we looked in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life and most of all in the way 
 that we fought for democracy these are some of the shots actually from my film these are some of the images of the coup and we made this film in casablanca recreating all the shots this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but 
 also a feminine story being a visual artist indeed i am foremost interested to make art to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism and become an important timeless universal work of art the challenge i have is how to do that how to tell a political 
 story but an allegorical story how to move you with your emotions but also make your mind work these are some of the images and the characters of the film now comes the green movement the summer of 2009 as my film is released the uprising begins in the 
 streets of tehran what is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film the cry for democracy and social justice repeats itself now again in tehran the green movement significantly inspired the world it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who 
 stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy what was most significant for me was once again the presence of the women they 're absolutely inspirational for me if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and did n't have a voice 
 now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran women who were educated forward thinking non-traditional sexually open fearless and seriously feminist these women and those young men united iranians across the world inside and outside i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from 
 iranian women that under all circumstances they have pushed the boundary they have confronted the authority they have broken every rule in the smallest and the biggest way and once again they proved themselves i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and 
 their voice is giving me my voice and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist even if i have to operate in the west only for now thank you so much so i want to tell you a story an encouraging story 
 about addressing desperation depression and despair in afghanistan and what we have learned from it and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead in the future and how to participate again in everyday life so 
 i am a jungian psychoanalyst and i went to afghanistan in january 2004 by chance on an assignment for medica mondiale jung in afghanistan you get the picture afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and 70 percent of the people are illiterate war and malnutrition kills 
 people together with hope you may know this from the media but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old which means they grow up in such an environment and i repeat myself in 30 years of war 
 so this translates into ongoing violence foreign interests bribery drugs ethnic conflicts bad health shame fear and cumulative traumatic experiences local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations and people had hope yes but until they realized their situation 
 worsens every day either because they are being killed or because somehow they are poorer than eight years ago one figure for that 54 percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition yet there is hope one day a man told me my 
 future does not look brilliant but i want to have a brilliant future for my son this is a picture i took in 2005 walking on fridays over the hills in kabul and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation so 
 doctors prescribe medication and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads military collect weapons and depression stays intact why because people do n't have tools to cope with it to get over it so soon after my arrival i had confirmed something which i had already 
 known that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe yes however what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds they are universal and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context after a counseling session 
 a woman said to me because you have felt me i can feel myself again and i want to participate again in my family life this was very important because the family is central in afghans social system no one can survive alone and if people feel used worthless 
 and ashamed because something horrible has happened to them then they retreat and they fall into social isolation and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones because they do not want to burden them and very often violence is a way 
 to cope with it traumatized people also easily lose control symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks so people are in a constant fear that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly suddenly and they cannot control it to compensate this loss of inner control 
 they try to control the outside very understandably mostly the family and unfortunately this fits very well into the traditional side regressive side repressive side restrictive side of the cultural context so husbands start beating wives mothers and fathers beat their children and afterward they feel awful they did not 
 want to do this it just happened -- they lost control the desperate try to restore order and normality and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt and partly this is already happening 
 so everybody needs a sense for the future and the afghan sense of the future is shattered but let me repeat the words of the woman because you have felt me i can feel myself again so the key here is empathy somebody has to be a witness to what 
 has happened to you somebody has to feel how you felt and somebody has to see you and listen to you everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true and this only goes with another person so everybody must be able to say 
 this happened to me and it did this with me but i 'm able to live with it to cope with it and to learn from it and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children and i will 
 not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter, what happens too often in afghanistan so something can be done even in such extreme environments as afghanistan and i started thinking about a counseling program but of course i needed help and funds and one evening i was sitting next to a 
 very nice gentleman in kabul and he asked what i thought would be good in afghanistan and i explained to him quickly i would train psycho-social counselors i would open centers and i explained to him why this man gave me his contact details at the end of the 
 evening and said if you want to do this call me at that time it was the head of caritas germany so i was able to launch a three-year project with caritas germany and we trained 30 afghan women and men and we opened 15 counseling centers in kabul 
 this was our sign it 's hand-painted and we had 45 all over kabul eleven thousand people came more than that and 70 percent regained their lives this was a very exciting time developing this with my wonderful afghan team and they are working with me up to today 
 we developed a culturally-sensitive psycho-social counseling approach so from 2008 up until today a substantial change and step forward has been taking place the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health to lobby this approach -- 
 we succeeded we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system this means certainly to retrain all health staff but for that we already have the training manuals which are approved by the ministry and moreover 
 this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces and you are the first to see the results we wanted to know if what is being done is effective and here you can 
 see the patients all had symptoms of depression moderate and severe and the red line is the treatment as usual medication with a medical doctor and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse and the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only without medication 
 and you can see the symptoms almost completely go away and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly which is explicable because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses but you can learn how to cope with them so this makes us very happy because now we also have some evidence 
 that this is working so here you see this is a health facility in northern afghanistan and every morning it looks like this all over and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients but now this will change they go to the clinics because they want 
 to cure their immediate symptoms and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions develop their resources learn tools to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future and i would like to 
 share one short vignette one hazara said to his pashtun counselor if we were to have met some years ago then we would have killed each other and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future and another counselor said to me after the training 
 you know i never knew why i survived the killings in my village but now i know because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan so i believe this kept me running and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace 
 and reconciliation and also i think without psycho-social therapy and without considering this in all humanitarian projects we cannot build-up civil societies i thought it was an idea worth spreading and i think it must be can be could be replicated elsewhere i thank you for your attention 
 well good morning ladies and gentlemen my name is art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my loves of math and magic to do something i call mathemagics but before i get started i have a quick question for the audience by any chance 
 did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand raise your hand i was your hand go up now bring it out bring it out anybody else i see i see one way in the back 
 you sir that 's three and anybody on this side here ok you over there on the aisle would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage and let 's give these volunteers a nice round of applause that 
 's right now since i have n't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please how about a two-digit number audience 22 arthur benjamin 22 and 
 another two-digit number sir audience 47 ab multiply 22 times 47 make sure you get 1,034 or the calculators are not working do all of you get 1,034 1,034 woman no ab 594 let 's give three of them a nice round of applause there would you like to try 
 a more standard calculator just in case ok great what i 'm going to try and do then i notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that 's ok i 'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the 
 calculator there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself for instance five squared would be audience 25 ab 25 now the way we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one 
 is by taking the number such as five hitting times and then equals and on most calculators that will give you the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do the calculation even faster what 
 i 'm going to try and do now is to square in my head four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators even using the shortcut method what i 'll use is the second row this time and i 'll get four of you one two 
 three four to each yell out a two-digit number and if you would square the first number and if you would square the second the third and the fourth i will try and race you to the answer ok so quickly a two-digit number please audience 37 ab 37 
 squared ok audience 23 ab 23 squared ok audience 59 ab 59 squared ok and finally audience 93 ab 93 squared would you call out your answers please woman 1369 ab 1369 woman 529 ab 529 man 3481 ab 3481 man 8649 ab thank you very much let me try 
 to take this one step further i 'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time i wo n't even write these down i 'll just call them out as they 're called out to me anyone i point to call out a three-digit number anyone 
 on our panel verify the answer just give some indication if it 's right a three-digit number sir yes audience 987 ab 987 squared is 974,169 yes good another another three-digit another three-digit number sir audience 457 ab 457 squared is 205,849 205,849 yes ok another another three-digit number 
 sir audience 321 ab 321 is 103,041 103,041 yes one more three-digit number please audience oh 722 ab 722 is 500 ooh that 's a harder one is that 513,284 woman yes ab yes oh one more one more three-digit number please audience 162 162 squared is 26,244 thank 
 you very much let me try to take this one step further i 'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not beat you to the answer on this one but i will try to get 
 the answer right to make this a little bit more random let 's take the fourth row this time let 's say one two three four if each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine that will be the four-digit number that i 'll 
 square audience nine ab nine audience seven ab seven audience five ab five audience eight ab eight 9,758 this will take me a little bit of time so bear with me 95,218,564 woman yes ab thank you very much now i would attempt to square a five-digit number 
 and i can but unfortunately most calculators cannot eight-digit capacity do n't you hate that so since we've reached the limits of our calculators what 's that does yours go woman i do n't know ab does yours go higher oh yours does man i can probably do it 
 ab i 'll talk to you later in the meanwhile let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier let 's take the largest number on the board here 8649 would you each enter that on your calculator and instead of squaring it this 
 time i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want but do n't tell me what you 're multiplying by just multiply it by any random three-digit number so you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a 
 seven-digit number how many digits do you have six or seven seven and yours woman seven ab seven seven and uncertain man yeah ab seven is there any possible way that i could know what seven digit numbers you have say no good then i shall attempt the impossible 
 or at least the improbable what i'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits any six of them in any order you'd like one digit at a time i shall try and determine the digit you've left out 
 so starting with your seven-digit number call out any six of them please woman one ok 197042 ab did you leave out the number 6 woman yes ab good ok that 's one you have a seven-digit number call out any six of them please woman 44875 ab 
 i think i only heard five numbers i wait 44875 did you leave out the number 6 woman yes ab same as she did ok you've got a seven-digit number call out any six of them loud and clear man 079044 ab i think you left out the number 3 
 that 's three the odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 10 to the fourth power ok any six of them really scramble them up this time please man 263972 ab did you leave out the number 7 
 and let 's give all four of these people a nice round of applause thank you very much for my next number while i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience by any chance does anybody here happen to know the day of the week 
 that they were born on if you think you know your birth day raise your hand let 's see starting with let 's start with a gentleman first ok sir what year was it first of all that 's why i start with a gentleman first what year 
 audience 1953 ab 1953 and the month audience november ab november what audience 23rd ab 23rd was that a monday audience yes yes good somebody else who else would like see i do n't have n't seen any women 's hands up ok it 's how about you what 
 year audience 1949 ab 1949 and the month audience october ab october what audience fifth ab fifth was that a wednesday yes my i 'll go way to the back right now how about you yell it out what year audience 1959 ab 1959 ok and the month audience 
 february ab february what audience sixth ab sixth was that a friday audience yes good how about the person behind her call call what year was it audience 1947 ab 1947 and the month audience may ab may what audience seventh ab seventh would that be a wednesday audience 
 yes ab thank you very much anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born we can do it that way of course i could just make up an answer and you would n't know so i come prepared for that i brought with me 
 a book of calendars it goes as far back into the past as 1800 cause you never know i did n't mean to look at you sir you were just sitting there anyway chris you can help me out here if you would n't mind this is a book 
 of calendars and i 'll ask who was it that wanted to know their birth day you sir ok what year was it first of all audience 1966 ab 66 turn to the calendar with 1966 and what month audience april ab april what audience 17th ab 17th 
 i believe that was a sunday can you confirm chris chris anderson yes ab yeah ok i 'll tell you what chris as long as you have that book in front of you do me a favor turn to a year outside of the 1900s either into the 1800s or 
 way into the 2000s that 'll be a much greater challenge for me what year chris would you like ca 1824 ab 1824 ok and what month ca june ab june what ca sixth ab sixth was that a sunday ca it was ab and it was cloudy 
 good thank you very much but i'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation there was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator where is he would you stand up 10-digit guy ok well stand up for me just for 
 a second so i can see where you are ok oh ok you have a 10-digit calculator sir as well ok what i 'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator but to make my job more interesting 
 for you as well as for me i 'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly hear what 's going on in my mind while i do a calculation of this size now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green 
 i know as a magician we 're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i 'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week so i think we 're ok so let 's see let 's take a let 's take a different 
 row of people starting with you i 'll get five digits one two three four oh i did this row already let 's do the row before you starting with you sir one two three four five call out a single digit that will be the five-digit number that 
 i will try to square go ahead audience five ab five audience seven ab seven audience six ab six audience eight ab eight audience three ab three 57,683 squared yuck let me explain to you how i 'm going to attempt this problem i 'm going to break the 
 problem down into three parts i 'll do 57,000 squared plus 683 squared plus 57,000 times 683 times two add all those numbers together and with any luck arrive at the answer now let me recap thank you while i explain something else i know that you can use 
 right while i do these calculations you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is this is a phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me to convert numbers into words i store them as words 
 and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds complicated it 's not i just do n't want you to think you 're seeing something out of rain man here there 's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely sorry if you want to talk to 
 me about adhd afterwards you can talk to me then all right by the way one last instruction for my judges with the calculators ok you know who you are there is at least a 50 percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do 
 do n't tell me what the mistake is just say you 're close or something like that and i 'll try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself if however i am right whatever you do do n't keep it to yourself ok make 
 sure everybody knows that i got the answer right because this is my big finish ok so without any more stalling here we go i 'll start the problem in the middle with 57 times 683 now 57 times 68 is 3,400 plus 476 is 3876 that 's 38,760 plus 
 171 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 38,931 double that to get 77,862 77,862 becomes cookie fission cookie fission is 77,822 that seems right i 'll go on cookie fission ok next i do 57 squared which is 3,249 so i can say three billion take the 249 add 
 that to cookie 249 oops but i see a carry coming 249 add that to cookie 250 plus 77 is 327 million fission fission ok finally we do 683 squared that 's 700 times 666 plus 17 squared is 466,489 rev up if i need it rev up take 
 the 466 add that to fission to get oh gee 328,489 audience yeah ab good thank you very much i hope you enjoyed mathemagics thank you four years ago on the ted stage i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo and because of that 
 announcement we got a big article in the new york times which led to more press which led to more attention and me deciding to become ceo of that company whereas i was just an adviser and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring one 
 of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey and a year later we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo and jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to 
 friends we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo so we kind of put two and two together and in early 2006 we launched twitter as a side project at odeo now it 's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup where 
 focus is so critical but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side and it ended up taking over not only the company but my life over the next five or six years 
 so i learned to follow hunches even though you cannot necessarily justify them or know where they 're going to go and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter time after time so for those of you unfamiliar twitter is based around a very simple seemingly 
 trivial concept you say what you 're doing in 140 characters or less and people who are interested in you get those updates if they 're really interested they get the update as a text message on their cell phone so for instance i may twitter right now that i 
 'm giving a talk at ted it 's a normal everyday thing and in my case when i hit send up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds now the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they 
 want be they momentous occasions or mundane ones it is by sharing these moments as they 're happening that lets people feel more connected and in touch despite distance and in real time this was the primary use we saw for twitter from the beginning and what got us 
 excited what we did n't anticipate was the many many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system one of the things we realized was how important twitter could be during real-time events when the wildfires broke out in san diego in october of 2007 people 
 turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them but it was n't just individuals the la times actually turned to twitter to dispense information as well and put a twitter feed on the front page and the la 
 fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well at this event dozens of people are twittering and thousands of people are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what 's happening among the other interesting 
 things that have cropped up are many things from businesses from marketing and communications and predictable things to an insanely popular korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around la and twitters where it stops causing a line to form around the block politicians have recently begun twittering in fact 
 there are 47 members of congress who currently have twitter accounts and they 're tweeting in some cases from behind closed-door sessions with the president in this case this guy 's not liking what he 's hearing the president himself is our most popular twitter user although his tweets have 
 dropped off as of late while senator mccain 's have picked up as have this guy 's twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody and you receive the messages you 're interested in one of the many ways 
 that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message so this syntax the @username that shaquille o'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans was completely invented by users and we did n't 
 build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system another is via the api we built an application-programming interface which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts 
 with twitter we currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send twitter updates interfaces for mac windows your iphone your blackberry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks or a plant twitter when it needs water 
 probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in virginia called summize summize built a twitter search engine and they tapped into the fact that if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them 
 you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it 's going on this really changed how we perceived twitter for instance here 's what people are saying about ted this is another way that our mind was shifted and twitter was n't what we 
 thought it was we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product this not only lets you view twitters in different ways but it introduces new use cases as well one of my favorites is what happened a few months 
 ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas where it was and how much it cost and then appended the keyword #atlgas so that other people search for that and find gas themselves and this trend 
 of people using this communication network to help each other out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends it 's happened more and more lately whether it 's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa or for a 
 family in crisis people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter in a matter of days on several occasions it seems like when you give people easier ways to share information more good things happen i have no idea what will happen next with twitter i've 
 learned to follow the hunch but never assume where it will go thanks chris anderson we 're not quite done yet so look if we could have this screen live this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they've been to an event it 
 's totally intimidating so this would be the twitter search screen let 's type a couple of random words into twitter for example evan williams give people more information and follow your hunch @ #ted currently listening to evan williams oh evan williams is just dying on stage here at 
 ted worst talk ever evan williams nice thanks ca just kidding but literally in the eight minutes he was talking there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk so he 'll see every aspect of the reaction the fact that barack obama is the biggest twitterer 
 the fact that it came out of ted i do n't think there 's any other way of getting instant feedback that way you have build something very fascinating and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it so thank you very much evan that 
 was very interesting ew thank you well first of all let me thank emeka as a matter of fact ted global for putting this conference together this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century think african governments will put together a 
 conference like this you think the au will put together a conference like this even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid i would also like to pay homage and honor to the ted fellows june arunga james shikwati andrew and the other ted fellows 
 i call them the cheetah generation the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption they understand what accountability and democracy is they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them that 's the cheetah generation and africa 's salvation 
 rests on the backs of these cheetahs in contrast of course we have the hippo generation the hippo generation are the ruling elites they are stuck in their intellectual patch complaining about colonialism and imperialism they would n't move one foot if you ask them to reform the economies 
 they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry at the condition of africa now we 're talking about a continent that is not poor it is rich in mineral resources 
 natural mineral resources but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty that 's what makes a lot of africans very angry and in a way africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one there 's another enduring 
 tragedy and that tragedy is that there are so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in africa they do n't understand now we 're not saying do n't help africa helping africa is noble but helping africa has been turned into 
 a theater of the absurd it 's like the blind leading the clueless there are certain things that we need to recognize africa 's begging-bowl leaks did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa it 's taken out of 
 africa that 's what the world bank says look at africa 's begging-bowl it leaks horribly there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks what are the leakages corruption alone costs africa 148 billion dollars a year yes 
 put that aside capital flight out of africa 80 billion a year put that aside let 's take food imports every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food just add that up all these leakages that 's far more than the 50 billion tony blair wants to raise 
 for africa now back in the 1960s africa not only fed itself it also exported food not anymore we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day 
 here let 's move on and flip over to the next chapter and that 's what this conference is all about the next chapter the next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question whom do we want to help in africa there is the people 
 and then there is the government or leaders now the previous speaker before me idris mohammed indicated that we've had abysmal leadership in africa that characterization in my view is even more charitable i belong to an internet discussion forum an african internet discussion forum and i asked them 
 i said since 1960 we've had exactly 204 african heads of state since 1960 and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders just 20 good leaders you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just 20 everybody mentioned nelson 
 mandela of course kwame nkrumah nyerere kenyatta somebody mentioned idi amin i let that pass my point is they could n't go beyond 15 even if they had been able to name me 20 what does that tell you 20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of 
 the african leaders failed their people and if you look at them the slate of the post-colonial leaders an assortment of military fufu heads swiss-bank socialists crocodile liberators vampire elites quack revolutionaries now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries 
 the second false premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people serves the interests of the people and represents the people there is one particular quote 
 a lesotho chief once said that here in lesotho we've got two problems rats and the government what you and i understand as a government does n't exist in many african countries in fact what we call our governments are vampire states vampires because they suck the economic vitality out 
 of their people government is the problem in africa a vampire state is the government which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else the richest people in africa 
 are heads-of-state and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself where do they get their money by creating wealth no by raking it off the backs of their suffering people that 's not wealth creation it 's wealth redistribution the third fundamental issue that we 
 have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people we must know where the african people are take any african economy an african economy can be broken up into three sectors there is the modern sector there is the informal sector and the traditional sector 
 the modern sector is the abode of the elites it 's the seat of government in many african countries the modern sector is lost it 's dysfunctional it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves do n't understand that is the source of many of 
 africa 's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector claiming innocent lives now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into more than 80 percent of ivory coast 
 's development went into the modern sector the other sectors the informal and the traditional sectors are where you find the majority of the african people the real people in africa that 's where you find them now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help 
 the people you go where the people are but that 's not what we did as a matter of fact we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture which is one of the reasons why africa cannot feed itself 
 and that 's why it must import food all right you cannot develop africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors and you cannot develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work these two sectors let me describe to you 
 have their own indigenous institutions first one is the political system traditionally africans hate governments they hate tyranny if you look into their traditional systems africans organize their states in two types the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous 
 so they did n't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority these societies are the ibo the somali the kikuyus for example they have no chiefs the other ethnic groups which did have chiefs made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils 
 to prevent them from abusing their power in ashanti tradition for example the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders without the council the chief cannot pass any law and if the chief does n't govern according to the will of the people 
 he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up a new settlement and even if you look in ancient african empires they were all organized around one particular principle the confederacy principle which is characterized by a great deal of 
 devolution of authority decentralization of power now this is what i have described to you this is part of africa 's indigenous political heritage now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa it is a total far cry in the economic system in traditional 
 africa the means of production is privately owned it 's owned by extended families you see in the west the basic economic and social unit is the individual the american will say i am because i am and i can damn well do anything i want anytime the 
 accent is on the i in africa the africans say i am because we are the we connotes community the extended family system the extended family system pools its resources together they own farms they decide what to do what to produce they do n't take any orders from their 
 chiefs they decide what to do and when they produce their crops they sell the surplus on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them so in a nutshell what we had in traditional africa was a 
 free-market system there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent timbuktu was one great big market town kano salaga they were all there even if you go to west africa you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women 
 so it 's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace the market is not alien to africa what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets capitalism became a western institution and the leaders said africans were ready 
 for socialism nonsense and even then what kind of socialism did they practice the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss-bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa 's treasuries for deposit in switzerland that is not the 
 kind of system africans had known for centuries what do we do now go back to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors the traditional sectors that 's where you find the african people and i'd like to 
 show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boat-building that i myself tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in could you please show that the men are going fishing in these small boats yes it 's an enterprise this is by a 
 local ghanaian entrepreneur using his own capital he 's getting no assistance from the government and he 's building a second bigger boat a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians it also means 
 that he will be able to generate wealth and then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy all that you need to do all that the elites need to do is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation 
 can be made more efficient now it is not just this informal sector there is also traditional medicine 80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed now this is an area i mean there is a treasure trove of wealth in 
 the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within 
 we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana and i know that with the cheetahs we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much you will understand nothing with my type of 
 english it 's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people i must tell you i am like that not very comfortable because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i feel useless now after carolyn and 
 all the other guys i feel like shit and definitively i do n't know why i am here but you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you you must sing i do n't know so so 
 because i have nothing to show nothing to say we shall try to speak about something else we can start if you want by understanding it 's just to start it 's not interesting but how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known 
 i mean yes lemon squeezer toilet brush toothpick beautiful toilet seats and why not a toothbrush i do n't try to design the toothbrush i do n't try to say oh that will be a beautiful object or something like that that does n't interest me because there is 
 different types of design the one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the 50s who said what is ugly is a bad sale la laideur se vend mal which is terrible it means the design must be just the 
 weapon for marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more it 's shit it 's obsolete it 's ridiculous i call that the cynical design after there is the narcissistic design it 's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers 
 after there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try i try to not make the object for the object but for the result for the profit 
 for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush i do n't think about the toothbrush i think what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth 
 i must imagine who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth in what society does this guy live what civilization creates this society what animal species creates this civilization when i arrive and i take one minute i am not so intelligent 
 when i arrive at the level of animal species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not do it it 's more positive than do it 
 or how i shall do it but to come back where i am at the animal species there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us because there is not a human production which exists outside of 
 what i call the big image the big image is our story our poetry our romanticism our poetry is our mutation our life we must remember and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old that life appears four billion years ago 
 around four billion point two voice offstage four point five yes point five ok ok ok i 'm a designer that 's all of christmas gifts and before there was this soup called soupe primordiale this first soup bloop bloop bloop sort of dirty mud no life nothing so 
 then pshoo-shoo lightning pshoo arrive pshoo-shoo makes life bloop bloop and that dies some million years after pshoo-shoo bloop-bloop ah wake up at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce 
 you know what i mean and something of oh no forget it after we become a fish after we become a frog after we become a monkey after we become what we are today a super-monkey and the fun is the super-monkey we are today is at half of the 
 story can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod four billion years and we know and especially carolyn knows that when the sun will implode the earth will burn explode i do n't know what and this is scheduled 
 for four four billion years yes she said something like that ok that means we are at half of the story fantastic it 's a beauty can you imagine it 's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today and today 
 we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry that is our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu-ta-tion we are mutants and if we do n't deeply understand if we do n't integrate that we are 
 mutants we completely miss the story because every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know i am the man the final man you know we mutate during four billion years before but now because it 's me 
 we stop fin for the end for the eternity it is one with a red jacket something like that i am not sure of that because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many things to do it 's so fresh and 
 here is something nobody is obliged to be a genius but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want there is so many but one which is very 
 easy to do is the duty of vision i can explain you i shall try if you walk like that it 's ok it 's ok you can walk but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole 
 and you will fall and you will die dangerous that 's why perhaps you will try to have this angle of vision ok i can see if i found something up up and they continue up up up i raise the angle of vision but it 's still very 
 selfish selfish egoiste yes selfish you you survive it 's ok if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can help you i can design for you a new toothbrush new 
 toilet brush something like that i live in society i live in community it 's ok you start to be in the territory of intelligence we can say from this level the more you can raise this angle of view the more you will be important for the society 
 the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation that means intelligent people are in this angle that is intelligence 
 from this to here that it 's genius ptolemy eratosthenes einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody take care in this training to be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap the vertical because 
 at the vertical of us if you look like that ah my god there is god ah god god is a trap god is the answer when we do n't know the answer that means when your brain is not enough big when you do n't understand you go 
 ah it 's god it 's god that 's ridiculous that 's why jump like that no do n't jump come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself 
 it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also that 's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget like that like that it 's very very very important 
 what what else we can say about that why do that it 's because we if we look from far we see our line of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens like 
 that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it 's made of light and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria and it 's very important to know where we are because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have 
 not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle that means we can imagine i do n't say it was fantastic but in the 80s there was not too much war like that it was we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized in this case 
 people like me are acceptable we can say it 's luxurious time we have time to think we have time to i do n't know what speak about art and things like that it 's ok we are in the light but sometimes like today we fall we 
 fall so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria with many many many many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria we have today it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think there is different type of barbaria that 's why we must adapt 
 that means when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful hotel forget design even i 'm sorry to say forget art forget all that there is priority there is urgency you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i 'm sorry if 
 that 's not very english you must go back to fight to battle that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job that 's why i am here to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best 
 possible that 's why i 'm the best it 's nothing because it 's not the right time that 's why i say that i say that because i repeat nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason the reason of our beautiful dream of this civilization 
 and because we must all work to finish this story because the scenario of this civilization about love progress and things like that it 's ok but there is so many different other scenarios of other civilizations this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like 
 this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story that is very very important and when you do n't understand really what 's happened you cannot go and fight and work and build 
 and things like that you go to the future back back back back like that and you can fall and it 's very dangerous no you must really understand that because we have almost finished i 'll repeat this story and the beauty of this in perhaps 50 years 
 60 years we can finish completely this civilization and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism with billions of people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much we 
 have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things we can say to our children ok done that was our story that passed now you have a duty invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea 
 about the next story we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do it that 's why i continue to work even if it 's for toilet brush this song is one of thomas favorites called what you do with 
 what you've got you must know someone like him he was tall and strong and lean with a body like a greyhound and a mind so sharp and keen but his heart just like laurel grew twisted around itself till almost everything he did brought pain to someone else 
 it 's not just what you 're born with it 's what you choose to bear it 's not how big your share is it 's how much you can share it 's not the fights you dreamed of it 's those you really fought it 's not what 
 you've been given it 's what you do with what you've got what 's the use of two strong legs if you only run away and what 's the use of the finest voice if you've nothing good to say what 's the use of strength and muscle if 
 you only push and shove and what 's the use of two good ears if you cannot hear those you love what 's the use of two strong legs if you only run away and what 's the use of the finest voice if you've nothing good to say 
 what 's the use of strength and muscle if you only push and shove and what 's the use of two good ears if you cannot hear those you love between those who use their neighbors and those who use the cane between those in constant power and those 
 in constant pain between those who run to glory and those who cannot run tell me which ones are the cripples and which ones touch the sun which ones touch the sun which ones touch the sun /transcript if you take 10,000 people at random 9,999 have something in 
 common their interests in business lie on or near the earth 's surface the odd one out is an astronomer and i am one of that strange breed my talk will be in two parts i 'll talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of 
 the human race but let 's start off by remembering that darwin showed how we 're the outcome of four billion years of evolution and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning to set our earth in a 
 cosmic context and let me just run through a few slides this was the impact that happened last week on a comet if they'd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday so that 's another project for nasa that 
 's mars from the european mars express and at new year this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan saturn 's giant moon it landed on the surface this is pictures taken on the way down that looks like a coastline it is indeed 
 but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade if we go beyond our solar system we've learned that the stars are n't twinkly points of light each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it and we can see places where 
 stars are forming like the eagle nebula we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems 
 where gas is being recycled and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large-scale universe this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about 100 patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky 
 through a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds of little faint smudges each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us the stars in those galaxies 
 probably do n't have planets around them there 's scant chance of life there that 's because there 's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life we believe that all of this 
 emerged from a big bang a hot dense state so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos i 'm going to show you a movie simulation 16 powers of 10 faster than real time which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have 
 subtracted out but you see as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small dense irregularities and structures develop and we 'll end up after 13 billion years with something looking rather like our own universe and we compare 
 simulated universes like that i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we actually see in the sky well we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the big bang but we still do n't know what banged and why 
 it banged that 's a challenge for 21st-century science if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here an ouroboros where you see the micro-world on the left the world of the quantum and on the right the large-scale universe of planets stars and galaxies 
 we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together and as we've learned in the last few years galaxies 
 are held together by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei but we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro-world of the quantum is understood on the right hand side gravity holds sway einstein 
 explained that but the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture and until we have that synthesis we wo n't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe 
 because when our universe was itself the size of an atom quantum effects could shake everything and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we do n't yet have one idea incidentally and i had this hazard sign to say i 
 'm going to speculate from now on is that our big bang was not the only one one idea is that our three-dimensional universe may be embedded in a high-dimensional space just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper you can imagine ants on one of them 
 thinking it 's a two-dimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours but we 're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension and we 're 
 imprisoned in our three and so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we've normally called our universe the aftermath of our big bang and here 's another picture bottom right depicts our universe which on the horizon is not beyond that 
 but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to many big bangs from one big 
 bang perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties well let 's go back to this picture there 's one challenge symbolized at the top but there 's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom you want to not only synthesize the very large and 
 the very small but we want to understand the very complex and the most complex things are ourselves midway between atoms and stars we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure we clearly have to be 
 large compared to atoms to have layer upon layer of complex structure we clearly have to be small compared to stars and planets otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there 
 are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here well most of you anyway the science of complexity is probably the greatest 
 challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right and it 's this science which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever and more than that 
 it 's engendering new kinds of change and i now move on to the second part of my talk and the book our final century was mentioned if i was not a self-effacing brit i would mention the book myself and i would add that it 's available in paperback 
 and in america it was called our final hour because americans like instant gratification but my theme is that in this century not only has science changed the world faster than ever but in new and different ways targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence perhaps even implants into our 
 brains may change human beings themselves and human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands of years it may change this century it 's new in our history and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth is unprecedented 
 too and so this makes this coming century a challenge bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources but they will have a dark side in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic or 
 some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure error rather than terror and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence in fact 
 some years ago bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc i do n't go along with all that but it 's interesting that he had a simple solution it was what he called fine-grained relinquishment he wanted to give up the dangerous kind 
 of science and keep the good bits now that 's absurdly naive for two reasons first any scientific discovery has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be 
 and so what this means is that we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science we have to accept that there will be hazards and i think we have to go back to what happened in the post-war era post-world 
 war ii when the nuclear scientists who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers and they were inspired not by the young einstein who did the great work in relativity 
 but by the old einstein the icon of poster and t-shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws he was premature but he was a moral compass an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i 
 'm privileged to know joe rothblatt equally untidy office there as you can see he 's 96 years old and he founded the pugwash movement he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell and he sets an example of the concerned scientist 
 and i think to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed we need latter-day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt we need not just campaigning physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well and i think academics and independent 
 entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure i wrote my book our final century as a scientist just a general scientist but there 's one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered 
 a special perspective and that 's that it offers an awareness of the immense future the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture outside the american bible belt anyway but most people even those who are familiar with evolution are n't mindful that 
 even more time lies ahead the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years but it 'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out on that schematic picture a sort of time-lapse picture we 're halfway and it 'll be another six billion 
 before that happens and any remaining life on earth is vaporized there 's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the sun 's demise but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria the 
 unfolding of intelligence and complexity still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity in our earth and beyond if you represent the earth 's lifetime by a single year say from january when 
 it was made to december the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in june a tiny fraction of the year but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very special the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet as i should 
 have shown this earlier it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria when einstein died in 1955 one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the 
 washington post the plaque reads albert einstein lived here and i'd like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image we've been familiar for 40 years with this image the fragile beauty of land ocean and clouds contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the 
 astronauts left their footprints but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos from afar not just for 40 years but for the entire 45 billion-year history of our earth what would they have seen over nearly all that immense time 
 earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually the only abrupt worldwide change would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions apart from those brief traumas nothing happens suddenly the continental landmasses drifted around ice cover waxed and waned successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct 
 but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history the last one-millionth part a few thousand years the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before this signaled the start of agriculture change has accelerated as human populations rose then other things happened even more abruptly within 
 just 50 years that 's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise and ominously fast the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves the total output from all tv and cell phones and radar transmissions 
 and something else happened metallic objects albeit very small ones a few tons at most escaped into orbit around the earth some journeyed to the moons and planets a race of advanced extraterrestrials watching our solar system from afar could confidently predict earth 's final doom in another six 
 billion years but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than halfway through the earth 's life these human-induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed if they continued their vigil what might these hypothetical aliens witness in 
 the next hundred years will some spasm foreclose earth 's future or will the biosphere stabilize or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases a post-human life elsewhere the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization 
 but for civilization to survive we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein humane global and farseeing and whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth as depicted here thank you very much 
 good afternoon there 's a medical revolution happening all around us and it 's one that 's going to help us conquer some of society 's most dreaded conditions including cancer the revolution is called angiogenesis and it 's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood 
 vessels so why should we care about blood vessels well the human body is literally packed with them 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult end to end that would form a line that would circle the earth twice the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we've got 19 
 billion of them in our bodies and these are the vessels of life and as i 'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in 
 for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive 
 we get most of these blood vessels when we 're actually still in the womb and what that means is that as adults blood vessels do n't normally grow except in a few special circumstances: in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus 
 during pregnancy they form the placenta which connects mom and baby and after injury blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing toward the center of the wound 
 so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis such that when we need a brief burst of blood vessels 
 the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout and when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis now there are other 
 situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels -- for example after an injury -- and a body can do that too but only to that normal level that set point but what we now 
 know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system where the body cannot prune back extra blood vessels or cannot grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time and in these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis 
 is out of balance a myriad of diseases result for example insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels leads to wounds that do n't heal heart attacks legs without circulation death from stroke nerve damage and on the other end excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and 
 we see this in cancer blindness arthritis obesity alzheimer 's disease in total there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator 
 and this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis now i 'm going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer every type of cancer so here we go this is a tumor dark gray ominous 
 mass growing inside a brain and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients but cancers do n't start out like this and in fact cancers do n't start out with a blood supply 
 they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that 's the tip of a ballpoint pen then they cannot get any larger because they do n't have a blood supply so they do n't have enough oxygen 
 or nutrients in fact we 're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts 
 about 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers and virtually 100 percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid yet without a blood supply most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr. 
 judah folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease so the body 's ability to balance angiogenesis when it 's working properly prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers and this turns out to be one of our most 
 important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply cannot grow up but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly cancer 
 cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer it can expand it can invade local tissues and the same vessels that are feeding 
 tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it 's most likely to be diagnosed when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so if angiogenesis is a tipping 
 point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply we call this antiangiogenic therapy and it 's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood 
 vessels that are feeding the cancers and we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body: they 're abnormal they 're very poorly constructed and because of that they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them 
 in effect when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy here an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved here 's a woman with a breast cancer being treated 
 with the antiangiogenic drug called avastin which is fda approved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment well i've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy so a few years ago i asked myself 
 can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so here is a nine year-old boxer named milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder it invaded into his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months 
 to live so we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an antiangiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor and within a few weeks of treatment we were able to slow down that cancer 
 's growth such that we were ultimately able to extend milo 's survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with a very good quality of life and we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs we have about a 60 percent response rate and improved survival 
 for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples this is 20-year-old dolphin living in florida and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers 
 so we created an antiangiogenic paste we had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week and over the course of seven months the cancers completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here 's a cancer growing on the lip of a wuarter horse 
 named guinness it 's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma it had already spread to his lymph nodes so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside 
 and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission and here he is six years later guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers and in fact the first pioneering treatments for people as well as 
 dogs are already becoming available there 's 12 different drugs 11 different cancer types but the real question is how well do these work in practice so here 's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer the bars represent survival time taken from the era 
 in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery or radiation available but starting in 2004 when antiangiogenic therapies first became available well you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer multiple myeloma colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal 
 tumors that 's impressive but for other tumors and cancer types the improvements have only been modest so i started asking myself why have n't we been able to do better and the answer to me is obvious we 're treating cancer too late in the game when 
 it 's already established and oftentimes it 's already spread or metastasized and as a doctor i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so i went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking could 
 the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous this could help healthy people as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so 
 to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer i went back to look at cancer 's causes and what really intrigued me was when i saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers now the obvious thing is to think about what we 
 could remove from our diet what to strip out take away but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking what could we be adding to our diet that 's naturally antiangiogenic that could boost the body 's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that 
 are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer well the answer 's yes and i 'm going to show you how our search for this has taken us to the market the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we've discovered is that mother 
 nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis so here 's a test system we developed at the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion and we can use 
 this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating so let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes the active ingredient 's resveratrol it 's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent 
 here 's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries it potently inhibits angiogenesis and extract from soybeans and here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we 're interested in studying for each food type we believe that there are different potencies within different 
 strains and varietals and we want to measure this because well while you 're eating a strawberry or drinking tea why not select the one that 's most potent for preventing cancer so here are four different teas that we've tested they 're all common ones chinese jasmine 
 japanese sencha earl grey and a special blend that we prepared and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent but what 's very cool is when we actually combined the two less potent teas together the combination the blend 
 is more potent than either one alone this means there 's food synergy here 's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar and using this system we can test the potency of cancer drugs so 
 the shorter the bar less angiogenesis that 's good and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people statins nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others they inhibit angiogenesis too and here are the dietary factors going head to head against 
 these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own and in some cases they 're more potent than the actual drugs soy parsley garlic grapes berries i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients so imagine if we could create the world 's first 
 rating system in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic cancer-preventative properties and that 's what we 're doing right now now i've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can 
 reduce angiogenesis in cancer well the best example i know is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing 
 prostate cancer now we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene and lycopene is antiangiogenic but what 's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels 
 feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with dean ornish at ucsf and tufts university on the role 
 of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream now obviously what i've shared with you has some far-ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we 're right it could impact on consumer education food services public health and even the insurance 
 industry and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines check out this ad from blue cross blue shield of minnesota and for many people around the world dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage 
 cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable antiangiogenic crops now finally i've talked to you about food and i've talked to you about cancer so there 's just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that 's obesity 
 because it turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly angiogenesis dependent and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply so the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse 
 that eats nonstop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor it loses weight stop the treatment gains the weight back restart the treatment 
 loses the weight again stop the treatment it gains the weight back and in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis so this approach that we 're taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity the really truly interesting thing about 
 this is that we cannot take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse 's weight is supposed to be in other words we cannot create supermodel mice and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points albert 
 szent-gyorgi once said that discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen and thinking what no one has thought i hope i've convinced you that for diseases like cancer obesity and other conditions that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that 's what 
 i think the world needs now thank you june cohen i have a quick question for you so these drugs are n't exactly they 're not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now for anyone out here who has cancer what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these 
 treatments now for most cancer patients william li so there are antiangiogenic treatments that are fda approved and if you 're a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one you should ask about them and there are many clinical trials the angiogenesis foundation is following almost 
 300 companies and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline so consider the approved ones look for clinical trials but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves and this is one of the themes 
 that i 'm talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors cannot do for us which is to use knowledge and take action and if mother nature has given us some clues we think that there might be a new future in the value 
 of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day jc right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of 
 tomato sauce wl well you know there 's abundant epidemiological evidence and i think in the information age it does n't take long to go to a credible source like pubmed the national library of medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and 
 based on common medications and that 's certainly something that anybody can look into jc okay well thank you so much so for any of us in this room today let 's start out by admitting we 're lucky we do n't live in the world our mothers lived 
 in our grandmothers lived in where career choices for women were so limited and if you 're in this room today most of us grew up in a world where we had basic civil rights and amazingly we still live in a world where some women do n't have 
 them but all that aside we still have a problem and it 's a real problem and the problem is this women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world the numbers tell the story quite clearly 190 heads of state nine 
 are women of all the people in parliament in the world 13 percent are women in the corporate sector women at the top c-level jobs board seats tops out at 15 16 percent the numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction and even in 
 the non-profit world a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women women at the top 20 percent we also have another problem which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment a recent study in the us showed that of 
 married senior managers two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children a couple of years ago i was in new york and i was pitching a deal and i was in one of those fancy new york private equity offices you can 
 picture and i 'm in the meeting it 's about a three-hour meeting and two hours in there kind of needs to be that bio break and everyone stands up and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed and i realized he does n't know where the 
 women 's room is in his office so i start looking around for moving boxes figuring they just moved in but i do n't see any and so i said did you just move into this office and he said no we've been here about a year and 
 i said are you telling me that i am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year and he looked at me and he said yeah or maybe you 're the only one who had to go to the bathroom so the question is 
 how are we going to fix this how do we change these numbers at the top how do we make this different i want to start out by saying i talk about this about keeping women in the workforce because i really think that 's the answer in 
 the high-income part of our workforce in the people who end up at the top fortune 500 ceo jobs or the equivalent in other industries the problem i am convinced is that women are dropping out now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime 
 and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women i want to talk about none of that today even though that 's all really important today i want to focus on what we can do as individuals what are the messages we need to tell ourselves what 
 are the messages we tell the women who work with and for us what are the messages we tell our daughters now at the outset i want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments i do n't have the right answer i do n't even have 
 it for myself i left san francisco where i live on monday and i was getting on the plane for this conference and my daughter who 's three when i dropped her off at preschool did that whole hugging-the-leg crying mommy do n't get on the plane thing 
 this is hard i feel guilty sometimes i know no women whether they 're at home or whether they 're in the workforce who do n't feel that sometimes so i 'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone my talk today is about 
 what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce and i think there are three one sit at the table two make your partner a real partner and three do n't leave before you leave number one sit at the table just a couple weeks 
 ago at facebook we hosted a very senior government official and he came in to meet with senior execs from around silicon valley and everyone kind of sat at the table and then he had these two women who were traveling with him who were pretty senior in his 
 department and i kind of said to them sit at the table come on sit at the table and they sat on the side of the room when i was in college my senior year i took a course called european intellectual history do n't you love that kind 
 of thing from college i wish i could do that now and i took it with my roommate carrie who was then a brilliant literary student and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar and my brother smart guy but a water-polo-playing pre-med who was a sophomore 
 the three of us take this class together and then carrie reads all the books in the original greek and latin goes to all the lectures i read all the books in english and go to most of the lectures my brother is kind of busy he reads one book 
 of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored the three of us go to the exam together and we sit down and we sit there for three hours and our little blue 
 notebooks yes i 'm that old and we walk out and we look at each other and we say how did you do and carrie says boy i feel like i did n't really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic and i say god i 
 really wish i had really connected john locke 's theory of property with the philosophers who follow and my brother says i got the top grade in the class you got the top grade in the class you do n't know anything the problem with these stories is that they 
 show what the data shows women systematically underestimate their own abilities if you test men and women and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like gpas men get it wrong slightly high and women get it wrong slightly low women do not negotiate for themselves in the 
 workforce a study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering or men i guess are negotiating their first salary and only seven percent of women and most importantly men attribute their success to themselves and 
 women attribute it to other external factors if you ask men why they did a good job they 'll say i 'm awesome obviously why are you even asking if you ask women why they did a good job what they 'll say is someone helped them they got lucky 
 they worked really hard why does this matter boy it matters a lot because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side not at the table and no one gets the promotion if they do n't think they deserve their success or they do n't 
 even understand their own success i wish the answer were easy i wish i could just go tell all the young women i work for all these fabulous women believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself own your own success i wish i could tell that to my daughter 
 but it 's not that simple because what the data shows above all else is one thing which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women and everyone 's nodding because we all know this to be true there 's a really 
 good study that shows this really well there 's a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen and she 's an operator in a company in silicon valley and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist in 2002 not so long 
 ago a professor who was then at columbia university took that case and made it howard roizen and he gave the case out both of them to two groups of students he changed exactly one word heidi to howard but that one word made a really big difference 
 he then surveyed the students and the good news was the students both men and women thought heidi and howard were equally competent and that 's good the bad news was that everyone liked howard he 's a great guy you want to work for him you want to spend 
 the day fishing with him but heidi not so sure she 's a little out for herself she 's a little political you 're not sure you'd want to work for her this is the complication we have to tell our daughters and our colleagues we have to tell 
 ourselves to believe we got the a to reach for the promotion to sit at the table and we have to do it in a world where for them there are sacrifices they will make for that even though for their brothers there are not the saddest thing about 
 all of this is that it 's really hard to remember this and i 'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me but i think important i gave this talk at facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees and a couple hours later 
 there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk and she wanted to talk to me i said okay and she sat down and we talked and she said i learned something today i learned that i need to keep my hand up i 
 said what do you mean she said well you 're giving this talk and you said you were going to take two more questions and i had my hand up with lots of other people and you took two more questions and i put my hand down and i noticed 
 all the women put their hand down and then you took more questions only from the men and i thought to myself wow if it 's me who cares about this obviously giving this talk and during this talk i cannot even notice that the men 's hands are 
 still raised and the women 's hands are still raised how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women we've got to get women to sit at the table message number two make 
 your partner a real partner i've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home the data shows this very clearly if a woman and a man work full-time and have a child the woman does twice the amount of housework the man 
 does and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does so she 's got three jobs or two jobs and he 's got one who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more the causes of this are really complicated 
 and i do n't have time to go into them and i do n't think sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause i think the cause is more complicated i think as a society we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls 
 i know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers and it 's hard when i go to the mommy-and-me stuff and i see the father there i notice that the other mommies do n't play with him and that 's a problem 
 because we have to make it as important a job because it 's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home for people of both genders if we 're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce studies show that households with 
 equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate and if that was n't good enough motivation for everyone out there they also have more how shall i say this on this stage they know each other more in the biblical sense as well message number three 
 do n't leave before you leave i think there 's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking and i see this all the time with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving here 's what happens we 
 're all busy everyone 's busy a woman 's busy and she starts thinking about having a child and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child she starts thinking about making room for that child how am i going to fit this into everything else i 'm 
 doing and literally from that moment she does n't raise her hand anymore she does n't look for a promotion she does n't take on the new project she does n't say me i want to do that she starts leaning back the problem is that let 's say 
 she got pregnant that day that day nine months of pregnancy three months of maternity leave six months to catch your breath fast-forward two years more often and as i've seen it women start thinking about this way earlier when they get engaged when they get married when 
 they start thinking about trying to have a child which can take a long time one woman came to see me about this and i kind of looked at her she looked a little young and i said so are you and your husband thinking about having a baby 
 and she said oh no i 'm not married she did n't even have a boyfriend i said you 're thinking about this just way too early but the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back everyone who 's been through this and 
 i 'm here to tell you once you have a child at home your job better be really good to go back because it 's hard to leave that kid at home your job needs to be challenging it needs to be rewarding you need to feel like you 're 
 making a difference and if two years ago you did n't take a promotion and some guy next to you did if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities you 're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal 
 do n't leave before you leave stay in keep your foot on the gas pedal until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child and then make your decisions do n't make decisions too far in advance particularly ones you 're not even conscious 
 you 're making my generation really sadly is not going to change the numbers at the top they 're just not moving we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population in my generation there will not be 50 percent of women at the top 
 of any industry but i 'm hopeful that future generations can i think a world that was run where half of our countries and half of our companies were run by women would be a better world and it 's not just because people would know where the women 
 's bathrooms are even though that would be very helpful i think it would be a better world i have two children i have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter i want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home 
 and i want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed but to be liked for her accomplishments thank you /transcript well good morning you know the computer and television both recently turned 60 and today i'd like to talk about their relationship despite their middle age 
 if you've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that 
 lead to the writers strike and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter to get a sense of this and it 's been a theme we've talked about all week i recently talked 
 to a bunch of tweeners i wrote on cards television radio myspace internet pc and i said just arrange these from what 's important to you and what 's not and then tell me why let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the 
 discussion on television girl 1 well i think it 's important but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs peter hirshberg which is more fun internet or tv girls internet girl 2 i think we the 
 reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer girl 2 and then you can download onto your ipod ph would you like to be the president of a tv network girl 4 i would n't like it 
 girl 2 that would be so stressful girl 5 no ph how come girl 5 because they 're going to lose all their money eventually girl 3 like the stock market it goes up and down and stuff i think right now the computers will be at the top 
 and everything will be kind of going down and stuff ph there 's been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about 30 we go through periods of enthrallment followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best 
 characterized as what 's the finance term ick pooey let me give you an example of this the year is 1976 and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system 
 and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures citicorp penney rca all getting into this big vision by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm going 
 to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i 'm all i 'm at warner that summer i 'm all excited to work on convergence and then the bottom falls out does n't work out too well for them they lose money and i had a happy 
 brush with convergence until kind of warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school and i cannot work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california where the remaining jobs are almost 
 to the sea to go to work for apple computer warner of course writes off more than 400 million dollars four hundred million dollars which was real money back in the 70s but they were onto something and they got better at it by the year 2000 the process was 
 perfected they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet now i think that one reason that the media and 
 the entertainment communities or the media community is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know for 50 years we've talked about changing the world about total transformation for 50 years it 's been about hopes and fears and promises of a 
 better world and i got to thinking you know who else talks that way and the answer is pretty clearly it 's people in religion and in politics and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic 
 movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world it does n't work out too well and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and la look on in absolute 
 morbid astonishment but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing so what i'd like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was 
 built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems but things got really interesting just a couple of years later 1949 with whirlwind built at mit 's lincoln lab jay forrester was building this 
 for the navy but you cannot help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers 
 and the computer begins to express itself journalist it 's a whirlwind electronic computer with considerable trepidation we undertake to interview this new machine jay forrester hello new york this is cambridge and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer would you like if i used the 
 machine journalist yes of course but i have an idea mr. forrester since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why do n't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy 's research chief admiral bolster give whirlwind the workout 
 calvin bolster well ed this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket this rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky now at the standard rate of fuel consumption i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine 
 at any instant say at the end of 40 seconds the amount of fuel remaining and the velocity at that set instant jf over on the left-hand side you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off and on the right-hand side there 's a scale that 
 shows the rocket 's velocity the rocket 's position is shown by the trajectory that we 're now looking at and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory the velocity you will notice has dropped off to a minimum then as the rocket dives down velocity picks up 
 again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground how 's that journalist what about that admiral cb looks very good to me jf and before leaving we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in 
 their spare time in a less serious vein for a sunday afternoon journalist thank you very much indeed mr. forrester and the mit lab ph you know so much was worked out the first real-time interaction the video display pointing a gun it lead to the microcomputer but 
 unfortunately it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if it were n't for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it 
 needs the biggest computer ever to protect us they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a-bomb in the first place 
 talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video narrator in a mass raid high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks and then it 
 would be too late to act we cannot afford to take that chance it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage the semi-automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses this new computer built to become the nerve center of a defense 
 network is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel-driven generators air-conditioning equipment and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer ph you know that 
 one computer was huge there 's an interesting marketing lesson from it which is basically when you market a product you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you or there 's one other marketing proposition if you do n't 
 use our product you 'll die this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and modems so all these things could talk to each other about 20 percent of all the nation 's programmers 
 were wrapped up in this thing and it led to an awful lot of what we have today it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this because we've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things 
 small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in there 
 but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core 2 extreme which is a four-core processor that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow to build that what we'd do with whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the 
 10 to mulholland and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds and then the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france 
 creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something clearly they 're not so and we have n't even worked out the cooling needs but it gives you the kind of power that people have that the audience has and the reasons these transformations are 
 happening all of this stuff starts moving into industry dec kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer it shows up at places like mit and then a mutation happens spacewar is built the first computer game and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and passion 
 is worked out actually many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out dec knew a good thing about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game meanwhile as all of 
 this is happening by the mid-'50s the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air 
 and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i've been reading all week rca had david sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this i do n't say that radio networks must die every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern 
 new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio but i do n't know how and of course as the computer industry develops interactively producers in the emerging tv business actually hit 
 on the same idea and they fake it jack berry boys and girls i think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set you just get them out first of all get your winky dink kits out put out your magic window and your 
 erasing glove and rub it like this that 's the way we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set and rub it out from the center to the corners 
 like this make sure you keep your magic crayons handy your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that you all set ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the 
 secret lab ph it was the dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying pete i could use any ordinary open-source crayon why do i have to 
 buy theirs i assure you that 's not the case turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window this proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on 
 to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere it led to lawsuits federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that 's a scandal we wo n't discuss today but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the 
 host of winky dink went on to become the host of twenty one one of the most important quiz shows ever and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak ending berry 's career and actually ending 
 the career of a lot of people at cbs it turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked and 50 years ago if you'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media there was one prophet and only but 
 one you wanted to hear from professor marshall mcluhan he actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the 1960s marshall mcluhan if the audience can 
 become involved in the actual process of making the ad then it 's happy it 's like the old quiz shows they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do they were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time 
 because the shows were rigged now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers ph you know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word blogosphere of the internet today it is very true that his understanding is probably very 
 enlightening now let 's listen in to him mm the global village is a world in which you do n't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business and much involvement in everybody else 's life it 's a sort of ann landers column writ 
 large and it does n't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else 's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a village post office ph we 'll talk a little bit 
 more about him later we 're now right into the 1960s it 's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in 
 and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do but for this part of the story i'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff john markoff 
 do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs sex rock n roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing everything it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university between 1960 and 1975 in the midst of revolution in the streets 
 and rock and roll concerts in the parks a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri changed the world engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture but 
 while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula there was lsd leaking out of kesey 's veterans hospital experiments and other areas around the campus and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza 
 parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that interaction that led to 
 personal computing they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information i think these ideas are difficult to 
 understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title of the book is what the dormouse said how 
 the 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song the lyrics go remember what the dormouse said feed your head feed your head feed your head ph by this time computing had kind of leapt into media territory 
 and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley here 's the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab in 1981 meanwhile in california we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program 
 to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a scripted language 
 heck it was everything so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant a few years later we then hit on the idea of explaining 
 to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it and the easy way here 's the apple marketing video james burke you 'll be pleased to know i 'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive 
 video the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks by far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier the method we illustrate in this video uses a 
 pre-made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests ph i hope you realize how subversive that is that 's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy 
 but he 's just declared war on the content business find the commercial stuff mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and the file system that 's fine but 
 as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people by the way speaking of the filing system it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network a few years later tim berners-lee worked 
 that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web now not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet but a couple of years later i helped bill gates do the same thing the year is 
 1993 and he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like 
 we predicted a lot of the right things but we also missed an awful lot let 's take a look narrator the pyramids the colosseum the new york subway system and tv dinners ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all yet each pales to insignificance with the 
 completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology the digital superhighway once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians the digital highway arrived in america 's living rooms late in the twentieth century let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible 
 the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell though some were incredulous man 1 the phone company narrator stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising david sarnoff commercializes radio man 2 never had scientists been put under 
 such pressure and demand narrator the medium introduced america to new products voice 1 say mom windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work narrator in 1939 the radio corporation 
 of america introduced television man 2 never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand narrator eventually the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry and the re-regulation 
 of the cable television industry ted turner we did the work to build this this cable industry now the broadcasters want some of our money i mean it 's ridiculous narrator computers once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas 
 the world and all its culture reduced to bits the lingua franca of all media and the forces of convergence exploded finally four great industrial sectors combined telecommunications entertainment computing and everything else man 3 we 'll see channels for the gourmet and we 'll see channels for the 
 pet lover voice 2 next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer narrator all of industry was in play as investors flocked to place their bets at stake the battle for you the consumer and the right to spend billions to send a lot of 
 information into the parlors of america ph we missed a lot you know you missed we missed the internet the long tail the role of the audience open systems social networks it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media 
 thomas edison had the same problem he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea well you know where we 're going on from here 
 we come into the era of the dotcom the world wide web and i do n't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together but when we emerge from this and what we call web 20 things actually are quite different and 
 i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged if internet one was about pages now it 's about people it 's a customer it 's an audience it 's a person who 's participating it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now mm because 
 it gave the audience a role something to do ph in my own company technorati we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in that 's about 2,700 fresh connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there and it 's no wonder that as we 
 head into the writers strike odd things happen you know it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood that a producer is anyone who knows a writer i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem but it 's not a joke this 
 is a real headline websites attract striking writers: operators of sites like mydamnchannelcom could benefit from labor disputes meanwhile you have the tv bloggers going out on strike in sympathy with the television writers and then you have tv guide a fox property which is about to sponsor the online 
 video awards but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television not appearing to gloat to show you how schizophrenic this all is here 's the head of myspace or fox interactive a news corp company being asked well with the writers strike is n't this going to hurt 
 news corp and help you online man but i yeah i think there 's an opportunity as the strike continues there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv ph oh but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch man yes 
 well first you know i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group obviously we hope that the strike is that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible ph one of the great things that 's going on here is the globalization of content really is 
 happening here is a clip from a video from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in hollywood animation worked out in israel farmed out to croatia and india and it 's now an international series narrator the following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 
 pm and 2:18 pm in the months preceding the presidential primaries voice 1 you 'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over voice 2 you mean we 'll have to live here together voice 2 well there goes the 
 neighborhood ph the company that created this aniboom is an interesting example of where this is headed traditional tv animation costs say between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute they 're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute and they 're offering their creators 30 percent 
 of the back end in a much more entrepreneurial manner so it 's a different model what the entertainment business is struggling with the world of brands is figuring out for example nike now understands that nike plus is not just a device in its shoe it 's a 
 network to hook its customers together and the head of marketing at nike says people are coming to our site an average of three times a week we do n't have to go to them which means television advertising is down 57 percent for nike or as nike 's 
 head of marketing says we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive we 're in the business of connecting with consumers and media companies realize the audience is important also here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered 100 percent by 
 the user experience on the home page user-generated content married up with traditional content it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them or as geoffrey moore once told me it 's intellectual curiosity that 's the trade that brands need 
 in the age of the blogosphere and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business one of my heroes is songwriter ally willis who just wrote the color purple and has been an r and rhythm and blues writer and this is what she said about 
 where songwriting 's going ally willis where millions of collaborators wanted the song because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about ph so to wrap up i'd love to throw it back to marshall mcluhan who 40 years ago was dealing with 
 audiences that were going through just as much change and i think that today traditional hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before but i do n't need to tell you this let 's throw it back to him 
 narrator we are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new mm the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this they do n't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up they think of the old medium 
 because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv and as books used to be the content novels used to be the content of movies and so every time a new medium arrives the old medium is 
 the content and it is highly observable highly noticeable but the real real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium and it is ignored ph i think it 's a great time of enthrallment there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out 
 there content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth and part of social communications and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity and whereas television may have gotten beat up what 's getting built is a really 
 exciting new form of communication and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it thanks very much i want to talk about penguins today but first i want to start by saying that we need a new 
 operating system for the oceans and for the earth when i came to the galapagos 40 years ago there were 3,000 people that lived in the galapagos now there are over 30,000 there were two jeeps on santa cruz now there are around a thousand trucks and buses and 
 cars there so the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people it 's the same problems in the galapagos except obviously it 's worse here in some ways than other places because we've only doubled the population of the earth since the 1960s a 
 little more than doubled -- but we have 67 billion people in the world and we all like to consume and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback we 're not paying the true environmental costs of our 
 actions and when i came at age 22 to live on fernandina let me just say that i had never camped before i had never lived alone for any period of time and i'd never slept with sea lions snoring next to me all night but moreover i'd 
 never lived on an uninhabited island punta espinosa is where i lived for over a year and we call it uninhabited because there are no people there but it 's alive with life it 's hardly uninhabited so a lot has happened in the last 40 years and what i 
 learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of wild places wild things certainly wildlife and the amazing qualities that penguins have penguins are real athletes: they can swim 173 kilometers in a day they can swim at the same speed day and night -- that 
 's faster than any olympic swimmer i mean they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it but what is really amazing because of this deepness here emperor penguins can go down more than 500 meters and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes magellanic penguins 
 the ones that i work on they can dive to about 90 meters and they can stay down for about 46 minutes humans without fins 90 meters 35 minutes and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for 35 minutes you have to train to be 
 able to do that so penguins are amazing athletes the other thing is i've never met anybody that really does n't say that they like penguins they 're comical they walk upright and of course they 're diligent and more importantly they 're well-dressed so they have all the 
 criteria that people normally like but scientifically they 're amazing because they 're sentinels they tell us about our world in a lot of different ways and particularly the ocean this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that 's on the front of a little zodiac here in 
 the galapagos and that 's what i came to study i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins but you already know penguins are rare these are the rarest penguins in the world why i thought i was going to be able to do 
 that i do n't know but the population has changed dramatically since i was first here when i counted penguins for the first time and tried to do a census we just counted all the individual beaks that we could around all these islands we counted around 2,000 
 so i do n't know how many penguins there really are but i know i can count 2,000 if you go and do it now the national parks count about 500 so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did 40 years ago and this is true of 
 most of our living systems we have less than we had before and most of them are in fairly steep decline and i want to just show you a little bit about why that 's a penguin braying to tell you that it 's important to pay attention to 
 penguins most important of all i did n't know what that was the first time i heard it and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome plaintful call i fell in love with penguins and it certainly has changed the rest 
 of my life what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes the most extreme variation you've heard about these el ninos but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to this is a cold-water event 
 called la nina where it 's blue and it 's green it means the water is really cold and so you can see this current coming up in this case the humboldt current that comes all the way out to the galapagos islands and this deep undersea current 
 the cromwell current that upwells around the galapagos that brings all the nutrients: when this is cold in the galapagos it 's rich and there 's plenty of food for everyone when we have extreme el nino events you see all this red and you see no green out here 
 around the galapagos that means that there 's no upwelling and there 's basically no food so it 's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas things die when there 's no food but we did n't even know 
 that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins and you can imagine being on an island hoping you 're going to see penguins and you 're in the middle of an el nino event and there are no penguins they 're not breeding they 're not 
 even around i studied marine iguanas at that point but this is a global phenomenon we know that and if you look along the coast of argentina where i work now at a place called punta tombo the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 
 degrees south latitude you see that there 's great variation here some years the cold water goes all the way up to brazil and other years in these la nina years it does n't so the oceans do n't always act together they act differently but that is the 
 kind of variation that penguins have to live with and it 's not easy so when i went to study the magellanic penguins i did n't have any problems there were plenty of them this is a picture at punta tombo in february showing all the penguins along the 
 beach i went there because the japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves protein and oil fortunately nobody has harvested any penguins and we 're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them but the population is declining and it 's 
 declined fairly substantially about 21 percent since 1987 when i started these surveys in terms of number of active nests here you can see where punta tombo is and they breed in incredibly dense colonies we know this because of long-term science because we have long-term studies there 
 and science is important in informing decision makers and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in and so we have this penguin project the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 
 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps and also we know that it 's not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble but magellanics and many other species of penguins and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real 
 plight of penguins this is one of the plights of penguins oil pollution penguins do n't like oil and they do n't like to swim through oil the nice thing is if you look down here in argentina there 's no surface oil pollution from this composite map 
 but in fact when we went to argentina penguins were often found totally covered in oil so they were just minding their own business they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point 
 so when they 're empty they have the ballast water in there when they come back they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean why do they do that because it 's cheaper because they do n't pay the real environmental costs we usually do n't and 
 we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost at first the argentine government said no there 's no way you cannot find oiled penguins in argentina we have laws and we cannot have illegal dumping it 's against the law so 
 we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins in some years like this year we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil these little blue dots are the fledglings we do this 
 survey every march which means that they 're only in the environment from january until march so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil and you can see in some years over 60 percent of the fledglings were oiled eventually the government listened 
 and amazingly they changed their laws they moved the tanker lanes 40 kilometers farther off shore and people are not doing as much illegal dumping so what we 're seeing now is very few penguins are oiled why are there even these penguins oiled because we've solved the problem 
 in chubut province which is like a state in argentina where punta tombo is so that 's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline but we have n't solved the problem in northern argentina uruguay and brazil so now i want to show you that penguins are affected i 'm just 
 going to talk about two things this is climate change now this has really been a fun study because i put satellite tags on the back of these magellanic penguins try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back 
 of penguins but we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go we thought we needed a marine protected area of about 30 kilometers and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin and what the penguins show us 
 and these are all the little dots from where the penguins positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 -- and what you see is some of these individuals are going 800 kilometers away from their nests so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating 
 the eggs the other one is out there foraging and the longer they have to stay gone the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back and of course all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you cannot raise a lot of chicks 
 here you see in 2003 these are all the dots of where the penguins are they were raising a little over a half of a chick here you can see in 2006 they raised almost three quarters of a chick per nest and you can see that they 're 
 closer to punta tombo they 're not going as far away this past year in 2009 you can see that they 're now raising about a fourth of a chick and some of these individuals are going more than 900 kilometers away from their nests so it 's kind 
 of like you having a job in chicago and then you get transferred to st louis and your mate is not happy about this because you've got to pay airfare because you 're gone longer the same thing 's true for penguins as well and they 're going about 
 on average now 40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago we need to be able to get information out to the general public and so we started a publication with the society for conservation that we think presents cutting-edge science in a new novel way because 
 we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the general public so if you 're interested in cutting-edge science and smarter conservation you should join with our 11 partners some of them here in this room like the nature conservancy 
 and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public lastly i want to say that all of you probably have had some relationship at some time in your life with a dog a cat some sort of pet and 
 you recognized that those are individuals and some of you consider them almost part of your family if you had a relationship with a penguin you'd see it in the same sort of way they 're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they 're not 
 that different from us: they 're trying to make a living they 're trying to raise their offspring they 're trying to get on and survive in the world this is turbo the penguin turbo 's never been fed he met us and got his name because he started 
 standing under my diesel truck a turbo truck so we named him turbo turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak we let him in and he comes in here and i just wanted to show you what happened one day when turbo brought in a 
 friend so this is turbo he 's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting which he would do to a female penguin and you can see he 's not trying to bite this guy has never been in before and he 's trying to figure 
 out what is going on what is this guy doing this is really pretty weird and you 'll see soon that my graduate student and you see turbo 's pretty intent on his flipper patting and now he 's looking at the other guy saying you are really weird 
 and now look at this not friendly so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats we 're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate so we 're trying to put that in computers in the field and penguins are 
 always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another this is a radio frequency id system you put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode so it tells you who it is it walks over the 
 pad and you know who it is okay so here are a few penguins coming in see this one 's coming back to its nest they 're all coming in at this time walking across there just kind of leisurely coming in here 's a female that 's in 
 a hurry she 's got food she 's really rushing back because it 's hot to try to feed her chicks and then there 's another fellow that will leisurely come by look how fat he is he 's walking back to feed his chicks then i realize that 
 they 're playing king of the box this is my box up here and this is the system that works you can see this penguin he goes over he looks at those wires does not like that wire he unplugs the wire we have no data so they 
 really are pretty amazing creatures ok most important thing is only you can change yourself and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins let me share with you today an original discovery but i want to tell it to you the 
 way it really happened -- not the way i present it in a scientific meeting or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper it 's a story about beyond biomimetics to something i 'm calling biomutualism i define that as an association between biology and another discipline 
 where each discipline reciprocally advances the other but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field now in terms of biomimetics as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature nature becomes a much more useful teacher engineering can be inspired by biology by 
 using its principles and analogies when they 're advantageous but then integrating that with the best human engineering ultimately to make something actually better than nature now being a biologist i was very curious about this these are gecko toes and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes 
 to climb up a wall so quickly we discovered it and what we found was that they have leaf-like structures on their toes with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible about 100 to 1000 
 split ends that are nano-size and the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends they do n't stick by velcro or suction or glue they actually stick by intermolecular forces alone van der waals forces and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the 
 first synthetic self-cleaning dry adhesive has been made from the simplest version in nature one branch my engineering collaborator ron fearing at berkeley had made the first synthetic version and so has my other incredible collaborator mark cutkosky at stanford -- he made much larger hairs than the gecko 
 but used the same general principles and here is its first test that 's kellar autumn my former phd student professor now at lewis and clark literally giving his first-born child up for this test more recently this happened man this the first time someone has actually climbed with 
 it narrator lynn verinsky a professional climber who appeared to be brimming with confidence lynn verinsky honestly it 's going to be perfectly safe it will be perfectly safe man how do you know lynn verinsky because of liability insurance narrator with a mattress below and attached to a 
 safety rope lynn began her 60-foot ascent lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood and science man so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko lynn verinsky ha wow and what a privilege that has been robert full that 
 's what she did on rough surfaces but she actually used these on smooth surfaces two of them to climb up and pull herself up and you can try this in the lobby and look at the gecko-inspired material now the problem with the robots doing this is that they 
 cannot get unstuck with the material this is the gecko 's solution they actually peel their toes away from the surface at high rates as they run up the wall well i 'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot stickybot using a new 
 hierarchical dry adhesive here is the actual robot and here is what it does and if you look you can see that it uses the toe peeling just like the gecko does if we can show some of the video you can see it climbing up the wall 
 there it is and now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot oh one thing i want to point out is look at stickybot you see something on it it 's not just 
 to look like a gecko it has a tail and just when you think you've figured out nature this kind of thing happens the engineers told us for the climbing robots that if they do n't have a tail they fall off the wall so what they did was 
 they asked us an important question they said well it kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there do animals use their tails when they climb up walls what they were doing was returning the favor by giving us a hypothesis to test 
 in biology that we would n't have thought of so of course in reality we were then panicked being the biologists and we should know this already we said well what do tails do well we know that tails store fat for example we know that you can grab 
 onto things with them and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static balance it can also act as a counterbalance so watch this kangaroo see that tail that 's incredible marc raibert built a uniroo hopping robot and it was unstable without its tail now 
 mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation by increasing the moment of inertia of a student so they had a tail and running them through and obstacle course and found a decrement in performance like you'd predict 
 but of course this is a passive tail and you can also have active tails and when i went back to research this i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past from nathan we've talked about an active tail video myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs were 
 interested in love not war robert full he talked about the tail being a whip for communication it can also be used in defense pretty powerful so we then went back and looked at the animal and we ran it up a surface but this time what we did 
 is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips this is slowed down 10 times so here is normal speed and watch it now slip and see what it does 
 with its tail it has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg and it contributes to stability if you make it slip a huge amount this is what we discovered this is incredible the engineers had a really good idea and then of course we wondered 
 okay they have an active tail but let 's picture them they 're climbing up a wall or a tree and they get to the top and let 's say there 's some leaves there and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and 
 there was some wind or we shook it and we did that experiment that you see here and this is what we discovered now that 's real time you cannot see anything but there it is slowed down what we discovered was the world 's fastest air-righting response for 
 those of you who remember your physics that 's a zero-angular-momentum righting response but it 's like a cat you know cats falling cats do this they twist their bodies but geckos do it better and they do it with their tail so they do it with this active tail 
 as they swing around and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture okay now we wondered if we were right we should be able to test this in a physical model in a robot so for ted we actually built a robot over there 
 a prototype with the tail and we 're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail with a robot if we could have the lights on it okay there it goes and show the video there it is and it works just like it does in the animal 
 so all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself now of course we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations so we thought oh that 's okay we 'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel we 'll blow the air up 
 we 'll give it a landing target a tree trunk just outside the plexi-glass enclosure and see what it does so we did and here is what it does so the wind is coming from the bottom this is slowed down 10 times it does an equilibrium glide 
 highly controlled this is sort of incredible but actually it 's quite beautiful when you take a picture of it and it 's better than that it just in the slide maneuvers in mid-air and the way it does it is it takes its tail and it swings it one 
 way to yaw left and it swings its other way to yaw right so we can maneuver this way and then we had to film this several times to believe this it also does this watch this it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin it 
 can actually swim through the air but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees and trying to control a glide stay tuned for that so then we 
 wondered can they actually maneuver with this so there is the landing target could they steer towards it with these capabilities here it is in the wind tunnel and it certainly looks like it you can see it even better from down on top watch the animal definitely 
 moving towards the landing target watch the whip of its tail as it does it look at that it 's unbelievable so now we were really confused because there are no reports of it gliding so we went oh my god we have to go to the field and 
 see if it actually does this completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film of course we wondered do they actually glide in nature well we went to the forests of singapore and southeast asia and the next video you see is the first time we've 
 showed this this is the actual video not staged a real research video of animal gliding down there is a red trajectory line look at the end to see the animal but then as it gets closer to the tree look at the close-up and see if you can 
 see it land so there it comes down there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line you see it there there watch it come down now watch up there and you can see the landing did you see it hit it actually uses its tail too 
 just like we saw in the lab so now we can continue this mutualism by suggesting that they can make an active tail and here is the first active tail in the robot made by boston dynamics so to conclude i think we need to build biomutualisms like 
 i showed that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application to do this though we need to redesign education in a major way to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication and explicitly train people how to contribute to and benefit from other disciplines and of course you need 
 the organisms and the environment to do it that is whether you care about security search and rescue or health we must preserve nature 's designs otherwise these secrets will be lost forever and from what i heard from our new president i 'm very optimistic thank you 
 amongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today we think of financial and economic primarily the ones that concern me most is the deficit of political dialogue our ability to address modern conflicts as they are to go to the source of what they 're all about and to 
 understand the key players and to deal with them we who are diplomats we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states and i can tell you our agenda is full there is trade there is disarmament there is cross-border relations but the picture is 
 changing and we are seeing that there are new key players coming onto the scene we loosely call them groups they may represent social religious political economic military realities and we struggle with how to deal with them the rules of engagement how to talk when to talk 
 and how to deal with them let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today you see the green is a traditional interstate conflict the ones we used to read about the red is modern conflict conflicts within states these are quite 
 different and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy and the core of these key actors are groups who represent different interests inside countries and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries so in a way it is everybody 's business another 
 acknowledgment we've seen during these years recent years is that very few of these domestic interstate intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily they may have to be dealt with with military means but they cannot be solved by military means they need political solutions and we therefore have a problem 
 because they escape traditional diplomacy and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them plus during the last decade we've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous after 9/11 either you were with us or against us it was black or 
 white and groups are very often immediately label terrorists and who would talk to terrorists the west as i would see it comes out of that decade weakened because we did n't understand the group so we've spent more time on focusing on why we should not talk to 
 others than finding out how we talk to others now i 'm not naive you cannot talk to everybody all the time and there are times you should walk and sometimes military intervention is necessary i happen to believe that libya was necessary and that military intervention in afghanistan 
 was also necessary and my country relies on its security through military alliance that 's clear but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict let us turn to afghanistan 10 years after that military intervention that country is far from secure the 
 situation to be honest is very serious now again the military is necessary but the military is no problem-solver when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister i met the commander of isaf the international troops and he told me that this can be won militarily 
 minister we just have to persevere now four com isaf 's later we hear a different message this cannot be won militarily we need military presence but we need to move to politics we can only solve this through a political solution and it is not us who will 
 solve it afghans have to solve it but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 2002 they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues everybody seems to agree with that 
 it was very controversial to say three four five years ago now everybody agrees but now as we prepare to talk we understand how little we know because we did n't talk we did n't grasp what was going on the international committee of the red cross the 
 icrc is talking to everyone and it is doing so because it is neutral and that 's one reason why that organization probably is the best informed key player to understand modern conflict because they talk my point is that you do n't have to be neutral to talk 
 and you do n't have to agree when you sit down with the other side and you can always walk but if you do n't talk you cannot engage the other side and the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree 
 prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process you do n't make peace with your friends you make peace with your enemies it 's hard but it is necessary let me go one step further this is tahrir square there 's a revolution going on the 
 arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter it will last for a long long time and who knows what it will be called in the end that 's not the point the point is that we are probably seeing for the first time in the history 
 of the arab world a revolution bottom-up people 's revolution social groups are taking to the streets and we find out in the west that we know very little about what 's happening because we never talk to the people in these countries most governments followed the dictate of 
 the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups because they were terrorists so now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution we find out how little we know right now the discussion goes should we talk to the muslim brotherhood 
 should we talk to hamas if we talk to them we may legitimize them i think that is wrong if you talk in the right way you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood as we should that they must 
 respect minority rights if we do n't accept majority rights because they may turn out to be a majority how can we escape having a double-standard if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time do n't want to deal with the groups that are 
 representative how will we ever be interlocutors now my diplomats are instructed to talk to all these groups but talking can be done in different ways we make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level and talking at the political level now talking can be accompanied with aid 
 or not with aid talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion there 's a big array of the ways of dealing with this so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come we 
 will further radicalization i believe we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel and if we cannot demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states there are some rewards on 
 the other side the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising and for one reason primarily and the reason is what happened in south africa 
 nelson mandela when mandela came out of prison after 27 years of captivity if he had told his people it 's time to take up the arms it 's time to fight he would have been followed and i think the international community would have said fair enough 
 it 's their right to fight now as you know mandela did n't do that in his memoirs long road to freedom he wrote that he survived during those years of captivity because he always decided to look upon his oppressor as also being a human being also being a 
 human being so he engaged a political process of dialogue not as a strategy of the weak but as a strategy of the strong and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked 
 now south african friends will know that was very painful so what can we learn from all of this dialogue is not easy not between individuals not between groups not between governments but it is very necessary if we 're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts if 
 we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up supported by technology which is available to all we diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations we have to connect with these profound changes and what is dialogue really 
 about when i enter into dialogue i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the 
 other side 's signals we need a lot more training on how to do that and a lot more practice on how that can take problem-solving forward we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk and sometimes you may need to fight 
 and i would n't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances sometimes you have to but that strategy seldom takes you very far the alternative is a strategy of engagement and principled dialogue and i believe we need to strengthen this approach in modern diplomacy not only between 
 states but also within states we are seeing some new signs we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently by engaging with civil society all of a sudden ngos were not only standing 
 in the streets crying their slogans but they were taking them into the negotiations partly because they represented the victims of these weapons and they brought their knowledge and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up this is perhaps a first element of a change 
 in the future i believe we should draw examples from these different illustrations not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times climate change how are we going to solve 
 climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and people not part of the problem but part of the solution it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new 
 rounds of difficult climate negotiations but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization it 's crucial to understand i believe because of technology and because of globalization societies from bottom-up we as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities 
 what is it that makes people trust each other not only between states but also within states what is the legitimacy of diplomacy of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they cannot be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very 
 loosely call groups the good thing is that we are not powerless we have never had as many means of communication means of being connected means of reaching out means of including the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication 
 but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it now i hope in the coming years that we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples that fear is receding and that we can take courage from that alliance 
 with civil society in different countries to support their problem-solving among the afghans inside the palestinian population between the peoples of palestine and israel and as we try to understand this broad movement across the arab world we are not powerless we need to improve the necessary skills 
 and we need the courage to use them in my country i have seen how the council of islamist groups and christian groups came together not as a government initiative but they came together on their own initiative to establish contact and dialogue in times where things were pretty low-key 
 tension and when tension increased they already had that dialogue and that was a strength to deal with different issues our modern western societies are more complex than before in this time of migration how are we going to settle and build a bigger we to deal with our 
 issues if we do n't improve our skills of communication so there are many reasons and for all of these reasons this is time and this is why we must talk thank you for your attention i 'm often asked what surprises you about the book and i said 
 that i got to write it i would have never imagined that not in my wildest dreams did i think i do n't even consider myself to be an author and i 'm often asked why do you think so many people have read this this thing 's selling 
 still about a million copies a month and i think it 's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease i think inside at some point we put our heads down on the pillow and we go there 's got to be more to life than this get up in 
 the morning go to work come home and watch tv go to bed get up in the morning go to work come home watch tv go to bed go to parties on weekends a lot of people say i 'm living no you 're not living that 's just 
 existing just existing i really think that 's there 's this inner desire i do believe what chris said i believe that you 're not an accident your parents may not have planned you but i believe god did i think there are accidental parents there 's no doubt 
 about that i do n't think there are accidental kids and i think you matter i think you matter to god i think you matter to history i think you matter to this universe and i think that the difference between what i call the survival level of living 
 the success level of living and the significant level of living is do you figure out what on earth am i here for i meet a lot of people who are very smart and say but why cannot i figure out my problems and i meet a lot of 
 people who are very successful who say why do n't i feel more fulfilled why do i feel like a fake why do i feel like i've got to pretend that i 'm more than i really am i think that comes down to this issue of meaning 
 of significance of purpose i think it comes down to this issue of why am i here what am i here for where am i going these are not religious issues they 're human issues i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does 
 because it makes my life work a whole lot easier as a pastor i do see a lot of kooks and i have learned that there are kooks in every area of life religion does n't have a monopoly on that but there are plenty of religious kooks 
 there are secular kooks there are smart kooks dumb kooks there are people a lady came up to me the other day and she had a white piece of paper michael you 'll like this one and she said what do you see in it and i looked at it 
 and i said oh i do n't see anything and she goes well i see jesus and started crying and left i 'm going ok you know fine um when the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years i kind of had my 
 little crisis and that was what is the purpose of this because it brought in enormous amounts of money when you write the best-selling book in the world it 's tons and tons of money -- and it brought in a lot of attention neither of which i wanted 
 when i started saddleback church i was 25 years old i started it with one other family in 1980 and i decided that i was never going to go on tv because i did n't want to be a celebrity i did n't want to be a quote 
 evangelist televangelist that 's not my thing and all of a sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention i do n't think now this is a worldview and i will tell you everybody 's got a worldview everybody 's betting their life on something 
 you 're betting your life on something you just better know why you 're betting what you 're betting on so everybody 's betting their life on something and when i you know made a bet i happened to believe that jesus was who he said he was but 
 everybody 's got and i believe in a pluralistic society everybody 's betting on something and when i started the church you know i had no plans to do what it 's doing now and then when i wrote this book and all of a sudden it just took off 
 then i started saying now what 's the purpose of this because as i started to say i do n't think you 're given money or fame for your own ego ever i just do n't believe that and when you write a book that the first sentence of 
 the book is it 's not about you then when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history you got to figure well i guess it 's not about me that 's kind of a no-brainer so what is it for and i began to think 
 about what i call the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence so i believe essentially that leadership is stewardship that if you are a leader in any area in business in politics in sports in art in academics in any area you do n't own it 
 you are a steward of it for instance that 's why i believe in protecting the environment this is not my planet it was n't mine before i was born it 's not going to be mine after i die i 'm just here for 80 years and then that 
 's it i was debating the other day on a talk show and the guy was challenging me and go what 's a pastor doing on protecting the environment and i asked this guy i said well do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world 
 a little bit better place for the next generation do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously and he said no i said oh you do n't i said let me make this clear again do you believe that as human beings i 
 'm not talking about religion do you believe that as human beings it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation and he said no not any more than any other species when he said the word 
 species he was revealing his worldview and he was saying i 'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is well now i know a lot of times we act like ducks but you 're not a duck you 're not a duck 
 and you are responsible that 's my worldview and so you need to understand what your worldview is the problem is most people never really think it through they never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it and say this is what i believe in this is why 
 i believe what i believe i do n't personally have enough faith to be an atheist but you may you may your worldview though does determine everything else in your life because it determines your decisions it determines your relationships it determines your level of confidence it determines 
 really everything in your life what we believe obviously and you know this determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life so all of this money started pouring in and all of this fame started pouring in and i go what do i do with this 
 my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money we said first we 're not going to use it on ourselves i did n't go out and buy a bigger house i do n't own a guesthouse i still drive the same four-year-old 
 ford that i've driven we just said we 're not going to use it on us the second thing was i stopped taking a salary from the church that i pastor third thing is i added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years 
 and i gave it back and i gave it back because i did n't want anybody thinking that i do what i do for money i do n't in fact personally i've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money i 
 know that 's a stereotype i've never met one of them believe me there 's a whole lot easier ways to make money pastors are like on 24-hours-a-day call they 're like doctors i left late today i'd hoped to be here yesterday because my father-in-law is in his last 
 probably 48 hours before he dies of cancer and i 'm watching a guy who 's lived his life he 's now in his mid-80s and he 's dying with peace you know the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times the 
 test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals it makes a difference it makes a difference what you believe so we gave it all back and then we set up three foundations working on some of 
 the major problems of the world illiteracy poverty pandemic diseases particularly hiv/aids and set up these three foundations and put the money into that the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers and that is when my wife and i got married 30 years 
 ago we started tithing now that 's a principle in the bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity give it away to help other people so we started doing that and each year we would raise our tithe 1 percent so our 
 first year of marriage we went to 11 percent second year we went to 12 percent and the third year we went to 13 percent and on and on and on why did i do that because every time i give it breaks the grip of materialism in my life 
 materialism is all about getting get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest it 's all about more having more and we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that 's most important of all 
 looking good feeling good and having the goods but that 's not the good life i meet people all the time who have those and they 're not necessarily happy if money actually made you happy then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest and 
 that i know personally i know is not true it 's just not true so the good life is not about looking good feeling good or having the goods it 's about being good and doing good giving your life away significance in life does n't come from status 
 because you can always find somebody who 's got more than you it does n't come from sex it does n't come from salary it comes from serving it is in giving our lives away that we find meaning we find significance that 's the way we were wired 
 i believe by god and so we began to give away and now after 30 years my wife and i are reverse tithers we give away 90 percent and live on 10 that actually was the easy part the hard part is what do i do with all this attention 
 because i start getting all kinds of invitations i just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents and i wo n't go into that but it was an amazing thing and i 'm going what do i do with this notoriety that the book has 
 brought and being a pastor i started reading the bible there 's a chapter in the bible called psalm 72 and it 's solomon 's prayer for more influence when you read this prayer it sounds incredibly selfish self-centered it sounds like he says god i want you to 
 make me famous that 's what he prays he says i want you to make me famous i want you to spread the fame of my name through every land i want you to give me power i want you to make me famous i want you to give 
 me influence and it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray until you read the whole psalm the whole chapter and then he says so that the king he was the king of israel at that time at its apex 
 in power so that the king may care for the widow and orphan support depressed defend the defenseless care for the sick assist the poor speak up for the foreigner those in prison basically he 's talking about all the marginalized in society and as i read that 
 i looked at it and i thought you know what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence the purpose of influence is not to build your ego or your net worth and by the way your net worth 
 is not the same thing as your self-worth your value is not based on your valuables it 's based on a whole different set of things and so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence and i had to admit i 
 cannot think of the last time i thought of widows and orphans they 're not on my radar i pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of america a bunch of gated communities i have a church full of ceos and scientists and i could go five 
 years and never ever see a homeless person they 're just not in my pathway now they 're 13 miles up the road in santa ana so i had to say ok i would use whatever affluence and whatever influence i've got to help those who do n't have 
 either of those you know there 's a story in the bible about moses whether you believe it 's true or not it really did n't matter to me but moses if you saw the movie the ten commandments moses goes out and there 's this burning bush 
 and god talks to him and god says moses what 's in your hand i think that 's one of the most important questions you 'll ever be asked what 's in your hand moses says it 's a staff it 's a shepherd 's staff and god says 
 throw it down and if you saw the movie you know he throws it down and it becomes a snake and then god says pick it up and he picks it back up again and it becomes a staff again now i 'm reading this thing and i 'm going 
 what is that all about ok what 's that all about well i do know a couple of things number one god never does a miracle to show off it 's not just wow is n't that cool and by the way my god does n't have to show 
 up on cheese bread you know if god 's going to show up he 's not going to show up on cheese bread ok i just this is why i love what michael does because it 's like ok if he 's debunking it then i do n't have 
 to but god my god does n't show up on sprinkler images he got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do but he does n't do miracles just to show off second thing is if god ever asks you a question 
 he already knows the answer obviously if he 's god then that would mean that when he asks the question it 's for your benefit not his so he 's going what 's in your hand now what was in moses hand well it was a shepherd 's staff 
 now follow me on this this staff represented three things about moses life first it represented his identity he was a shepherd it 's the symbol of his own occupation i am a shepherd it 's a symbol of his identity his career his job second it 's a symbol 
 of not only his identity it 's a symbol of his income because all of his assets are tied up in sheep in those days nobody had bank accounts or american express cards or hedge funds your assets are tied up in your flocks so it 's a symbol 
 of his identity and it 's a symbol of his income and the third thing it 's a symbol of his influence what do you do with a shepherd 's staff well you know you move sheep from point a to point b with it by hook or by 
 crook you pull them or you poke them one or the other so he 's saying you 're going to lay down your identity what 's in your hand you've got identity you've got income you've got influence what 's in your hand and he 's saying if 
 you lay it down i 'll make it come alive i 'll do some things you could never imagine possible and if you've watched that movie ten commandments all of those big miracles that happen in egypt are done through this staff last year i was invited to speak at 
 nba all-stars game and so i 'm talking to the players because most of the nba teams nfl teams and all the other teams have done this 40 days of purpose based on the book and i asked them i said what 's in your hand so what 
 's in your hand i said it 's a basketball and that basketball represents your identity who you are you 're an nba player it represents your income you 're making a lot of money off that little ball and it represents your influence and even though you 're only 
 going to be in the nba for a few years you 're going to be an nba player for the rest of your life and that gives with you enormous influence so what are you going to do with what you've been given and i guess that 's the 
 main reason i came up here today to all of you very bright people at ted is to say what 's in your hand what do you have that you've been given talent background education freedom networks opportunities wealth ideas creativity what are you doing
